 <h2 class="head2">To Recover the First Love to the Lord</h2>
<p>We may lose our first love toward the Lord, but by eating Jesus we recover our first love toward Him (Rev. 2:4). The more we eat Him, the more we will appreciate Him, the more we will love Him, and the more we will say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are one with me and I am one with You. I love You, Lord.&rdquo; Eating Him is the best way to recover our love for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Keep the Church as the Lampstand</h2>
<p>Eating Christ as the tree of life is also the way to keep the church as the lampstand (Rev. 2:5). The lampstand is the bright, shining testimony. If the saints in a locality do not know how to enjoy Christ, to eat Christ daily, sooner or later the lampstand, the testimony of the Lord, will be removed from that locality. If on the other hand, the saints enjoy the Lord Jesus, eating Him by pray-reading in a rich way, there will be a bright shining lampstand as the testimony of Jesus in that locality.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus warned the church in Ephesus to &ldquo;repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent&rdquo; (Rev. 2:5). The way to keep the lampstand and recover the first love toward Him is to eat Jesus as the tree of life. This eating will keep the testimony of Jesus so living and bright in your locality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING CHRIST AS THE HIDDEN MANNA</h2>
<p>John 6:31-35 shows that the manna in Exodus 16 was a type of the Lord Jesus being the bread of life. The manna, which came as the daily food supply for the children of Israel, was a type of the Lord Jesus as our daily food. In Revelation 2:17 the Lord Jesus promised to give the overcomers in the church in Pergamos, the worldly church, to eat of the hidden manna. The hidden manna signifies the hidden Christ as a special portion reserved for the Lord&rsquo;s overcoming seekers who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. The way to overcome all kinds of degradation in the church life is to eat and enjoy Jesus as the hidden manna, which was a special portion of manna preserved in a golden pot concealed in the ark (Exo. 16:32-34; Heb. 9:4). While the church goes the way of the world, the overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply. This promise is fulfilled today in the proper church life and will be fulfilled in full in the coming kingdom. If we seek the Lord, overcome the degradation of the worldly church, and enjoy a special portion of the Lord today, He as the hidden manna will be a reward to us in the coming kingdom. If we miss Him as our special portion today in the church life, we will surely lose the enjoyment of Him as a reward in the coming kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Overcome the Teaching of the Nicolaitans</h2>
<p>If we eat Jesus in a hidden way, we will overcome the practice and teaching of hierarchy signified by the deeds and teaching of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:6, 15). The teaching of the Nicolaitans is the teaching of hierarchy, which creates two distinct classes&mdash;the clergy and the laity. This was undoubtedly the hierarchy followed and established by Catholicism and Protestantism. This hierarchy creates a wide gap between the clergy and the laity. The way to overcome the practice and teaching of hierarchy is eat the hidden Jesus. As we eat Jesus in a hidden way, He becomes our energy of life within to overcome the deeds and teaching of the Nicolaitans.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, God has made all the believers in Christ priests (Rev. 1:6; 5:10; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). As believers, we all are priests and are not members of the clergy or of the laity. We are New Testament priests serving God with all the members of Christ.</p>
