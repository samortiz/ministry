<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>An introductory word:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;After my study of the Bible for the past sixty-nine years, what have I seen? I would say that I have seen the New Jerusalem. This is my vision, this is my revelation, and this is my ministry&rdquo; (<em>The Practical Points concerning Blending,</em> pp. 25-26):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;In these years the Lord has shown us the crystallized significance of the New Jerusalem: it is a mingling, a constitution, of the Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people&rdquo; (<em>The Governing and Controlling Visionof the Bible,</em> p. 40).</li>
		<li>&ldquo;First, we need to release the truth that God became a man so that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. Then we need to release the truth concerning the New Jerusalem. My burden is to release these two great truths&rdquo; (<em>The Application of the Interpretation of the New Jerusalem to the Seeking Believers,</em> p. 54):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>&ldquo;The New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of the Bible, involves God becoming man and man becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead, and God and man being mingled together to be one entity&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp;2 Samuel,</em> p. 203).</li>
			<li>&ldquo;The New Jerusalem is a composition of God&rsquo;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified people who have been deified&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Job,</em> p. 122).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>&ldquo;The ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s complete salvation is the New Jerusalem&mdash;the crystallization of the union and mingling of God with man, the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect&rdquo; (<em>The Organic Aspect of God&rsquo;s Salvation,</em> p. 74):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>&ldquo;The New Jerusalem is the embodiment of God&rsquo;s full salvation, and God&rsquo;s full salvation is a composition of God&rsquo;s righteousness as the base and God&rsquo;s life as the consummation&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Isaiah,</em> p. 349).</li>
			<li>&ldquo;The consummation of God&rsquo;s organic salvation is the New Jerusalem&mdash;the universal incorporation of the union and mingling of divinity with humanity&mdash;the processed and consummated Triune God incorporated with His regenerated, renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite elect&rdquo; (<em>The Experience of God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation Equaling Reigning in Christ&rsquo;s Life,</em> p. 41).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>&ldquo;We should teach only that which remains in the New Jerusalem&rdquo; (<em>Crystallization-study of James,</em> p. 43).</li>
		<li>&ldquo;I hope that many of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would go around the globe telling people everywhere nothing else but the New Jerusalem&rdquo; (<em>The Application of the Interpretation of the New Jerusalem to the Seeking Believers,</em> p. 41).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Becoming the New Jerusalem and building the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 3:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;Eventually, the triune, eternal God becomes the New Jerusalem incorporated with all of us. We do not enter into the New Jerusalem; we become the New Jerusalem. Our becoming is our entering in&rdquo; (<em>Crystallization-study of the Gospel of John,</em> p. 148).</li>
		<li>&ldquo;The New Jerusalem is built by God&rsquo;s constituting Himself into man to make man the same as God in life, in nature, and in constitution so that God and man may become a corporate entity&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Chronicles,</em> p. 36):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>&ldquo;The God-men build up the Body of Christ for the building of the New Jerusalem. We are building up something in this age&mdash;the Body of Christ&mdash;that is for something in the next age&mdash; the New Jerusalem&rdquo; (<em>The God-men,</em> p. 57).</li>
			<li>&ldquo;What I am doing is building the New Jerusalem and will be consummated in the New Jerusalem&rdquo; (<em>Crystallization-studyof Song of Songs,</em> p. 27).</li>
			<li>&ldquo;How glorious it is that we are now building up the New Jerusalem! Are you not such a builder? We all are co-builders, building an eternal dwelling place for ourselves&rdquo; (<em>The God-men,</em> p. 59).</li>
			</ol></li>

<li>The New Jerusalem is the corporate God-man&mdash;the enlargement, expansion, and expression of God&mdash; the corporate God&mdash;Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10-12; Rev. 4:3; 21:10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Jerusalem is a composition of divinity and humanity blended and mingled together as one entity; all the components have the same life, nature, and constitution, and thus are a corporate person&mdash;vv. 2, 10-21.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the expansion and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, built up, conformed, and glorified people&mdash; vv. 10-11.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is God Himself enlarged with His redeemed by the way of constituting, uniting, and mingling&mdash;John 3:29a, 30a; 14:20; 15:4a; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is God&rsquo;s enlargement and expansion, God&rsquo;s expression in eternity, which is the corporate God&mdash;Gen. 1:1; John 1:1, 14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rev. 22:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Genesis 1 God is only <em>Elohim,</em> but He planned to have Himself, the unlimited Triune God, enlarged to be the New Jerusalem as seen in Revelation 21 and 22&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9, 11; Rev. 4:11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the beginning of the Bible, there is one single God; at the end there is a corporate God&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash;21:2.</li>
			<li>In the beginning He is the simple God, who is triune; at the end a city appears, and that is the corporate God&mdash;v. 10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Those who participate in the New Jerusalem are all God&rsquo;s children, God&rsquo;s kind, God&rsquo;s species; hence, the New Jerusalem is the corporate God&mdash;John 1:12-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Rom. 8:29; Rev. 21:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is the firstborn Son, and we are His many &ldquo;twins&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. 2:11-12.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem is God the Father with many &ldquo;God the sons&rdquo;&mdash;Rev. 21:7; Heb. 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the aggregate, the totality, of the many God-men&mdash;Rev. 21:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to make the believers God-men for the constitution of the Body of Christ that the New Jerusalem may be consummated as the eternal enlargement and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash; Gal. 3:26; 4:7, 26, 31.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem is the God-men who have been transformed, glorified, and mingled with the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash;John 17:22-23a; Eph. 4:4-6.</li>
		<li>The issue of the Bible&rsquo;s teaching is just one entity, the New Jerusalem, as the aggregate of all the God-men&mdash;Rev. 21:7; Heb. 2:10-11; 12:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The ultimate purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation is to work on all those whom He chose in eternity to such an extent that they become wholly like Him in the divine glory to express the glorious image of God as jasper for His eternal enlargement and expression&mdash;Rev. 4:3; 21:10-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s purpose in creating the universe is to produce such jasper&mdash;4:11; Eph. 1:9, 11; 3:11; Rom. 8:28; 2 Tim. 1:9.</li>
		<li>We are in the process of being made &ldquo;a piece of God,&rdquo; to look the same as God&mdash;jasper&mdash;Rev. 4:3; 21:11.</li>
