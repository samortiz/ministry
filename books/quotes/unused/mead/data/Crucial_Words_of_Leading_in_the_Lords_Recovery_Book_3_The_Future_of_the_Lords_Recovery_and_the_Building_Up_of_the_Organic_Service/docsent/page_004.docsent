   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NUMBERS BEING THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In serving the Lord in the localities, we must understand that people are our capital.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can the work spread if our numbers remain the same for five years?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can we increase?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must learn practical lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not sufficient just to lead people to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must also pay attention to our numbers; otherwise, we have no foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the time of Pentecost the Lord saved three thousand people in one day through Peter, and on another day He saved five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a short time there were eight thousand new believers, and they could function.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot go to a place and merely lead the saints to study the Bible or help them to be spiritual; neither should we be satisfied with a few saints gathering together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must realize that according to church history, spiritual giants have failed because they paid attention only to being spiritual; they disregarded everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, they had no posterity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must not take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us use our body as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our health is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we pay attention to education and gaining knowledge at the expense of our physical health, in the end we will have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there are no people in the church, the church has nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have the same number of people for twenty years, not much can be accomplished or developed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were in Taiwan for thirty-five years before we spread to America.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I now see our young people whose parents were married after we began the work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When their parents were young, their families were very poor, but today these young people have doctoral degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows that our young people have potential.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If one has descendants, he has hope; having descendants is more beneficial than having a doctoral degree or great wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One son of a brother who was a cab driver obtained his doctoral degree in America, and his brother became a medical doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This father is very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose we only preserve a group of older saints by leading them to study the Bible and be spiritual, and after twenty years we still have the same group of saints but no new ones have been added.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our work will have no spread, no second generation, and no future.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Having a second generation depends on our numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we had continued the work according to our service during the first seven years in Taiwan, our numbers today would be very large.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hong Kong has a population of more than five million people, and the church there has a thirty-five-year history.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1950 Brother Nee brought in a revival in Hong Kong; that was also the year he arranged for me to go there and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the first few years that I was there, everything flourished.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the church had continued to increase at the same rate, there would be at least thirty thousand saints in the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the church had been willing to follow our early practice in Taiwan having meetings in halls, districts, and groups it would have at least twenty to thirty thousand brothers and sisters today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must pay attention to numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We want our numbers to increase, but we cannot use the methods in Christianity, such as speaking in tongues, miraculous healings, and gaining material prosperity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to serve with the truth, the divine life, the church, and the gospel, and we need to meet in halls, districts, and groups.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do this, our numbers will spontaneously increase.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am setting this matter before you for our consideration, fellowship, and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must learn not to be satisfied with our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother Sparks is a good warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No one spoke higher than he from the standpoint of spiritual ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, eventually the Lord had no way to go on in his group, because he did not want the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are able to maintain a certain number of people, because we have the church life, but if we reject the church life, we will have nothing, not even numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE SECOND GENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>OF OUR WORK DEPENDING ON NUMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many years ago I did not understand how a ministry as high as Brother Sparks s could come to almost nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now I am clear that it is because he did not care for the church or for meeting in halls and districts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This can be compared to a person who pursues a doctoral degree but does not care for his physical health.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He may eventually obtain his degree, but he will lose his health.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even though the brother who was a cab driver never obtained a doctoral degree, he was healthy, and he raised two children who were both very successful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He has a second generation, a continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should examine our work to see whether there is a second generation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This depends on numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must gain a good number of people and maintain them in order to carry out the work in the way we desire.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our capital lies in our numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must have capital before we can accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By the Lord s mercy there are two to three thousand saints between the ages of twenty-five and forty in Taipei who have a heart to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We look to the Lord to know how to motivate these two or three thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We hope that at least one or two hundred full-time serving ones can be produced from among them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In previous messages we spoke concerning being called.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul was a full-timer, but he also made tents for a living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that we should not think that full-timers cannot have a job.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not have this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Taiwan is peaceful and prosperous, and we have two to three thousand saints who are college graduates.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should encourage them to give some of their time to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the past, Christianity preached the gospel by establishing a mission board, collecting donations, and hiring the people whom they trained and sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes, however, the people they sent out would preach the gospel for seven to eight years and gain only five or six people.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today Taiwan is full of human capital.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many young people have been constrained by the Lord s love, and they desire to be trained and sent out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Several thousand young people have consecrated themselves for this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I believe that the Lord will surely take care of their living.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I also hope we can learn to do a living work, not a dead work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When I returned to Taiwan in 1966, I was concerned about the number of young people in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There were over a hundred high schools, colleges, and universities, and there were many brothers and sisters in these schools.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We even had more than three hundred brothers and sisters studying at National Taiwan University.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This was a time when we needed to know how many brothers and sisters were in the schools in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In 1966 I suggested that we aim for ten thousand children in the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At present, we do not have even two thousand children in the children s meetings; there may be only five hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This situation is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have three thousand five hundred brothers and sisters who regularly attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we consider every couple to be a household unit, we should have more than one thousand households.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>And if every household has two children, we should have more than two thousand children.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But we have only five hundred children in the children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This proves that there is a big lack in the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We speak concerning spirituality and the divine life every day, but there is no progress in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is not acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must rise up to care for these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We need to know the number of saints in the church in Taipei, how many households there are, how many children are in the households, and the ages and grades of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should get this information in the shortest time possible.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then we will know how many teachers we need for the children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If all the brothers and sisters teach the children, we will quickly have four to five thousand children.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We fellowshipped concerning the children s work in 1966; that was eighteen years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A child who was twelve years old at that time would be thirty now.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In other words, the children whom we cared for in 1966 are at least thirty years old now.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we had worked with ten thousand children in 1966, we would have ten thousand young brothers and sisters today.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Some may say that our present situation is according to God s will; otherwise, there might be false believers among us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>However, we must have quantity before we can have quality.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Of course, not all the children would have remained, but at least sixty percent would have remained; out of ten thousand children at least six thousand would be in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Now we are busy doing our best to preach the gospel, but the number of people we have saved still has not reached six thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Beginning in 1966, if the church in Taipei had focused on only the children s work, there would be at least six thousand brothers and sisters who were properly brought up in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We must give this careful consideration.</S>
