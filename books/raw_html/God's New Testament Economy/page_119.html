 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEW JERUSALEM&mdash;<br />
ITS DIMENSIONS, ITS TEMPLE, AND ITS LIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:15-16, 22-24a; 22:5; Deut. 33:27; Psa. 90:1</h1>
<h2 class="head1">ITS DIMENSIONS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Number Twelve</h2>
<p>The dimensions of the New Jerusalem are stressed in Revelation 21:15-16. We have seen that twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem and that the height of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits which is twelve times twelve. Revelation 21:16 tells us that the length, breadth, and height of the city are twelve thousand stadia. Twelve thousand, of course, is one thousand times twelve. Ten is a number of completion in the Scriptures, but it is not as complete as a hundred or even one thousand. The Psalmist tells us that a day in the Lord&rsquo;s courts is better than a thousand (Psa. 84:10). The number one thousand is a complete unit, and in God&rsquo;s eyes one thousand years is equal to one day (2 Pet. 3:8). This indicates that one thousand is the ultimate completion in God&rsquo;s figuration. Since twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion in God&rsquo;s administration, twelve thousand signifies a thousand times this.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Holy of Holies</h2>
<p>The measurement of the New Jerusalem shows us that it is a cube with three equal dimensions. This means that the entire New Jerusalem is straight, perfect, and complete, without any defect, bias, obliqueness, or shortage. The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, both in the tabernacle and the temple, are equal in length, breadth, and height (Exo. 26:2-8; 1 Kings 6:20). Hence, that the length, the breadth, and the height of the New Jerusalem are equal signifies that the entire New Jerusalem will be the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Measured with a Golden Reed</h2>
<p>The city is also measured with a golden reed. The reed is for measuring, and measuring signifies to take possession (Ezek. 40:5; Zech. 2:1-2; Rev. 11:1). Since gold signifies the divine nature of God, the golden reed signifies that the measuring of the city, its gates and its wall, is according to God&rsquo;s divine nature. Anything that does not match the divine nature of God does not belong to the New Jerusalem. The whole city, with its gates and wall, can pass the measuring and testing of the divine nature of God; hence, it is fitting for God&rsquo;s possession. A reed is not that strong, but the nature of the measuring reed for the New Jerusalem is golden. The holy city is not measured according to man&rsquo;s concept, idea, philosophy, or qualification, but according to God&rsquo;s divine nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Square City</h2>
<p>The city lying foursquare (Rev. 21:16a), signifies that the New Jerusalem is perfect and complete in every way, absolutely straight, without any obliqueness. God&rsquo;s divine nature is absolutely perfect and eternally complete for God&rsquo;s divine administration. On this earth today there is no government which is perfect. Every government is full of defects, bias, and crookedness. In God&rsquo;s eternal, divine administration, however, there is nothing but perfection and completion. The governments of this earth are full of politicians, but in the church we have to learn one thing&mdash;do not play politics. In the church, when we say yes we mean yes, and when we say no we mean no (2 Cor. 1:17-20). When we say black we mean black, and when we say white we mean white. In the church there is no &ldquo;gray color.&rdquo; The holy city is not a round city but a square city. To be &ldquo;round&rdquo; means to play politics. If you told me that I was a round person, I would feel ashamed. We all need to be &ldquo;square persons&rdquo; who are so frank, straight, and open. The city&rsquo;s being equal in three dimensions as a cube means that the city is perfect to the uttermost with no defects, bias, or obliqueness. The city&rsquo;s being square has a very spiritual significance. Here there is no politics, no crookedness, and here is God&rsquo;s frankness, faithfulness, and openness.</p>
