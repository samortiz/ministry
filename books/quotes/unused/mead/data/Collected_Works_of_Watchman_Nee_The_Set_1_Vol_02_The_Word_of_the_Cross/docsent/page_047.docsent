   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT IS THE HIGHER CRITICISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF MODERN THEOLOGY BELIEVABLE?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The higher criticism is formulated by those who do not believe in the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since its founders hold this view, can a Christian follow these teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christianity has only one book that reveals the Christian concept concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This book is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible is God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Saying that the Bible is fabricated and not the Word of God is equivalent to saying that God has never revealed Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God has not revealed Himself, how can we know that there is a God and know the way to approach Him?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we were sinners, how did we know that believing in the Lord Jesus' vicarious death on the cross for us would result in our salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible is God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the higher critics say that the Bible is unreliable and deny the authenticity of its record, they deny the fact that God has revealed Himself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if God has not revealed Himself, how can the higher critics know God and serve Him?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The higher critics try to determine how much of the Bible is divinely inspired and how much is not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But they cannot come to a conclusive determination on the proportion of divine inspiration in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are almost as many different conclusions about the Bible as there are critics!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the critics themselves cannot arrive at a common belief and judgment, how can they ask others to believe what they believe?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not believe that the Bible is inerrant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They set up their own standard of measurement and consider that standard to be inerrant!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The inerrancy of the Bible is changed to the inerrancy of their own standard.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They say that certain passages are not authentic based on their own philosophy and standard of measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This clearly puts their philosophy and standard of measurement as the unique and inerrant guide.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Are their philosophies reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Are their standards of measurement inerrant?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are Christ and the testimony of the Bible more reliable, or are human philosophies more reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The critics think that because they live in the twentieth century they know more than the Jewish historians who lived a few thousand years ago!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The critics belong to the twentieth century, yet they think that they know the thoughts of men who lived a few thousand years ago and that they know the way God revealed Himself to these ancient men!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They also think that the ancient writers have the same mentality as the critics, and that language itself has never changed!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is it true that ancient men were the same in their mentality?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Is it true that there has never been a change in language?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A professor at Trinity College in Foochow once said, "Someone conducted an examination of Napoleon according to the method of the higher critics, and they arrived at the conclusion that Napoleon never existed!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The minds of these critics are diametrically opposed to the declarations of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to build up their philosophy, these critics must first attack the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There really are no facts to substantiate their theories; there are only suppositions!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the evidences in archeology stand as a testimony against their philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many of their suppositions have been proven to be false.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, they say that written language was not widely used in Moses' time, but this has been proven to be false.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Modern theologians try to remove the "obstacles" in the Bible that prevent men from believing according to their intellect.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In so doing, they leave men without a Bible to believe in!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If one portion of the Bible can be removed, all portions of the Bible can be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They reject the record of creation as recorded by Moses because the story of creation contradicts the theory of evolution.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They reject the record of Jonah in the belly of the fish because it is too supernatural.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They reject the record of the birth of the Lord Jesus through a virgin because it is too mysterious and hard to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a result they conclude that He was merely the son of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since resurrection is impossible, according to man, they have no other recourse but to keep Christ buried in the grave forever!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If these "obstacles" are removed, will the Bible still be the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when the "obstacles" are removed this way, they create more obstacles.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The obstacles which they create, that is, the problems they cannot solve, are often more numerous than the things they have tried to remove!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Strictly speaking, modern theology is an offspring of evolution.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It has never been proven and never can be proven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Darwinism is its father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The higher critics cannot help men to be saved, and they cannot help men to advance spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"By their fruits you will recognize them" Matt 7:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Other than being an enemy of God and blaspheming the God who authored the Bible, what achievements have the higher critics made in the world and the church?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They do not lead people to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the contrary, they corrupt men's faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the result of the work of the higher critics.</S>
