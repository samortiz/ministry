   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Likes to See Men Asking Great Things from Him</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In studying the Gospels carefully, we find that the Lord took pleasure in men asking Him for great favor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The greater men's requests were, the happier the Lord was to answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 "If You Are Willing, You Can Cleanse Me"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consider the story of the leper in Mark 1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Jewish regulations, a leper could not come in contact with any man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Any person who came in contact with a leper was defiled by uncleanness Lev 13 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here a leper came to see the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The very act of coming to the Lord was quite presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should have a strong impression of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As soon as a leper appeared on the scene, we probably would react.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Unless a man was ready to sacrifice himself and give his all, he would jump back at the sight of a leper and say, "You are hurting me!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I cannot touch you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why do you come to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the leper came to the Lord, he did not ask whether the Lord could cleanse him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead he said, "If You are willing, You can cleanse me" Mark 1:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was a very piercing statement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He put all the burden on the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was all a matter of whether or not the Lord was willing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was not an ordinary prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was something that put the Lord's heart to the test.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord simply could have said, "Be clean," and the leper would have been cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Lord did not merely utter a word; He identified Himself with the leper's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He touched the leper with His hand and said, "I am willing; be cleansed!" v. 41 . If he was not cleansed, the Lord would become defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What a risk this would have involved!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must have the proper impression of the story before we can understand the actual picture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord was ready to put Himself into the leper's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He joined His holiness and purity to the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Either both would be clean or both would be defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Either both had to go outside the camp or both could return to the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord was ready to spend, and what a spending that was!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>2 "They Removed the Roof"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Mark 2 records four men carrying a paralytic to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being unable to bring him to the Lord because of the crowd, they removed the roof where He was, and lowered the paralytic to the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should have an impression of this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many people were surrounding the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was quite busy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But now another group lowered a paralytic from the roof!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should realize that the Lord was not just busy; He was also speaking in a borrowed place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the roof was removed, it had to be patched later.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What trouble this was!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the Lord did not say, "Do not do this again."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead He was happy that someone would come to Him with such a big demand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It seems that the bigger the demand was, the happier He felt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shows us what kind of Lord He is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not have a clear impression of what the Lord has done, how can we say that we know Him?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>3 "Jesus, Son of David, Have Mercy on Me!"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As the Lord was traveling, Bartimaeus cried out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Mark 10:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many people rebuked him and tried to silence him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But he cried out much more.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus was not particularly fond of noise and excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Matthew 12:19 says, "He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was what the Lord Jesus was like.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But here was a man crying out in a loud way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He wanted the Lord to have mercy on him, and the Lord healed him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord is happy to see men asking great things from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He wants men to open their mouths wide.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is happy to give grace in abounding measure.</S>
