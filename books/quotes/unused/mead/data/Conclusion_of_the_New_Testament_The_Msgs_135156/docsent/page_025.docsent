   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b For Them to Be Saved in His Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ's living in us is also for us to be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"If, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life" Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse speaks of both the reconciling death of Christ and the saving life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although we have been saved already through Christ's death, we still need to be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, we have been saved from hell and the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was accomplished once for all through the death of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, we still need to be saved in Christ's life from many subjective problems.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be saved in Christ's life is actually to be saved in the person of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as we are in Him, we are in the process of being saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To live in Christ is to be saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As Christ lives in us, dispensing Himself into our being, we live in Him and are saved in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ lives in us to save us continuously in His life. c For Them to Live through Him by Eating Him as the Bread of Life</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ's living in the believers is also for them to live through Him by eating Him as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life" John 6:48 , and "He who eats Me shall also live because of Me" v. 57b . The bread of life is the life supply in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is not only life to us; He, as the bread of life, is our life supply to sustain our spiritual life in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, as He lives in us, we live through Him by eating Him as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we eat Christ as the bread of life, we shall live through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eating is to take food into us to be assimilated into our body organically.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, to eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we live through Him whom we receive. d For Them to Live with Him</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1 Thessalonians 5:10 Paul says that Christ "died for us that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with Him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus died for us not only that we may be saved from eternal perdition but also that, through His living in us, we may live together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may live together with Him whether we watch or sleep, that is, whether we live or die.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, the Lord Jesus is away from us and we are awaiting His coming back; on the other hand, He is with us Matt 28:20 , and we can live together with Him Rom 6:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, in the divine dispensing Christ's living in us is for us to live with Him. e For Them to Live Him</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, "Christ lives in me," and in Philippians 1:21a he says, "To me to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that Christ lives in us that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may have heard of living for Christ, living out Christ, and living by Christ but not of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To live by Christ and for Christ and to live out Christ are all somewhat different from simply living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Adding a preposition changes the denotation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are living by Christ, we are still doing the living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To live Christ means that Christ is our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we live, He lives.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He lives, we live.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not merely live out Christ, live by Christ, live with Christ, live in Christ, and live for Christ we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ's living in us is for us to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, Christ lives in us; on the other hand, we should live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that inwardly Christ is our life and outwardly Christ is our living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We and Christ thus have one life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ's life is our life, and our living is Christ's living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we and Christ live as one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To live Christ is not merely to live a holy life, and it is not simply to be spiritual and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To live Christ is to live a person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is to live a life that is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because Christ lives in us, we, through the divine dispensing, should live Him and thereby be one with Him both in life and in living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Day by day we need to practice living Christ, taking Him as our life and person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The central thought in the Bible is that Christ should be our life and that we should live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The goal of being a Christian, therefore, is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the destiny God has ordained for us in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today the processed Triune God is dispensing Himself into us so that we may take Christ as our life, our life supply, and our person in order to live Him.</S>
