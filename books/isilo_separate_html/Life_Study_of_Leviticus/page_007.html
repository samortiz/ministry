THE OFFERINGS IN RELATION TO THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>The books of Exodus and Leviticus are closely related. Exodus ends with the setting up of the tabernacle, and Leviticus begins with the offerings. Both the tabernacle and the offerings are types of Christ. The fact that Exodus ends with the tabernacle and Leviticus begins with the offerings indicates a direct continuation. Although Exodus and Leviticus are different in nature and in their points, there is nevertheless a direct relation between them.<h2 class=head2>A. The Tabernacle Built and Set Up, and the Offerings with the Priesthood Ordained</h2><p>In Exodus the tabernacle was built and set up. The tabernacle was set up not only for God to dwell in but also for us to dwell in. In Leviticus the offerings (chs. 1-7) with the priesthood (chs. 8-10) are ordained.<h2 class=head2>B. Christ as the Tabernacle Bringing God to Man, and Christ as the Offerings Bringing Man to God</h2><p>Because our Christ is wonderful and all-inclusive, plain words are not adequate to reveal Him and describe Him. Types, which are actually pictures, are also necessary. Both the tabernacle and the offerings are types of Christ. Christ as the tabernacle brings God to man, and Christ as the offerings brings man to God. This indicates that there is a two-way traffic, a traffic coming and going. Christ comes to us as the tabernacle and He goes to God as the offerings.<p>The tabernacle is a sign, a figure, a type, of Christ. It was through incarnation that Christ came as the tabernacle. The Word, which was God, became flesh and tabernacled among us (John 1:1, 14). Christ is the very God incarnated to be a man; hence, He is the God-man, and this God-man is the tabernacle. As the tabernacle, Christ brought God to man. Christ&#8217;s being on earth was a matter of God embodied in a tabernacle. Here we have one aspect of the two-way traffic- God coming to us in Christ through incarnation.<p>John 1:29 tells us that the Christ who is the tabernacle is also the Lamb of God: &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; Christ as the Lamb of God is the totality, the aggregate, of all the offerings.<p>On the one hand, Christ is the tabernacle; on the other hand, He is the offerings. As the tabernacle, He has brought God to us. As the offerings, He is now bringing us all to God. Christ&#8217;s being the tabernacle is a matter of incarnation. Christ&#8217;s being the offerings is a matter of crucifixion and resurrection. Christ came in incarnation and He went through crucifixion and resurrection. This is the two-way traffic that brings God to us and brings us to God, making God one with us and us one with God.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
