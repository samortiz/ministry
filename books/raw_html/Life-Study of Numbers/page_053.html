<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ENJOYING CHRIST AS THE EDIBLE,<br>DRINKABLE, AND ENTERABLE ONE</H2><P>Along with the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering, we have a basket of bread, cakes, wafers, and the drink offering. The bread, the cakes, and the wafers typify Christ in different aspects as our food supply. The drink offering is also a type of Christ. As the real drink offering, Christ has been poured out to satisfy God and also to satisfy us. As the bread, the cakes, and the wafers, Christ is edible, and as the drink offering, He is drinkable.</P><P>Our Christ is not only edible and drinkable&#151;He is also enterable. By eating and drinking Him, we enter into Him, and He enters into us to become our very being. Our Christ is enterable! Now we are in Him, and He is in us.</P><P>The Christian life is a life of daily partaking of the divine provisions. This means that we should not try in ourselves and in our natural strength to live the Christian life. The hair, which signifies the natural strength, must be shaved off (8:7), indicating that our natural strength must be cut off. Instead of relying on our natural strength, we should simply partake of and enjoy all the divine provisions.</P><P>The last item of the divine provisions revealed in Numbers 6 through 9 is the Passover. In the following message we will consider the record concerning the Passover in 9:1-14.</P>
