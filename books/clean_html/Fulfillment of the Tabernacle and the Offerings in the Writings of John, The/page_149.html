<h2 class=head1>THE LIFE</h2><p>In 14:6 the Lord Jesus goes on to say that He is the life. Reality is the divine life, and the divine life, which is eternal life, is the Triune God. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the Triune God comes into us to be our life. Therefore, the life in 14:6 signifies the Triune God within us (Eph. 4:18; Col. 3:4a; Rom. 8:2a, 6b).<p>Many of us can testify that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we sense that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in us. We have something living, moving, and acting within us. This is the Triune God within us as the divine life. This life brings us the reality, and the reality is the way for us to enter into God. This is the way, and the way is the destination.<p>Whenever we call on the Lord Jesus, we experience the Triune God within us as life. This is the divine life that brings us reality, and this reality is the way. When we are on the way, we are also at the destination.<p>Do you know where we are today? We are where the Son is—in the Father. We may say that we are in the Son with the Father and also in the Father with the Son. This is the oneness between us and the Triune God. Jesus Christ is in the Father, and we are in Him also. Where He is, there we are also. He is in the Father, and we are in the Father by being in Him. This means that through Christ as the way we have been brought into God. The life brings us the reality, the reality is the way, the way is one with the destination, and this destination is God and the Father Himself.<p>Those who fear and honor God but do not believe in the Lord Jesus would have to testify that they never have had the sense that God is in them and that they are in God. Instead, they may realize that they are sinful and that they have the problems with the world, Satan, and other negative things. They may have a God who is in the heavens, but not a God who dwells within them. Our experience as believers in Christ is absolutely different. We have the assurance to say with a pure conscience, “God is in me, and I am in God. God and I are one. All the obstacles between us have been removed. Sin, the world, Satan, and the old creation have all been dealt with. Now I have life and reality, and this reality is the way. I am on the way, and I reach the destination. I have God, the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.”<p>In 14:6 the Lord Jesus clearly says, “I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.” Because Christ is the way, the reality, and the life, when we have Him, we have the life, the reality, and the way. When we are on the way, we are also at the destination. Our testimony and experience is that we are in the Triune God and the Triune God is in us.
