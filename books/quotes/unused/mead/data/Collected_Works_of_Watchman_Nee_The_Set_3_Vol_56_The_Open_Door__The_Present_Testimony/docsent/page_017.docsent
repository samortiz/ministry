   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Longing in Bangkok</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are more than ten brothers and sisters in Bangkok, but we still do not have the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We only have a prayer meeting every Lord's Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have now built a meeting hall that can seat two hundred to prepare for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The brothers and sisters are all burning and hoping that the Lord would send some here to work and lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We also hope that the brothers and sisters in other localities would pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A weak member in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lin Zong-hai</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>November 11, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hoping That the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Would First Gain Me and Us Xiangcheng</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the twenty-first issue of The Open Door I read that the Lord had touched you about gaining several spiritual groups into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I feel that this is really right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I will briefly state my thoughts below.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was baptized into the Lord by Brother Wu Chung-san in Lushan County of this province in 1941.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was also shepherded by Brother Hao Ping-ru for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1949 I returned to Xiangcheng from Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I studied for two years at Ling Xiu Seminary in Ningbo.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not feel that I can trust myself in the light of the truth, and I am even more afraid of leading others astray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Lord allows, I hope "to grasp the opportunity," so that He would first gain myself and then us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In August 1948 I was not home , the brothers in Beiguan invited an evangelist from the China Inland Mission in Nanguan to come preach for a week.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Another brother offered up his house, and the worship began.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the work of the China Inland Mission stopped, the assembly in Nanguan established itself independently and has become self-supporting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the gospel work in the spring of this year, thirty-three people were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are now forty-five who attend the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Kuo Shou-shan</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>September 24, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He Had Mercy on Us Yuyao</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have felt that we should begin to have prayer meetings in Yuyao for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In February 1949 Brother Huang Xun-min met together with us to pray in a sister's house.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The work was not very prevailing because we did not have enough light and our flesh was weak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Huang left Yuyao later, and we were even more isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We could only look to God to make a way for us and to give us brothers and sisters with the same heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank God that last fall he gave us a brother, Pan Wen-jun, and a sister, Yen Wen-chin, who are in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, we learned that churches had been started in Ningpo and the surrounding localities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This made us very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we had a gospel meeting on the following Lord's Day afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although there were not many people, we saw that some were willing to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings we have prayer, Bible study, and hymn-singing meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise God for having mercy on us despite our laziness and weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From now on we hope that God will lead us more in His will, and we also hope that the brothers and sisters everywhere will pray much for us so that we would be strong to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Pan Wen-jun, Lou Shang-kuan, and Lu Cheng-hsien</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>January 9, 1951</S>
