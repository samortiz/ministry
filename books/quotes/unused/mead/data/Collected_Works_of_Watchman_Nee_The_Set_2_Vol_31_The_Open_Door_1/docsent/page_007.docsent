   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Letter from Brother Chen Jeng-fan,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mr. X, my brother in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It has been a few months since we parted in Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Recalling our discourse there and reflecting on it today, I still savor its taste.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not long after our farewell, I left Canton and arrived at Foochow via Hong Kong, Swatow, and Amoy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After a brief conversation with the brothers, I left for the city of Yung.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After working there for more than a month, I left again for the co-workers' meeting in Chuanchow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I had planned to work at Sien-You after the conference in Chuanchow, but a letter from the brothers in Foochow urged me to promptly return to take charge of the newly rented hall at Tai-Jiang-Xun.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Honoring their wish, I consented without hesitation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I arrived in Foochow on the fifth of July and have been working until this day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the past four months, in spite of the grave political condition, by God's grace the work has never ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every night we see the working of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>More than X people have signed their name upon believing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although one cannot say they all are genuine, there is a good number among them who have a good testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, among those who believe, the majority are from Yah-Mei-Jou, Jung-Dang-Hou-Jou, Jung-Ting-Jie, Chang-Hsia-Jou, and the nearby riverside regions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most of them are workers of industry or commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since they have no relationship with the denominational Christians, this work is a pioneering one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a new work is to commence in the future, these ones can be considered the basic members.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Recently, because of the need of the circumstances, the edifying work has started; there are now meetings in two places, with the breaking of bread and other work going on without conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The situation is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am concerned about how they will go on in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you have any foresight in this matter, I hope to receive your instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regarding the work here, I feel that we are short in several areas: 1 The meeting hall is too small and can only accommodate one to two hundred people; 2 there are too few brothers who can take responsibility directly; 3 being alone and weak, I may not be able to continue for a long stretch of time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please beseech the Lord to raise up more responsible brothers and workers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Pray also for me so that I may be freed from living by Hagar's bottled water and may enter into the realm of living springs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How is the recent situation in Hankow?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please greet Brother Lan for me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we feel no impact of the war, all walks of life remain calm, and work continues as usual.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition, my mortal frame is as healthy as ever.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord willing, I hope to see you soon that I may be taught and benefited.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Je-dun has been laboring in northern Fukien recently.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Bi-yin has gone to eastern Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Chun-geng is again visiting the brothers in Yu-Si.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Jai-seng has returned to Han River.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sister Shu-min is carrying out a two-week edifying meeting for the women here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Soon she will go to Fu-Ching and then to southern Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Chiu's whole household is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers Shih and Kwang-hwa continue their business as usual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brother Tien-yiang got married at Pu-Tien last month, and now he works at Shieho Hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sister Soon Shi-jiang, having left Chai-Jing, has decided to wholeheartedly serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Presently, she is staying temporarily at Brother Wilson Wang's house; her future has yet to be determined.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sister Peace Lu has left Kutien Hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She is also waiting for the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sister Li Shiu-yi has rendered much help to the work in the gospel hall.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I will write about the rest at a later time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May peace be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A weak one in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Chen Jeng-fan</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>November 9</S>
