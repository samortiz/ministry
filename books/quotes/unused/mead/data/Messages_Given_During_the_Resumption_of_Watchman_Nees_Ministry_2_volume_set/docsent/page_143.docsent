   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Simple and Strong in Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Natural naivety and spiritual simplicity are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The more a person knows the Lord, the simpler he is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But human methods always lend themselves to further complications.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A fleshly person does not have much within him, and what he has outwardly is more than what he has inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a person does not have anything inside him, but tries to assume something on the outside, he is deceiving himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither a capable mind nor a strong emotion is of any use.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only kind of person who is of use is one with a weighty and strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A man's head occupies one-seventh of the length of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If his head took up one-third of his body, he would look ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people have a good mind, but if their mind is too strong, they will look ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, if such a one matches his strong mind with a strong spirit, he will not look ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most outstanding part of a person is his nose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a man bumps into a wall or a door, the first thing that hits it is his nose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most outstanding part of our being ought to be our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need a large spirit, a strong spirit, a spirit that has been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have this kind of spirit, when others meet us, they will meet our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If what others touch is only our knowledge or our disposition, we are completely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>COORDINATION AMONG THE CO-WORKERS By the Authority of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Witness Lee asked: Is the coordination among the co-workers based on the ministers in the Body only, or is it based on some other things?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Nee answered: Yes, there are other things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the coordination there is also the question of arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, coordination is based on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Acts of the Apostles can also be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason it can be called the Acts of the Holy Spirit is that the Spirit has the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit is like the nerves in the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is true that the Body is under the direction of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the Head rules the Body through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, the practical outworking of authority lies in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord is directing His Body through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Authority is not a thing; the Lord did not give Peter a bundle of authority and ask him to come back for more when he used up that bundle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Authority is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The authority that was manifested in Paul, John, and Peter was something given by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Holy Spirit coordinated these men together in different places.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The question of authority is a question of being one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The principle underlying authority is the oneness with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Scriptures clearly state that the work that went out from Antioch was initiated by the commissioning of the Holy Spirit Acts 13:2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only those chosen by the Holy Spirit have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The individual work of a worker before the Lord is based on his ministry in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the overall operation in the Lord's work is based on the Holy Spirit.</S>
