   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE IN CHRIST MADE FULL, CIRCUMCISED,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RAISED, AND MADE ALIVE TOGETHER WITH HIM Scripture Reading: Col 2:8-15</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Colossians 2:8-15 forms a complete section of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This section begins with a word of warning: Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit v. 8 . This section is also followed by another warning: Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths v. 16 . The warning in verse 8 is based on the verses which precede it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to these verses, Christ is the mystery of God, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 6 Paul says that as we have received Christ, we should walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to walk in Christ, we must fulfill the two conditions mentioned in verse 7: we must be rooted in Him and be in the process of being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we must beware that no one carries us off as spoil from the very Christ who is the mystery of God and in whom we should walk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have received the wonderful Christ who is the mystery of God with all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now, having been rooted in Him and being built up in Him, we should walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A DESCRIPTION OF THE SOIL</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The section of Colossians which includes 2:8-15 is rather complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It contains a number of important points.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of these points are related to Christ as the good land, as the rich soil in which we have been rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The expression having been rooted in verse 7 implies that there is soil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 8 through 15 are a full description of Christ as the soil in which we have been rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Having been rooted in the soil, we grow with the elements we absorb from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We know that Christ as the soil is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we must go on to see, from verses 8 through 15, a description of the very soil in which we have been rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These verses present a full description and definition of the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first aspect of this very special soil is found in verse 9: For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have been rooted in the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not allow anyone to carry us away from such a soil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be carried away from this soil is to be uprooted from it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the book of Colossians was written, some were trying to uproot the believers from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The believers had been rooted in Christ as the good land, as the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead of allowing anyone to carry us away from this soil, we must stay rooted in it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 2:10 Paul continues, And you in Him are made full, Who is the Head of all rule and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here we see more concerning the substance of Christ as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One aspect of the soil is that of the fullness of the Godhead; another aspect is that Christ is the Head of all rule and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Christ as the good land we have a number of different elements.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first element is all the fullness of the Godhead, and the second is the Head of all rule and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verses 11 through 15 we find more elements.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 11 says, In Whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The soil also includes the circumcision of Christ, which denotes cutting and killing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the soil there is, therefore, a killing element.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 12, which says that we were buried together with Christ in baptism, indicates that the soil also contains the element of burial.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Christ as the soil there is a substance which causes us to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After burial, we are raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 12 Paul speaks of God who raised Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This expression indicates that in Christ as the soil there is an element which causes us to be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to verse 13, we also are made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is an element in the soil which gives us life, enlivens us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 1 Corinthians 15:45 Paul speaks of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Colossians 2:13 he uses the same Greek term for life-giving, only in the past tense.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the soil, Christ has made us alive; He has given us life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verses 14 and 15 Paul continues, Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here we have more elements that are found in Christ as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The wiping out of the handwriting in ordinances is an element in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The same is true of the stripping off of the rulers and the authorities, the making of a display of them openly, and the triumphing over them in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the soil, Christ includes all these marvelous elements.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise Him that He is such a rich soil!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have been rooted in this soil.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Day by day, our roots need to sink deeper into Christ as the unique soil.</S>
