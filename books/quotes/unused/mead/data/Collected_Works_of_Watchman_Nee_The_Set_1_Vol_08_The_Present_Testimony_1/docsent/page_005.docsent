   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It must first be bound on earth before heaven will bind.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It must be loosed on earth before heaven will loose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God will not do anything against His will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It does not mean that when something is bound on earth God will be forced to bind what He does not want to bind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God in heaven is binding what has been bound on earth because He has already intended to bind what has been bound first on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is waiting all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When His people on earth bind what He in heaven intends to bind, He will follow their command and bind according to their requests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fact that God is willing to follow His people's command to bind what they are binding shows that it has been God's will all along which is eternal to have such things bound.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then why will God not bind such things sooner?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since it is His will to bind and since His will is eternal, why will He not bind what should have been bound long ago according to His will?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why does He have to wait until they are bound on earth before He will bind in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Does it mean that He will not bind in heaven if it has not been bound on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Does it mean that when the binding on earth is delayed He will also delay the binding in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why is it that what God has desired to bind for a long time will only be bound when it is bound on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a believer can answer these questions, he will become more useful in the hands of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know that God created man for the purpose that man would become one with Him to destroy Satan and his works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man has a free will, and God's intention is that man would will to join his will to God to oppose the will of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the purpose of creation; it is also the purpose of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The life of the Lord Jesus demonstrates this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although we do not know the reason, we know that God would not act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God's people would not sympathize with Him, if they would not subject their wills, and if they would not express their oneness with God in their prayer, God would rather delay and sit back, than do anything alone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has shown great honor to His people to allow them to work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although He is omnipotent, He loves to be restricted by His children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although He is zealous for His own will, He would rather allow Satan's evil plots to run rampant, if His people neglect His will and do not sympathize with Him or work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If God's children will not be as cold as they are now, and if they will be willing to stop themselves, to submit to God's will, to care for God's glory, and to keep His word more, God's eternal purpose concerning what He intends to accomplish in this age will be fulfilled much sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church also would not be in so much confusion, sinners would not be so stubborn, the Lord Jesus would return sooner, the kingdom of heaven would descend sooner, Satan and his hosts would be cast into the abyss sooner, and the knowledge of Jehovah would spread over the earth sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is because believers care too much for themselves and do not work with God that so many enemies and so much lawlessness remain unbound, and so many sinners and so much grace are not loosed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Oh, heaven has been too restricted by men on earth!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers, God has entrusted so much to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do we trust in God in the same way?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How do we bind what God intends to bind?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How do we loose what God intends to loose?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord's answer is to ask "in harmony."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the meaning of prayer, and this is the prayer of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The highest point of our working together with God is to ask in one accord for God to accomplish what He intends to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The true meaning of prayer is for the praying one to seek for the accomplishment of the will of the One to whom he prays.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Prayer is an indication that we want God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is to say that our will is standing on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without this kind of prayer, there is no real prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How many prayers today are for the expression of God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How many prayers are a setting aside of oneself and a seeking for the accomplishment of God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How many believers are there who truly work together with God in prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How many believers echo back to God His heart's desire daily before Him and empty out their hearts to seek after God and to ask for God to accomplish what they understand as God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Let us realize that a selfish heart is no less prominent in prayer than in other things!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How many of our own requests are standing in the way!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How numerous are our own wills, our own desires, our own plans, and our own cravings!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With so many things of our own, it is difficult to expect that we can forget about ourselves completely in prayer and seek after God's will alone.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One should, of course, deny the self in everything, and to deny the self in prayer is as important as to deny the self in our walk.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should know that as saved ones we should live unto the Lord who died and resurrected for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we should henceforth live completely unto Him, not reserving anything for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Among all the things in our life of consecration, prayer should also be one consecrated item.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One great and common error in our thoughts is to consider that prayer is an expression of our needs and that prayer is but our cry to God for help.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Little do we realize that prayer is to ask God to fulfill His need.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to realize that God's intention is not for the believers to accomplish their will through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God's intention is to accomplish His own will through the believers' prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This does not mean that believers should not ask God to fulfill their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It only means that believers should first understand the meaning and principle of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every time believers have a lack, they should first ask whether or not such a lack will affect God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Is it God who ordains that they have such a lack?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Or is it God's will that they be supplied?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only after one has seen that it is God's will that his needs be met, should he pray for God to accomplish His will with regards to meeting his need .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only after one has understood God's will, should he pray for the will of God which he has understood and ask that God's will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The question now is not whether or not you have a lack or that you need to be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The question now is whether or not God's will is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although your prayer may be the same as before, your attention is turned to the accomplishment of God's will in such matters and not to the fulfilling of your own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Here lies the failure of many.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Believers think that their own needs are the priority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even after they have understood that God's will is to supply their need, they still pray tenaciously for their own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should never pray for our own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is only one legitimate prayer in the whole universe only one prayer that pleases God the prayer that asks for the accomplishment of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our needs must be lost in God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whenever we see God's will concerning our need, we have to drop our need immediately to seek after the accomplishment of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A direct prayer for the fulfilling of needs whatever kind of need it may be is never the noblest prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All prayers for personal needs should only be made indirectly while one is seeking for the accomplishment of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the secret to prayer, and this is the secret to victory in prayer.</S>
