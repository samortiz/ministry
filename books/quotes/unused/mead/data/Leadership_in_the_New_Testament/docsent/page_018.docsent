   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LEADERSHIP IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament leadership comprises the elders in the church and those who take the lead in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not right to say that there is no leadership in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even in the proper family life there is a leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the parents are away from home, the oldest brother or sister is left as a leader for the other children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If both the parents and the older children are away, a baby-sitter is left with the remaining children to be a leader for them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In every situation there is the need for a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the church life the elders take the lead diligently Heb 13:24; Rom 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the elders are the leading ones in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without leaders we could not have an orderly church life with so many arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, we would have confusion in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The leadership in the church life is carried out by the elders' laboring in teaching the saints 1 Tim 5:17; 3:2 and their shepherding the church as the flock of God, overseeing it according to God, and becoming patterns of the flock, not lording it over the flock 1 Pet 5:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The leaders in the church must take the lead in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They must be the leading sheep, the head sheep, in the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the sheep at the head of the flock move, the rest of the sheep follow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, when the sheep in the front do nothing, the whole flock stops.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the rest rooms in the meeting hall need to be cleaned, the elders should take the lead to clean them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders should also be the first ones to go out to visit people for the gospel by knocking on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the elders go out to preach the gospel, many in the church will follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If, on the other hand, the elders do not take the lead to go out, but simply exhort the other saints to do it, not many of the saints will go.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way to be an elder is not to command others but to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the elders labor in teaching and if they shepherd, oversee, and are patterns of the flock, all the saints will respect and obey them as leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The elders should be regarded, obeyed, and honored by the saints 1 Thes 5:12-13; Heb 13:17; 1 Tim 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The honor given to the elders may include material supply.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some elders do not take a job for their living because they are too busy in the matters of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They do not have an income; they live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The saints should honor them by giving them some material supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the proper order with a proper, beautiful situation in the church life.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>New Testament Ministry among the Gentiles</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The New Testament leadership also comprises the leadership in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Peter took the lead in the New Testament ministry among the Jews Gal 2:7b .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can see Peter's lead in the ministry in the first twelve chapters of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul took the lead in the New Testament ministry among the Gentiles Gal 2:7a; Rom 11:13 in the last sixteen chapters of Acts.</S>
