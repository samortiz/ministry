   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT ALL SPEAK IN TONGUES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 30 Paul says, "Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul's question about speaking in tongues is a problem to those in the Pentecostal movement or charismatic movement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1936 I first became involved with tongues speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I took the lead to speak in tongues and I taught about two hundred others to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time I was endeavoring to have everyone speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who could not do so were encouraged to imitate tongues speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Brother Nee heard the news about this, he sent me a cable containing one line: "Do all speak with tongues?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Pentecostal people say that there are two kinds of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first may be called the initial speaking which they say everyone must experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to them, the second is the function of speaking in tongues in a meeting, which only some experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What a ridiculous interpretation!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How could someone speak in tongues initially and not speak in tongues thereafter?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the Pentecostalists must interpret the Bible this way in order to avoid being caught by Paul's question in verse 30 regarding all speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am sorry that so many in today's Pentecostal movement and charismatic movement do not pay careful attention to Paul's words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we were in China, we attempted three times to bring the Pentecostal things into the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Each time we did so we suffered a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The debit far outweighed the credit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1943 we were suffering, and the church was low.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I had been imprisoned for a month, and after I came out of prison I contracted tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the church was depressed, some decided to bring in the Pentecostal things in order to stir up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One of the sisters became bold and prevailing in the matter of speaking in tongues, and she caused the meetings to be focused on herself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At first the elders thought that this was good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, they later sensed that things were not normal and they began to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day a young sister among us died.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sister who was prevailing in speaking in tongues prophesied that the deceased sister would be resurrected the next day at twelve o'clock noon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In her prophecy she told that sister's husband to make no arrangements for the funeral.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The news of that prophecy stirred the whole church, and many gathered together to witness the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before noon the sister who had uttered the prophecy and two helpers knelt down and prayed loudly and boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They seemed to be quite living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Twelve o'clock came.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We waited until three o'clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Still nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Finally, the oldest elder stood up and said, "Brothers and sisters, we should not listen to any more nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us make the arrangements to bury our sister."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That was the end of the Pentecostal movement among us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although no conference of the workers was held regarding it and no decision was made, spontaneously everyone dropped it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After that, the entire church came back to the regular church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me now tell you something I experienced on the West Coast in 1963.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was invited to speak to a certain group in San Diego, and I stayed in the home of the leader for several days.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At least four others were with me, all staying in the same home.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In one of the meetings of this group a certain lady spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to my impression, that was not a genuine tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After this lady spoke in tongues, a young man gave forth what purported to be the interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, I could tell that his interpretation was not genuine, for it was three times longer than the so-called message in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At home after the meeting I said to our host, "Brother, do you believe that the interpretation given in the meeting was genuine?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He admitted that it was not.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I said, "Brother, why do we need to practice such things?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have a wonderful Christ, and we do not have enough time to minister the riches of Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why should we waste our time with nonsensical and false things?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Realizing what my attitude was, he became somewhat afraid of me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A few nights later, after I had gone to bed, he and his wife began to work on one of our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The host laid hands on the brother, and the wife told him to open his mouth and say something, but not to speak either English or Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Realizing that he had to speak something or else they would not let him go, he uttered a few sounds of Indonesian that he had learned from his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The host and his wife were elated, rejoicing that the brother had spoken in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I awoke in the morning, I heard what had taken place the night before.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the breakfast table I said to the host, "Brother, do you realize that you were fooled last night?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Your wife told the brother to speak neither English nor Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This forced him to speak nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You were happy, thinking that he had spoken in tongues."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They could not deny the situation.</S>
