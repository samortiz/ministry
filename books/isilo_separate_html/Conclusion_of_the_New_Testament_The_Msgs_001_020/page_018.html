The Head of Christ</h2><p>First Corinthians 11:3 says, &#8220;I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.&#8221; Christ is God&#8217;s anointed One, appointed by God. Hence, He is under God, and God as the Originator is His Head. This refers to the relationship between Christ and God in the divine government. In the universe, especially in God&#8217;s governmental administration, there is order. God is the Head over Christ, Christ is the Head over every man, and man is the head over the woman.<h2 class=head2>10. The Savior of All</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 1:1 Paul says, &#8220;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope.&#8221; God our Savior (1 Tim. 4:10; Titus 2:13) and our Savior God (1 Tim. 2:3; Titus 1:3; 2:10; 3:4) are titles particularly ascribed to God in the three books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, books that take God&#8217;s salvation as a strong base for the teachings concerning God&#8217;s New Testament economy (1 Tim. 1:15-16; 2:4-6; 2 Tim. 1:9-10; 2:10; 3:15; Titus 2:14; 3:5-7). It was according to the command of such a saving God, a Savior God, not according to the command of the law-giving God, a demanding God, that Paul became an apostle.<p>First Timothy 2:3 says, &#8220;This is good and acceptable in the sight of our Savior God.&#8221; In 1 Timothy Paul emphasizes the Savior God. Hence, in this verse he speaks not of the God of grace nor of the God of mercy, but of the Savior God, the God who saves us. In 1 Timothy 4:10 Paul goes on to speak of &#8220;the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.&#8221;<p>In Titus 1:3 Paul again speaks of &#8220;the command of our Savior God.&#8221; Then in Titus 2:10 he speaks concerning &#8220;the teachings of our Savior God.&#8221; Our Savior is not only Christ, but God Triune embodied in Christ, as indicated in Titus 2:13. Our Savior God desires not only to save us, but also to teach us the full knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 2:4). Hence, there is the teaching of our Savior God, which may be adorned, beautified, by the transformed character of the most vile persons saved by His grace.<p>In Titus 3:4 Paul tells us that &#8220;the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared.&#8221; It is the kindness and love of our Savior God that has saved us and made us different from others.<p>Jude 25 also speaks of God our Savior: &#8220;To the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority before all time, and now, and unto all eternity. Amen.&#8221; Here we see that the only God is our Savior. To such a Savior may there be glory, majesty, might, and authority throughout all ages. Glory is the expression and splendor; majesty, the greatness in honor; might, the strength in power; and authority, the power in ruling.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
