<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Issuing In Jehovah's Restoration</H2><P>Jehovah's punishment of Ephraim issued in His restoration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jehovah Becoming a Crown<br>of Glory and a Diadem of Beauty</H2><P>In the day of restoration, Jehovah will become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the remnant of His people (v. 5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah Becoming a Spirit of Justice</H2><P>Jehovah will become a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment and strength to those who turn away the battle at the gate (v. 6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Ushering In the Trustworthy Christ</H2><P>Jehovah's punishment over Ephraim's drunkards will also usher in the trustworthy Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. A Stone Laid by the Lord Jehovah in Zion</H2><P>The trustworthy Christ is a stone laid by the Lord Jehovah in Zion as a foundation, a tested stone. Because Christ has been tested, He can be a foundation (v. 16a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. A Precious Cornerstone</H2><P>The trustworthy Christ is also a precious cornerstone as a foundation firmly established (v. 16b). In Matthew 21:42 the Lord Jesus refers to Himself as the cornerstone. Furthermore, both Paul and Peter speak of Christ as a cornerstone. In Ephesians 2:20 Paul says that in building up the two parts of God's building, the Jews and the Gentiles, Christ Jesus Himself is the cornerstone. In Acts 4:11 Peter says, "This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone." Later, in his first Epistle, Peter says, "To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor" (2:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The One Believing Not Hastening Away</H2><P>Isaiah 28:16c says that he who believes will not hasten away.</P>
