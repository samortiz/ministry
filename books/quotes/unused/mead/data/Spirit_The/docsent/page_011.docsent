   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this message we want to see fourteen symbols of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These fourteen symbols can be divided into seven pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first pair is the brooding bird and the dove.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The second pair is the olive oil and the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The third pair is the wind and the breath.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is interesting to note that both the Old Testament and the New Testament begin with the Spirit as a bird and end with the Spirit as water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Old Testament, Genesis 1:2 says that the Spirit of God was brooding as a bird upon or over the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Testament, Matthew 3:16b and John 1:32 show us that the Spirit is as a dove.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>47:1, 5, 7-9, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These symbols are concerning the water.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then the last symbol of the Spirit in the New Testament is the river of water of life Rev 22:1, 17b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE BROODING BIRD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Genesis 1:2 says, The Spirit of God was brooding upon the face of the waters Gen 1:2 ASV note .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brooding is for bringing something into life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Genesis 1 the Spirit of God was brooding over the death waters to produce something of life out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The brooding of the Spirit brought in light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without light, there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After light was brought in, the plant life came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Following this was the animal life with the birds, the fish, the cattle, and the creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, the human life was created.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the tree of life, denoting the divine life, the highest life, was presented to the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of these different kinds of life came out of the brooding of the Spirit as the divine bird.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The brooding of the Spirit brought forth life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the basic principle of the move of the Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before we heard the gospel, we were dead just like the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then the Spirit of God came to brood over us, and that brooding produced life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The thought of the Lord as a brooding bird is also expressed in Deuteronomy 32:11 and Isaiah 31:5.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever the God of life comes to the ones in death, He comes as a brooding bird.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He comes to brood over them to produce life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE DOVE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In John 1:29, John the Baptist said, Behold, the Lamb of God.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE OLIVE OIL</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The olive oil is another symbol of the Spirit Psa 45:7; Heb 1:9; Isa 61:1; Zech 4:6, 11, 14 Darby .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Psalm 45:7 says, God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The oil of gladness is the Spirit of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God has anointed Christ with the oil of gladness, the Spirit of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now we need to ask how we know that the olive oil symbolizes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We know this by comparing Isaiah 61:1 with Hebrews 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Isaiah 61:1 says, The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah has anointed me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hebrews 1:9 says that God has anointed Christ with the oil of exultant joy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Spirit with which Christ was anointed in Isaiah 61:1 is the oil of exultant joy in Hebrews 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This proves that the oil is the anointing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Zechariah is a wonderful book concerning Christ with His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Zechariah 4 shows us the two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left v. 11 . The work of the lampstand is to shine with light, but for the lampstand to shine, it needs the olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Without the olive oil, the lampstand stops working.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today it is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Revelation 1 tells us that the churches are the lampstands.</S>

   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For the churches to shine forth light, there is the need of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Zechariah 4:6 says, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The two olive trees on the right and on the left of the lampstand are full of oil v. 12 , full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Zechariah 4:14 tells us that the two olive trees are the two sons of oil Darby .</S>
