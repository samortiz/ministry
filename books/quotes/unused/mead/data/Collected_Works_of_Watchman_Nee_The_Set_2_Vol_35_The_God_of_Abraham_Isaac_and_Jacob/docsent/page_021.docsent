   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Grace and the Law</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abraham married Hagar and begot Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Galatians 4 says that "the one of the maidservant was born according to the flesh...from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children unto slavery, which is Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now this Hagar is Sinai the mountain in Arabia..." vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, Hagar represents the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the law?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law represents God's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Ten Commandments represent God's demands on man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God wants this and He wants that.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does it mean to keep the law?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Keeping the law means giving something to God and pleasing God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But Galatians 3:10 says, "Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things written in the book of the law to do them."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, those who say, "I will please God," are cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why are they cursed?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is because man cannot please God by himself, and he is not qualified to please God Rom 8:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Bible the law is frequently mentioned in conjunction with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 7 is a chapter particularly on the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is also a chapter particularly on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Simply put, the flesh is self-effort; the flesh is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we try to keep the law, we are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever man tries to please God by his own effort, the law comes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A person who tries to please God with the fleshly strength is one with whom God is not pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what Hagar and Ishmael represent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hagar represents the law, while Ishmael represents the resulting flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Abraham was a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He tried to please God and fulfill God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God wanted him to have a son, and he tried to have a son by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Was this not according to God's will, and did he not do it to please God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Could it be wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, Paul said, "The one of the maidservant was born according to the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is true that God's will should be done.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the question is who should be the one to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we try to do His will by ourselves, the result is Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Abraham was wrong, not in his goal but in his source.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His goal was to see God's promise being fulfilled, but he was wrong to fulfill it by his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only will God reject those who do things that are not pleasing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will reject even those who do things that are pleasing to Him, but who do them according to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We will not please God if we sin, and neither will we please God if we try to do good by our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether or not we please God depends on whether the cross has done its work in dealing with our flesh and the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are we saying, "God, I cannot do anything, and I am not qualified to do anything; I can only look to You"?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A person who truly believes in God is one who does not act according to his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is the Master of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The thing that offends God the most is usurping His place in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is often where our mistake lies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot believe, we cannot trust, and we cannot wait.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We cannot commit everything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the root of our offense against God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God ordained that Abraham would beget a son through Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Galatians 4:23 tells us that "the one of the free woman was born through promise."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The free woman was Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hagar represents the law, while Sarah represents grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the difference between law and grace?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Doing things by ourselves is law, while grace is God doing things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Simply put, grace is God doing everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are doing it, it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only when God is doing it for us is it grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Grace, as defined in the Bible, is not forbearance or tolerance, nor is it doing anything by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is something specific that God does in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The specific work God wanted to do in Abraham was begetting Isaac through Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Isaac was to be begotten of Abraham, but he was to be begotten through grace and through God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No Life without Death</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Genesis 16 says that Abraham begot Ishmael when he was eighty-six years old.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At that time his fleshly energy and natural strength still existed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is why Galatians 4 says that Ishmael was born of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Genesis 21 tells us that by the time Abraham begot Isaac, he was already a hundred years old v. 5 . Romans 4 tells us that when he was about a hundred years old, Abraham considered his own body as already dead and Sarah's womb as being deadened v. 19 . In other words, his fleshly energy and natural strength were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Abraham did not have any more strength to beget a son, and neither did Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God chose this time for Isaac to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This means that God wanted Abraham to consider himself as a dying, and even dead, person so that he could trust in the God who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's intention was for Abraham to realize that he was not the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is very interesting that God wanted him to be a father, yet at the same time, He wanted him to see that he was not the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He waited until all the natural energy of Abraham was gone before He gave him Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the kind of work that God wants to perform in us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is always waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even if it means waiting for fourteen years, He will still wait.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is waiting for the day when we realize that we cannot make it, and when we see ourselves as good as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then we will beget Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He cannot use us today because our time has not come.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God is after not only the accomplishment of His will, but an accomplishment that issues from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we only have doctrines and knowledge and have never been brought to the point where we tell Him, "I am through, I am dead, and I cannot make it," He cannot use us, and we cannot beget Isaac or fulfill His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>One very important condition for begetting Isaac is the matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord cannot really use us and we cannot really manifest Christ or uphold God's testimony on earth until we are a hundred years old.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the time when everything about us is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Before that day arrives, every work that we do by ourselves is Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The question now is whether we want Ishmael or Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is easy to beget Ishmael; if we are like Hagar, we can beget Ishmael at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is easy to do things through Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we are like Hagar, there is no need for us to wait, but if we would be like Sarah, there is a need for us to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In begetting Ishmael, one does not need to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But in order to beget Isaac, there is the need of waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>One has to wait for God's promise, for His timing, and for Him to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Those who cannot wait for God to work, who will not allow God to work, and who do not have God working for them will stretch out their own hands to seize Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Those who want to have Isaac must wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The day will come when we cannot do anything by ourselves, when we are not able to do anything, are not capable of anything, and are completely through in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>That will be the day when Christ will be fully manifested in us and God's goal will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Before that time, everything that we do by ourselves will have no spiritual value; rather, it will be harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In spiritual work it is not a matter of how much we do, but a matter of how much we have gained of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In spiritual matters, God's work and man's work are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There is a vast difference between the value of God's work and the value of man's work.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Only that which comes out of Him has any spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Anything that does not come out of Him has no spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>What then is Ishmael?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Ishmael is anything born prematurely.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is doing things by oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We can say that Ishmael includes two characteristics: the first is a wrong source, and the second is a premature timing.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In spiritual things nothing tests us more than the matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It often does not take much for our flesh to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>All that God needs to do is put us aside for three months, and our flesh will not be able to stand it.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>But God will never be pleased to see an Ishmael before His time.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Even if we can say a few words or do a few things, and even if these things appear to be of God, He will not be pleased with them.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>God's goal must be achieved according to God's time and through God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is the principle of Isaac a principle of God's time and God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Abraham Being Justified Once Again</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Romans 4:19-22 says, "And not weakening in his faith, he considered his own body as already dead, being about a hundred years old, as well as the deadening of Sarah's womb; but with regard to the promise of God, he did not doubt in unbelief, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what He had promised He was able also to do.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Therefore also it was accounted to him as righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We should note that Abraham's justification by faith in these verses is different in time from that spoken of in Romans 4:3, which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This is Paul's quotation of Genesis 15:6.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>It refers to the time before Abraham was eighty-five years old.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>At that time God spoke to Abraham in a vision: "He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>God also brought Abraham forth abroad and asked him to look toward heaven and number the stars and said to him, "So shall thy seed be."</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Abraham believed in God, and God counted it to him for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>This was the first justification.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Although Abraham believed, his faith was not perfect, and later he begot Ishmael by his own flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The words "it was accounted to him as righteousness" in Romans 4:22 refer to the incident in Genesis 17.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>At that time he was ninety-nine years old.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Although he considered his own body as being already dead and his wife's womb as being deadened, he did not doubt in unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>He fully believed that God would fulfill what He had promised.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>This was accounted to him as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Hence, this was a further justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>There was a time lapse of over ten years, but God was still teaching Abraham the same lesson the lesson of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>At the beginning, there was Abraham's own element in his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>After many years he had entirely lost hope in himself, but he was still able to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>God counted him as righteous based on his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>God had brought him to the point where he truly believed.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>This was the result of God's work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>This shows us that it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy Rom 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>He is the One who initiates the work, and He is the One who carries out the work.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>May He help us learn the lesson of faith, and may we look to Him alone!</S>
