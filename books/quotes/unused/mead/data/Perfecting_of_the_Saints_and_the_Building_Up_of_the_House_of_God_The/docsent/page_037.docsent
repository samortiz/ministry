   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT PERSONAL SPIRITUALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT THE BUILDING UP OF GOD S HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, I am burdened to show the saints that those who serve the Lord should not focus only on spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we focus only on being spiritual, eventually we will not be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not a matter of whether we are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The issue is whether we let God open our eyes to see a vision and whether we receive a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we focus on our spirituality and learning instead of receiving a vision, burden, and revelation from God, we will eventually fall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s revelation, vision, and burden are great.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They can uphold us and make us stand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then even if we stumble, we will not fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The apostle Paul said that he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision Acts 26:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This vision followed him and continually upheld him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are caught in the trap of being spiritual, we will have a tragic end and become useless to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such spirituality is manufactured and does not necessarily have its source in God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not learn to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can read The Spiritual Man ten thousand times but not become spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A person who pursues God and enjoys God will be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only God can make a person spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, if we are in God, in His hand, plan, and move, we do not need to pursue spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We cannot make ourselves spiritual; only God can make us spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have been considering what being spiritual means.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My understanding of spirituality is different from what it was in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What we thought was spirituality is not spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Genuine spirituality depends on our learning to receive God s burden.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hudson Taylor received a burden that was different from his spiritual learning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he had been zealous for the gospel, like Billy Graham or John Sung, it would not be strange that he received a burden to evangelize China.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, Hudson Taylor was not such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He learned to live in the presence of God and to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He then received a burden that differed from what he had learned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was neither trapped nor limited by his learning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>KNOWING ONLY TO WORK AND TO HELP OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I usually do not expect a result in whatever I do, nor do I care for the result.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I know only to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I also do not hold many opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This characteristic was recognized by the senior co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do not wish to speak about myself, but I want to fellowship with you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever there was a crucial matter to be decided, the senior workers would first fellowship with others before they fellowshipped with me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When it was time to carry something out, they fellowshipped with me to ask me to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They would first fellowship with others to hear their opinions, then they fellowshipped with me to ask me to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They did this because I did not have many opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is one thing I can boast of.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am a person who knows only to work; I do not give opinions or care for results.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May the Lord cover me to testify that I do not covet anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the day I began to serve full time, I have not coveted anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I know only to immerse myself in the work, and I do not care who is credited with the result of my labor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, I find it difficult to make a plan and instruct others how to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not that I do not wish to take the lead but that I do not have many opinions or care for results.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I know only to work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Lord led me to northern China, I knew only to work hard and let go of any results.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I did not care about any gain or loss.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the Lord led me to Shanghai, for about three years I knew only to immerse myself in the work and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I was still working the day before I boarded an airplane to come to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I did not know what would be the result of my labor, because the result was not in my hand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I say this so that no one will depend on me to push them or to make plans and arrangements for them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, there are still things that I need to learn, but on the other hand, for the past seven or eight years I have tried my best to help the brothers in Taiwan serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I did not express any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I knew only to work and help others to work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I never had the thought of controlling anyone or lording it over anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not care for this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I know only to take care of my responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This has always been my practice.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brother Sparks once testified concerning me and said that Brother Lee does not know anything but to work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This comment may be too much, but it is true that I know only to work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In my relationship with the saints I try my best to assist, encourage, and admonish without assuming a position.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, I hope that we can learn to be before the Lord and coordinate for the building, instead of waiting for someone to motivate us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We also need to see that coordination for the building is the secret to being blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I thank the Lord for His mercy that I have not had problems with any workers in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is especially true in regard to coordination with the senior workers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I learned that the good points, faults, strengths, and weaknesses of the saints are not my business.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I do not work with the saints because of their strengths or weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I work with them for the Lord s interest, testimony, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As long as the Lord s interest, testimony, and glory are not hindered or damaged, I will coordinate with the saints by complementing what they can do.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I will not step on them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to learn to work in this way and not oppose or step on others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Everyone s work has its place and its value.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should learn to work with others by adding our portion to theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The workers should learn to serve in this way before the Lord.</S>
