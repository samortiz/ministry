   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second item of our enjoyment in eternity is the tree of life 22:14, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The tree of life is nothing less than Christ, the Son of God, the redeeming Lamb, as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This tree is rich, fresh, and refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have been redeemed that we may have the right to come to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 22:14 says, Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse may be considered a promise for the enjoyment of the tree of life, which is Christ with all the riches of life; and the second half of verse 17 may be considered a call to take the water of life, which is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, the book of Revelation ends in a promise and a call, both of which are for eating the all-inclusive Christ and drinking Him as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After his creation, man was put before the tree of life Gen 2:8-9 , indicating that he was privileged to partake of it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But due to the fall of man, the tree of life was closed to man by God s glory, holiness, and righteousness Gen 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through Christ s redemption, which has fulfilled all the requirements of God s glory, holiness, and righteousness, the way to the tree of life is opened again to believers Heb 10:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the believers who wash their robes in the redeeming blood of Christ have the right to enjoy the tree of life as their eternal portion in the holy city, the paradise of God in eternity 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this verse, robes symbolize the conduct of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To wash our robes is to keep our conduct clean through the washing of the blood of the Lamb 7:14; 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This gives us the right to participate in the tree of life and to enter into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To enter in by the gates into the city is to enter into the New Jerusalem as a realm of God s eternal blessing by regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-imparting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both the tree of life and the city will be our enjoyment in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE WATER OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Another aspect of the enjoyment and blessing of God s redeemed in eternity is the water of life 22:17; 21:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The water of life is the life-giving Spirit as our eternal drink.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need both to eat and to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not so pleasant to eat without having anything to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hallelujah, in eternity we shall have food, the tree of life, and drink, the life-giving Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Remember, the life-giving Spirit is actually the Triune God Himself flowing Himself out to be our drink.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because many Christians hold a mistaken concept derived from traditional teachings, they think that the Spirit is separate from the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To them, the Spirit is merely the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But John 15:26 says, But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me. The sense of the Greek preposition translated from is from with.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit of reality is sent by the Son not only from the Father, but also with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the Comforter comes from the Father and with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Father is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Spirit comes from the source, He does not leave the source; the source comes with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit comes from the Father, and the Father comes with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This Spirit, sent by the Son and coming with the Father, testifies concerning the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, His testimony concerning the Son is a matter of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although this is difficult to explain, it is easy to understand if we consider our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we call, O Lord Jesus, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when the Spirit comes, we have the deep sense that the Father and the Son have also come.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that this Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When He comes into us, He comes with the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, our eternal drink, the life-giving Spirit, is nothing less than the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What an enjoyment this is!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we devote our attention to mere doctrinal understanding, we shall miss this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we care for the genuine experience in our spirit, we shall say, Now I understand that the very drink I enjoy is the Triune God flowing into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This eternal drink is bright as crystal 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the life-giving Spirit there is nothing opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we drink of this eternal Spirit, everything becomes crystal clear.</S>
