   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CONSECRATED PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us look at Exodus 28:1-2 and 29:1, 4, 9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After reading these verses, we can see that consecration is a very special matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The nation of Israel was a nation chosen by God Exo 19:5-6 , but it did not become a consecrated nation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There were twelve tribes among the Israelites, but not all the twelve tribes received the holy service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The tribe of Levi was one of the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were a tribe chosen by God Num 3:11-13 , but they were not a consecrated tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among the many Levites, only the household of Aaron received the holy service.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not all of the Israelites received the holy service, not even all of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only the household of Aaron received the holy service.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to be consecrated, one had to belong to this household.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If one were not a member of this household, he could not consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the members of this household the household of Aaron were qualified to be priests, and only they could consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank God, today we are the members of this household.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who believe in the Lord are the members of this household.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All who have been saved by grace are priests Rev 1:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has chosen us to be the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Initially, only the members of Aaron's household could consecrate themselves; if anyone else came near, he would have been put to death Num 18:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must remember that only those chosen by God to be priests can consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, only the members of this household could consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today God has chosen us to be the priests; therefore, we are the members of this household.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we are qualified to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here we see that man does not consecrate himself because he has chosen God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, God is the One who chooses and calls, and then man consecrates himself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who consider that they are doing God a favor by forsaking all are but outsiders; they are not consecrated at all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must realize that our service to God is not a favor or courtesy to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not a matter of offering ourselves to God's work, but a matter of God being gracious to us and giving us a portion of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is God who has given us the glory and the beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible tells us that the holy garment of the priest is for glory and beauty Exo 28:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consecration is God giving us glory and beauty; it is God calling us into His service.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we boast in anything at all, we must boast in our marvelous Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is nothing marvelous for the Lord to have servants like us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The marvelous thing is for us to have such a Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must see that consecration is the result of being chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Serving God is an honor to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not uplifting God, as if we were sacrificing anything for Him or as if we had any glory in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Consecration is God giving us the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should prostrate ourselves before Him and say, "Thank You that I can have a part in Your service.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are so many people in this world, yet I am chosen to have a part in it!"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consecration is our honor, not our sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is true that we need to have the greatest sacrifice, but there is no sense of sacrifice in consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is only the full sense of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE GOAL OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The goal of consecration is not to become a preacher for God or to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The goal of consecration is to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The result of consecration is service.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the original language the word service means "to wait upon."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that a person is prepared to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must remember that the goal of consecration is to wait upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Waiting upon someone may not be strenuous work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To wait upon God means that you stand when He wants you to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If He wants to shuffle you aside, you allow Him to shuffle you aside, and if He wants you to run, you run.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is what it means to wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God requires that all Christians offer up their bodies to wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This does not necessarily mean that He wants you to stand at the pulpit or evangelize some remote land.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It means to wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If God sends someone to the pulpit, that person has no choice but to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If God sends someone to remote lands, he has no choice but to go.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All our time is for God, but the work that we do is flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everyone should wait on God, but the specific work that one should engage in is flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must learn to wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The presenting of one's body is for serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As long as we are Christians, we have to serve God all our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As soon as a person consecrates himself, he must realize that from that point on, the Lord's requirement comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Service to God becomes one's lifelong mission.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May God be gracious to us and show us that our service to Him is our rightful duty.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should show every believer that henceforth we are those who serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must realize that as Christians, we can no longer be loose in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am not saying that we should not be faithful and committed to our career or that we can be idle.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is not what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We still need to be faithful and serious in our vocation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But before God we must see that our entire life is directed towards our service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We do everything for the purpose of obeying God's will and pleasing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the reality of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Consecration is not how much we can give to God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is being accepted by God and being granted the honor of serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Consecration is reserved for Christians alone; it is not for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only the saved ones, those who belong to the Lord, can consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Consecration means that we say, "Lord, You have given me the opportunity and the right to come before You and to serve You."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is saying, "Lord, I am Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>My ears were purchased by the blood; they belong to You.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>My hands were purchased by the blood; they belong to You.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>My feet were purchased by the blood; they belong to You.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>From now on I can no longer use them for myself."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We do not beg others to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Instead, we tell them that a way is now available for them to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There is a way to serve our God, the Lord of hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must be clear that we are here to serve the Lord of hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is grossly wrong to think that consecration is a matter of granting God a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The revelation in the Old Testament is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A man can only consecrate himself to God under His approval.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The New Testament also exhorts us to consecrate ourselves through the compassions of God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God loves us so much; therefore, we have to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is the most reasonable service.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is not a request for favor; this is the most reasonable thing, the most natural thing, to do.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Consecration does not depend upon our willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is because of God's abounding grace that we can consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must see that having the right to be God's servant is the greatest honor of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is a joyful thing for a man to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is a far more joyful thing for a man to have a part in God's service!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Who do we think our God is?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We have to see His greatness and His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Only then will we see the tremendous significance and honor of this service!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>What a tremendous thing it is for us to receive His grace and be counted worthy of serving Him!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>From Messages for Building Up New Believers, pp.</S>
