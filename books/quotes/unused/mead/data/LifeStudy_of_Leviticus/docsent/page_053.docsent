   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE ELEMENTS OF THE MEAL OFFERING FOR THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Lev 2:1-2, 4, 11, 13; Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20; Luke 3:21-22; 4:1; 23:14; Matt 12:46-50; Mark 10:38; John 12:24; 7:6, 16-18; Rom 8:2, 3, 6, 9-11, 13; 1 Cor 10:17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I am burdened to give a further word on the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, I am not burdened to speak on the meal offering merely in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, my burden is to fellowship with you concerning the elements, the components, of the meal offering in relation to the Christian life and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE SPIRIT OF REALITY BEING THE REALITY OF THE OFFERINGS TO US IN OUR EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the foregoing message we saw that the reality of all the offerings is Christ realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that in our experience the Spirit is the reality of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not have the Spirit in a subjective way, we will not have the reality of the offerings but only the doctrine regarding Christ as the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Himself, Christ is the reality of the offerings, but He cannot be this reality to us apart from His being the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE FIVE BASIC OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Leviticus there are five basic offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is difficult for us to say which of these five offerings is the main offering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may say that the peace offering is the main offering because, according to chapters one through five of Leviticus, it stands in the center.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Others may say that the main offering is the burnt offering, which signifies Christ as the One who is absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Still others may say that, since we have the problems of sin and sins in our daily life, either the sin offering or the trespass offering is the main offering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we need all the basic offerings, the main offering with respect to the experience of Christ in its many aspects and details is the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In understanding the book of Leviticus, we today are standing on the shoulders of many Bible teachers, especially those among the Brethren, who have gone before us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We surely must give credit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, because we are on their shoulders, we can see things which they have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One of these things is the matter of enjoying the offerings in order to be constituted to become a certain kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We become what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we eat Christ as the meal offering, we will be constituted with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to know the elements that compose the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to realize that the meal offering includes four elements but specifically excludes two other elements.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To know all these elements is to know Christ in a practical and detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>FINE FLOUR</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first element in the meal offering is the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This fine flour signifies Christ's humanity, which is balanced and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE OIL</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whereas the fine flour in the meal offering signifies humanity, the oil signifies divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The oil signifies God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fine flour is the base, and the oil is added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we read Leviticus 2 carefully, we will see that the oil is added to the flour in three ways.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The oil may be mingled with the flour, or it may be poured on the flour.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The flour may also be anointed with the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The most important way of adding the oil to the flour is mingling the flour with the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fine flour does not remain dry but is "oiled" both inwardly and outwardly.</S>
