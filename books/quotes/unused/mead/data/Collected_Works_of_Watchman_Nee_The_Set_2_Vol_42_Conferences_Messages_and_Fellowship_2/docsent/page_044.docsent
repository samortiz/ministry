   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF GOD'S REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR SEEING THE EVIL OF THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During the past two days, I have been considering one thing: God has to give us revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we do not have revelation from God to see His will, we will justify things according to our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We will consider that something is reasonable when we think that it is good and justified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a consequence, we often do not hate what God hates and cannot sympathize with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not despise such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have not dealt with this matter in a serious way before the Lord, we cannot engage ourselves in His work, because we are not qualified to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if we have done something, it will not be registered in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to ask God for a thorough and shattering revelation to see what He sees.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When our eyes are opened, we will see how evil are the Amalekites; we will not treasure even the best of the sheep, the oxen, or Agag.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will realize that everything that issues from the flesh is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we have not seen the evil of the goodness of the flesh, we have not yet seen God's revelation, and we are still not clear concerning what is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have listened to so many teachings and have learned so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may agree that the flesh should be removed, but the question is whether or not we truly hate the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to know the flesh, and we have to hate it to the extent that we want to kill it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only then can we say that we have seen the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sparing the flesh is an expression of the lack of light concerning the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we see what God sees, we will judge as God judges and reject what God rejects.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ten or twenty years ago when you were still a sinner, did you realize that you were an evil person?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No. Not only were you without this realization, but you even boasted with a bold conscience that you were better than your neighbors and that there were few in this world who were as good as you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today you know that you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When others ask if you have sinned, you say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But even though you say this with your mouth, you may not realize in your heart how evil you really are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What does it mean to be void of God's light?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being void of God's light is to fail to see what God sees.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man who does not see what God sees is one who is without His light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not know that you are a sinner, you do not have God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If someone tells you now that you are without any sin, you will not dare agree with this because you have seen a little of what God sees.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You have the light of God, and you readily admit that you have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In God's work, cutting away the flesh has much to do with God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am not saying that the goodness of the flesh cannot render man some help.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if we have God's light, we will see that God even rejects the goodness of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God says that the energy of the flesh, as well as the natural power of attraction, eloquence, ability, and wisdom of the flesh are useless in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In God's work we must not stop short of hating the fleshly energy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must deny the goodness of the flesh in the same way that we deny the weakness of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Most people know that sin is evil and that it should be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But they think secretly in their heart: "Do I have to lay down my wisdom, eloquence, and power too?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who ask such questions are void of God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I know a few workers of the Lord who are very useful in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They have all experienced intense light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may be afraid of God's light, but there are some who are not afraid of it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They want to experience God's intensified enlightening because they realize that even the best of themselves and their flesh is under God's curse and cannot be employed in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How many of us have ever been enlightened by the Lord in such a strong way?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to pray and ask God to give us a thorough revelation so that we will see what we do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we know how hopeless we are, we will repent in ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>PAYING ANY PRICE TO OBEY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Samuel charged Saul to smite the Amalekites.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Samuel was representing God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1 Samuel 15:13, Saul said to Samuel, "Blessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He thought that he had obeyed in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He felt that he had killed the weak sheep, oxen, and all the Amalekites, sparing only the best of the sheep, oxen, and King Agag.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He thought that these were inconsequential.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My brothers, can there ever be a time when obedience to God is economical?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Obedience is not an economical move.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Saul thought that it was enough for him to kill the weak sheep, oxen, and the Amalekites, and that his obedience was good and perfect enough.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He wanted to save some things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He thought that he had removed all the evil things, that enough of the Amalekites had been killed, and that he had obeyed Jehovah's commandment!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But in verse 14, Samuel said, "What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Saul said that he had fully obeyed the Lord's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But where did the sound of the sheep, the oxen, and Agag come from?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Saul was enraged.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those few sheep and oxen were too stupid.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They could bleat and low any other time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is often not up to us when the sheep bleat and the oxen low.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They bleat and low at exactly the wrong time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They were innocent!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They bleated and lowed at the wrong time!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can imagine the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Saul was about to say, "Blessed be thou...," when the sheep bleated and the oxen lowed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He was about to say, "I have performed the commandment of the Lord...," when the sound of the bleating and lowing came again.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After he finished his speech, the bleating and lowing cut in again.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then Samuel asked where the sound was coming from.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Perfect submission would not have resulted in any noise!</S>
