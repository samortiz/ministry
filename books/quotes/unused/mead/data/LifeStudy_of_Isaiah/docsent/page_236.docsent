   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The sixty-six books of the entire Bible reveal many things to us.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When all these things are embodied together as one entity, that is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sixty-six books of the Bible consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The totality of all the positive things recorded in the sixty-six books of the Bible is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, we may say that the Bible unveils to us the central line of the divine revelation, which is God's economy and God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the other hand, we may say in brief that the totality of what the Bible reveals to us is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Jerusalem is the total composition of the entire revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The foundation of the New Jerusalem consists of twelve layers of precious stones Rev 21:14, 19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some fundamental books written on the foundation of the New Jerusalem have pointed out that the colors of the twelve layers of precious stones in the foundation of the New Jerusalem look like a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Genesis 9:8-17, the rainbow is a sign that reminds us of God's faithfulness in keeping His word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's faithfulness is based on His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there were no righteousness, there would be no faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the foundation of the New Jerusalem is the righteousness of God with God's faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Within the New Jerusalem there is a river of life, which flows, or spirals, from the top of the city to the bottom, to reach all the twelve gates Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That flowing of the river of life saturates the entire city.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the two sides of the river the tree of life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the content of the New Jerusalem is life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Within the city the river of life flows and the tree of life grows as a vine along the two banks of the river, to supply the entire city.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that the entire New Jerusalem is a matter of life built on the foundation of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Life is the consummation of righteousness, and righteousness is the base, the foundation, of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the New Jerusalem, life issues from light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to Revelation 21:23, in the New Jerusalem there is no need of the shining of the sun or the moon, for the glory of God illumines it, and its lamp is the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that Christ is the lamp, and the very God embodied in Christ is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, in the foundation of the New Jerusalem we can see faithfulness based upon righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can also see that the light in the New Jerusalem issues in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the New Jerusalem is the embodiment of God's full salvation, and God's full salvation is a composition of God's righteousness as the base and God's life as the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ultimately, God's full salvation is Christ as the covenant plus Christ as the light, and this is the composition of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's full salvation is based on His righteousness and is consummated in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ as the covenant takes care of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, that covenant is the foundation of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then Christ as the light carries out God's salvation to consummate God's salvation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, Christ as the covenant and Christ as the light, added together, equal God's full salvation.</S>
