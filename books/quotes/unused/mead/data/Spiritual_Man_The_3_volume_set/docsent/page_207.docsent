   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some believers, after committing sins, remain unperturbed in their spirit as if nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A healthy spirit, after a sin has been committed, invariably would be broken just like David's. Indeed, a man with a broken spirit can easily be recovered back to God.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A believer's spirit must reach a stage of constantly fearing God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The presumptuous and self-willed heart must be completely broken, allowing the word of God to be the guide in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A believer must have this holy respect, having absolutely no trust in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since his spirit has already been beaten, he dares not lift up his head; instead, he always obeys the command of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A hardened spirit is always an obstacle in obeying the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only after the cross has accomplished a thorough work in enabling the believer to clearly know the unreliability of his ideas, feelings, and desires does he dare not become presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He becomes extremely cautious in all things, knowing that they will doubtlessly fail without the intervening and keeping power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must not become independent of God.</S>
