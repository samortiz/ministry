   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN OUR SPIRIT BORN OF GOD AND THE SEED OF GOD IN IT Scripture Reading: 1 John 3:9; 5:4a; John 3:6b; 2 Pet 1:4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the fifth mystery in 1 John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We began with the mystery of life, the divine, eternal life which is in reality the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then we spoke of fellowship, that is, the life moving in us to bring God and us into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After that we continued with the mutual abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We abide in the Triune God and He abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then in the last message we dealt with the anointing, the moving within us of the Triune God as the all-inclusive compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The anointing, as we said, imparts the divine elements into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these elements are included in the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Besides divinity, there is humanity, Christ's death and its effectiveness, and His resurrection and the power of that resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This life-giving Spirit, the very Triune God processed into our being, is now anointing, "painting," us that we may gain more of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we receive not only the divine elements but also the death and resurrection of Christ, we get the proper killing and the rich nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That wonderful death works in us to kill the negative things of our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That wonderful resurrection supplies us with Christ's divine riches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By this anointing we are being transformed and are growing into maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fifth mystery in 1 John is twofold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It comprises both our regenerated spirit and the seed of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are within us, though they are abstract and invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>MAN'S TRIPARTITE NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible clearly teaches that we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The belief that man has three parts body, soul, and spirit is called trichotomy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Genesis 2:7 "the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even from this verse it is clear that man has three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God firstly used the dust to form a physical body for man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then He used breath to form man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The breath of life got into man and became his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The spirit of man is mentioned in Proverbs 20:27.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spirit and breath in Hebrew are the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that the breath breathed into man became the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When these two parts, the body and spirit, came together, they produced the third part, a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First Thessalonians 5:23 also mentions these three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Trichotomy then is a scriptural teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some Christian teachers, however, believe instead in dichotomy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They follow psychology, which claims that man has a visible, outward part and an invisible, inward part.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The outward part is lower; the inward, higher.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To those who believe this way, the spirit and soul are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The translators for the New American Standard Version evidently believe this way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Philippians 2:2 they have "united in spirit" and in 2:20 "of kindred spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In both instances the Greek word is not spirit but psuche, soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our Recovery Version we are careful to translate these words according to the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These scholars may know Greek well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet because of their concept that spirit and soul are synonyms, they have translated according to their concept rather than according to what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you believe that spirit, mind, soul, and heart are simply different ways of referring to one thing?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible makes a distinction!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It treasures our spirit while it condemns our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In His salvation, God has rejected our soul but regenerated our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our spirit is a pleasure to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Animals have souls, but trees and flowers do not.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we do not distinguish between the spirit and the soul, we put ourselves in the same category as cats and dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As human beings, we have a treasured part.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord "stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How great must be the spirit of man for it to be ranked with the heavens and the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Bible, besides God there are three important things: the heavens, the earth, and man's spirit not his soul .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are not mere animals.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are men with a spirit.</S>
