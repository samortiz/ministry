   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALLOWING GOD TO PASS THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EVERYTHING IN OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is our balance and our regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without God, we become extreme, leaning too much either to the right or to the left.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we allow God to be the center, our person will immediately be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For instance, if a poor person is without God, he suffers very much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Never think that it is a bad thing to be rich and a good thing to be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should know that just as riches cause people to sin, so also poverty causes people to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many immoral things and many acts of robbery are motivated by poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because man does not allow God to regulate and balance him in his poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the other hand, we have also seen many poor saints who fear God and have God within them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who contact these poor saints do not sense a flavor of deprivation but smell the fragrance of God within them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is because they are influenced and regulated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, the rich also commit many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If God s regulation has a place in man s wealthiness, many sinful things will not be done.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rich people are extravagant, indulge in pleasure, and waste their money because they are empty and do not have God as their inner regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was a couple who dearly loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They had a son who loved the Lord very much and was about to be married.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This family had originally planned to give a great banquet at the wedding and invite many relatives and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, because they belonged to God, they brought this matter before the Lord to inquire whether God was happy with their plans.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After they had prayed a little before God, they immediately felt that what they were planning to do was excessive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God showed them that there were still many saints who were lacking in basic needs such as food and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, they reduced their estimated costs for the wedding to one-third of what it was originally, and they gave one-third to the poor saints and the other third to the printing of gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This example shows that even the matter of our children s marriage must be brought before God and be carried out in a relationship with God in order to bring in the real blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If wealth does not have God s balance, it will definitely be harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The world today is evil because the poor as well as the rich all commit sins; everyone lacks God s regulation and does not take God as their center.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once a person loses God, he does not have a center.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, whenever we encounter something unpleasant, we must bring it before God; then we will immediately experience God coming in to balance us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God will do a regulating work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The general practice when someone s parents pass away is that his relatives and friends come to comfort him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At such a time it is very difficult to restrain one s grief.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, as Christians, we can bring our grief before God and let God balance it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do this, God will not allow us to grieve excessively.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, if something pleasant happens to us, we must bring it to God and let Him regulate us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This will keep us from being overly excited.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have observed some people who are too happy and are carried away by their success.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, something adverse happens and their joy is turned to sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, we must have God in all our joy and sorrow so that our life will not lose its regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I once had to travel a long distance and climb over many mountains with others to reach a rural area to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In those days because there were no cars or trains, we could only hire someone to pull a cart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we were going up a mountain, the man pulling the cart had to exert much effort.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because we saw that it was very strenuous for him, we walked up the mountain ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was summertime, and after we had used our strength to climb up to the top of the mountain, we were covered with sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After we got back into the cart, the journey down the mountain was a terrifying experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The cart did not have brakes, and although the man pulling the cart tried to stop it, he was not able to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The only thing he could do was to run down the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was truly frightening.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After that, we decided not to ride in the cart when going either uphill or downhill.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because some people do not have brakes in their lives, when times are bad, they become despondent to an extreme and may even want to commit suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When they are happy, it goes to their head, and they want to indulge in eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is because they do not have God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If Christians do not allow God to be their center, they will go to an extreme when they encounter joy or sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some people often lose their temper when eating at home.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the food tastes good, they complain that there is too little; if it tastes bad, they complain that there is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They may become so angry that they even turn the table over.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not think that man can restrain himself from losing his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only rocks and wood never lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every normal person has a temper, but it must be regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we allow our temper to pass through God, our temper will be within measure.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some ask, How can we not lose our temper excessively?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The only way is to turn to God and wait awhile, allowing Him to balance us whenever we are about to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even in trivial matters in our living, such as our attire, we should have God within us regulating, balancing, and passing through us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should never consider that attire is a matter of personal choice.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we buy clothes, the material, the color, and the style should all pass through God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the way we dress is before God, our dress and attire will be balanced and able to benefit others and cause them to be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sometimes our fashionable attire, which we think is very attractive, actually causes others to feel uncomfortable and uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If this is the case, we have not benefited from our attire, nor have others felt pleasant about it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One time when Dr. John Sung was preaching the gospel in Hankow, a very fashionably dressed young woman came in. After hearing the gospel, she was very touched and wanted to discuss the matter further.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, when she approached Dr. Sung, he strongly rebuked her and sent her away.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On one hand, this young woman was very sad, for she had truly been touched; on the other hand, she was very angry.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She thought, How could a servant of God rebuke someone based simply on her appearance?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She went home venting her anger and crying, and she prayed, O God, You do not look at the outward appearance; You look at the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, as she was praying, she had a clear feeling from God, which told her, You have turned your heart to God inwardly, but why would you not turn your being to God outwardly?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Why would you not make your outward appearance match your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, she stopped crying, changed her appearance, and went to see Dr. Sung again the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When Dr. Sung saw her, he warmly welcomed her.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God can balance everything that happens in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To allow God to balance us results in a beautiful living.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If a person is balanced by God, whether in joy, anger, sorrow, or delight, his living will be smooth and relaxed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When he should be angry, he will be angry; when he should be happy, he will be happy; when he dresses, he will dress suitably; when he eats, he will eat appropriately.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Everything will be within the proper limit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This kind of living cannot be achieved by man himself but requires man to allow God to work within him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There was once a servant of the Lord in the United States who had to move from his hometown to another city.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When he had arranged the furnishings in his new house, he invited his elderly father to come and inspect the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>His father said that everything was very good, but one thing bothered him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The son was curious and asked him what it was, and he answered, When people come into the house, they will not be able to tell whether a son of God or a child of the devil lives here.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This old man feared God very much.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This shows that to have God in what we do is a very great principle.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When we decide to do something, we must consider whether God is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If the element of God is in our determination, we will require whatever we do, even the furnishing of our house, to have God in it.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>TAKING GOD AS THE CENTER OF OUR HUMAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Perhaps some will ask, How can I let God influence my life and regulate my living?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The answer is very simple: we need to take God as the center of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Although a believer is saved, he may not fully realize that God is in him and that he needs to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Such a person does not have God s feeling and does not recognize that God should be his unique center.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We need God to be the center of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Perhaps the young brothers and sisters are focused on their studies, but they need to realize that the center of their entire life should not be their books; it must be God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If books become their center, the books will do them more harm than good in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Those who love money will be harmed by money and will come under its bondage sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Even though a person may be joined to many good things, if God is not balancing him inwardly, his situation will be very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In the church we encounter certain saints who often criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is very negative.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In their criticizing there is no element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>They impart no benefit to others; rather, they inflict much harm on others.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If one has God in his living, he will be a benefit not only to his family but also to his society and country.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If a Christian has God as his center, his manner and attitude will be normal and proper, and his actions and conduct will be appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>A FEW MATTERS REQUIRING OUR ATTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Since God is the proper center of the human life, there are five things that we must do.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>First, we must take God as the center of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If we do this, regardless of what field we eventually work in, we will perform our work very well.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Conversely, if we do not take God as the center in our occupation, we can potentially harm ourselves, our society, and our country.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>I hope you will grasp this point firmly and accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Second, we must love God.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We must see that if we love anything apart from God, the thing we love will become a problem to us.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Loving God is the only thing we can do that will not become a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>All man s love should be poured upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>All our hearts should love God.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Third, we must consecrate ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>At least once we should pray to God thoroughly, offering ourselves completely to Him and allowing Him to be the center of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We should never be afraid that if we consecrate our life to God, our future will be difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Such a fear is unfounded.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If we consecrate ourselves to God, our human life will be a balanced life.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We should allow God to come into us and be our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Fourth, we must contact God in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>In our daily walk we should obey the feeling that God gives us within.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If He prohibits us from doing a certain thing, we should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If we have the feeling that He wants us to do something, we should do it properly.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We need to diligently obey every feeling we receive from God.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Fifth, we must spend time to get into His Word, to labor on the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We must study the Bible properly from its first word to its last.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We need to see not only the facts but also the principles, the life, and the truth contained therein.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>If we exercise in this way, we become like transparent glass.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Whatever comes to us will not be a problem, because God will regulate us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>We can see in the New Testament that Paul was such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>He knew how to be abased and how to abound, how to be filled and how to hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>In everything and in all things he had learned the secret Phil 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Neither suffering nor joy could press him down.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>He had the secret, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Paul took Christ as his center in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Hence, when he was in prison, he was able to endure sufferings that would be unbearable to others.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>He could do all things in Him who empowered him v. 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>A person like Paul is shining and released.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>All those who approach this kind of person will be helped.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Even the face of such a person reflects God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>He has been saved to the extent that he is not only saved within, but even his face expresses God s salvation without.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>His face is a mirror reflecting God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>God is regulating and balancing within this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>May God have mercy on us that we would bring every matter to Him and let every matter pass through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>In this way we will have God as our center and regulation in everything in our living, whether great or small.</S>
