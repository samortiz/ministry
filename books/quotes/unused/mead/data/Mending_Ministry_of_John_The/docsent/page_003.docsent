   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD BECOMING INCARNATE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first section presents Christ as God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The very first verse says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Word was not only with God; He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I would ask you, Is Christ the Son of God or God Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even in John 1 this problem arises; verse 18 refers to Him as "the only begotten Son."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1:1 Christ is God; in 1:18 He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I leave this question for you to consider.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 14 further says regarding the Word, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us full of grace and reality."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God became flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No wonder Paul says, "Great is the mystery of godliness" 1 Tim 3:16 !</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus of Nazareth was nothing less than God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebrews 13:8 does tell us, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In eternity past, however, Christ was not a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"In the beginning" John 1:1 means in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then He was God but not man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A day came, however, when He became incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the incarnation He took on another form.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There was no change in His divine nature; only His outward appearance changed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He subsisted in the form of God, "but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men" Phil 2:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>GRACE AND REALITY BROUGHT TO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For what purpose did Christ become a man?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was in order that grace and reality might come to us John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is reality?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everything in the universe is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nothing is real except God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without Him, whatever we have is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has come, by the incarnation, to be our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Word incarnate was "full of grace."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 17 goes on to tell us, "For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Christians consider material blessings as God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From this verse, however, it is clear before the coming of the Lord Jesus grace was not available to man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There may have been material blessings in the Old Testament, but there was not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When God became a man, grace came.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Grace is God as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we receive Him, we have reality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This reality becomes our enjoyment, which is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Grace is God Himself as our life, our light, our holiness, and our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To enjoy God in such an all-inclusive way is to enjoy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before Christ came, such an enjoyment of Him was not possible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now that He has become incarnate, He can be man's reality and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 16 says, "For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have received of His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This includes countless items: joy, comfort, peace, rest, forgiveness, redemption, righteousness, patience, holiness, power, light, sight, etc. In ourselves we lack all these.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not have patience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are not submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All we have is negative sins, weaknesses, and shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible tells wives to submit to their husbands Eph 5:22 and husbands to love their wives v. 25 . Who can fulfill this word? Women are not submissive, and men are not loving.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But both submission and love are included in the fullness we have received from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have received of His fullness, grace upon grace!</S>
