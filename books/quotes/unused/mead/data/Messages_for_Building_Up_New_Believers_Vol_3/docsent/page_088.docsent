   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord said, You...have not denied My name v. 8 . This is another characteristic of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the long history of the church throughout the ages, the name of the Lord Jesus has always been last in importance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Men pay attention to names of saints, such as Peter and other apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They pay attention to names they like or to names of doctrines and nations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many say proudly, I am a Lutheran, or I am a Wesleyan.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are names of countries.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These names have divided God s children into divisions!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is as if the name of Christ were not enough to separate us from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If someone asks you, Who are you? and you answer, I am a Christian, he will not be satisfied.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>a. The Lord s Name Being Enough</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To the Lord, His name is enough for His children.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But we have to wait until Philadelphia before we see men who are satisfied with the Lord s name alone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no need to have so many divisive names.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His name alone is enough!</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Philadelphia has abolished all other names and has exalted only the name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please bear in mind that the Lord cares for this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This one thing is the basis for His praise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is something pleasing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not belittle this and do not be careless about it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord takes the time to point out that they have confessed His name and have not denied His name.</S>
