<h1 class="title">THE LAW OF MOUNT SINAI</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Exo. 19</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The nature of man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man does not know himself. <em>This passage needs to be emphasized.</em>
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>On the day that the Israelites went to the lower part of Mt. Sinai, they did not know themselves.</li>
		<li>Man thinks that he can do good by his own effort and that he can keep the law of God. This is just like the Israelites&rsquo; answer to the Lord, &ldquo;All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>The fact that man thought he could do good and keep the law is a strong proof that man does not know himself.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The real condition of man.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The real condition of the Israelites was that they did a good number of things against God&rsquo;s covenant. God did not allow them to make idols, but they made them. They even worshipped the idols. Their real condition was totally against God&rsquo;s law.</li>
		<li>Man thought he could do good, but actually he could not do good at all. Do you think that you can do good? Do you think that you can love your parents? As a matter of fact, you still love yourself the most. <em>Give some real examples of sin to touch their feeling.</em></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The manifestation of God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The law was given to expose the real condition of man.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God gave the law to man because the Israelites did not realize their real condition. God gave the law not for the Israelites to keep, but for exposing their real condition.</li>
		<li>When man does not try to keep the law, he does not realize how corrupted he is. But once he tries to keep the law, he immediately discovers how powerless he is in keeping the law.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>There is no one who has not transgressed the law.<br />
	Even before Moses brought the law back from Mount Sinai, the Israelites had already offended the law. That is why Moses cast the tables out of his hands and broke them on the way. That was a declaration that the law had been broken by the Israelites.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The content of the law<br />
<span class="normal"><em>This part does not need to be covered in too much detail. Just pick some important points and emphasize them.</em></span>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Combine the first few of the ten commandments and present some practical examples to explain how man has worshipped false gods.</li>
	<li>Honor your father and your mother.</li>
	<li>Thou shalt not kill.</li>
	<li>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</li>
	<li>Thou shalt not steal.</li>
	<li>Thou shalt not lie.</li>
	<li>Thou shalt not covet.<br />
	<em>These items should be spoken in a very strong way, like thundering, even making the people tremble.</em></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The situation of man before the law
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Everyone has offended the law.</li>
	<li>No one can stand self-confidently before the law.</li>
	<li>Man is terrified when the law is presented. Describe how the Israelites were terrified at Mt. Sinai on that day.</li>
	<li>The law exposes the sins of man.</li>
	<li>The law also condemns the sins of man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s saving way
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ was condemned and judged in our stead. He has redeemed us from the curse of the law.</li>
	<li>God wants us to receive the redemption of Christ that we may be exempt from the condemnation of the law.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
