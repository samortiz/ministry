   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE FUNCTION OF THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We realize that man's position before God is that of a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now, let us consider why God set up the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once we understand the law, we will be able to understand God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has always known man's condition, but does man know his own condition?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since sin has been manifested before God, it should also be felt in man's conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But is man's conscience aware of sin?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Unfortunately, it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because man is unaware of sin, we need the functioning of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Tonight we will study this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is the law?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The law is nothing other than God's demand on man that man work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Romans, Ephesians, and Galatians, the apostle Paul shows repeatedly that man is saved by grace, not by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, man is saved because God works for man, not because man works for God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not a matter of being something before God or doing something for God, but a matter of God Himself coming into our midst to become something and do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why the apostle, under the revelation of the Holy Spirit, constantly emphasized that, both for the Gentile and the Jew, salvation is absolutely of grace and not of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We want to spend some time to see that it is impossible for man to be saved by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am not using the term law in reference to the law mentioned in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Law, as I use it here, refers to a principle, that is, the principle of man working for God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will see whether or not our salvation is due to our working for God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way I use the word law is not without a biblical basis.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostle Paul used words in a very precise and meaningful way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Bible the word Christ is often used.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the original language, sometimes there is no definite article before the word Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At other times there is a definite article, and thus we should understand it as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unfortunately, not many versions translate this accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Another word that is often used is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes there is a definite article; in these places it is the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Similarly, there are places in the Bible where the word law has a definite article, and we should read the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The meanings of these words with the definite article is quite different from their meanings without the definite article.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, when Christ is mentioned, it refers to the Lord Jesus Christ; but when the Christ is mentioned, you and I are also included.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Bible speaks of the individual Christ, there is no definite article; but when it speaks of the Christ who includes us, we find the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Bible speaks of our individual believing, it uses faith, without the article.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when it speaks of what we believe in, that is, our faith, it uses the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Bible translators all know that whenever the Bible mentions the faith, it is not referring to our individual believing, but to that which we believe in. What then is the law? In the Bible, the law always refers to the Mosaic law, the law in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if there is no definite article before law, it refers to the requirement God places upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, let us keep in mind that law in the Bible does not merely refer to the law given to us by God through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In many places in the Bible, law refers to the principle God applies toward us, or the principle of God's requirement of us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The law does not only mean the Mosaic law, the law given on Mount Sinai, or the Old Testament law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It also means the condition for fellowship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The condition for fellowship between God and man is God's requirement upon man, what God wants man to do for Him, to accomplish for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Is man saved by the works of the law?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Does God save man because man has done things for God?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The whole world says we must do good before God will save us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we put this in biblical terms, it means that we must have the works of the law in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who talk this way have made two great mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first is that they do not know who man is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The second is that they do not know what God's intention was when He gave man the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we know what we are, surely we will not say that man needs to have works of the law in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we know the purpose of God's giving the law, neither will we say that man can be saved through the works of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because man has made these two great mistakes, he bears the wrong concept and says wrong things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE FIRST GREAT MISTAKE</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>NOT KNOWING WHAT MAN IS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why would man say that he can be saved by the works of the law when he does not even know what he is?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is because man does not know how evil he is; he does not know that he is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since man has become fleshly, there are three things in him that are unchangeable: his conduct, his lust, and his will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because man is fleshly, whatever he does is sin and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the same time, his lust within is actively tempting him, provoking him to sin all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In addition, man's will and desire reject God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since man's conduct is against God, his lust is provoking him to sin, and his will is rebellious against God, there is no possibility for him to have the works of the law and be obedient to God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, it is impossible for man to satisfy God's requirement by the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Not only do we have our outward conduct, but we also have the lust in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not only do we have the lust in our body, but we also have the will in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You may be able to deal with your conduct, but the lust stirring within you, even if it is not successful in precipitating sinful, outward conduct, exists and provokes you all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>And even if you hate your lust and do your best to deal with it, your will is altogether not compatible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Deep in his heart, man is rebellious against God and wants to crucify the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the one hand, the cross signifies God's love; but on the other hand, it signifies man's sin.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The cross signifies the great love God has in dealing with man; but it also signifies the tremendous hatred man has toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross not only by the Jews, but also by the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Man's will toward God has never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Man's will is totally at enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Romans 8:7-8 says, "Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>And those who are in the flesh cannot please God."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The mind set on the flesh is enmity against God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Those who are in the flesh are not subject to the law of God, neither can they be.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We do not understand man enough.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We think that man is still curable and useful.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, we say that the works of the law can still save man.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But man can never be subject to the law of God; it is just not in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In our conduct there is not the power to be subject to the law, and our nature cannot be.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Not only are we unable to be subject to the law, we simply are not willing to be.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Being unable to be in subjection is a matter of our nature and our lust; being unwilling to be in subjection is a matter of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Basically, man is not subject to God in his will.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore, the law will manifest nothing except man's weakness, uncleanness, and sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It will not manifest man's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If one says that a person can have life and be justified by the works of the law, he really does not know man.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If man were not fleshly or sinful, the law could perhaps give him life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is why Galatians 3:12 says, "He who does them the works of the law shall live because of them."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Unfortunately, human beings are all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They are fleshly and powerless in being subject to God, and they have no heart to be subject to God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Man does not have power to do the works of the law, nor does he have the heart to do the works of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The law is good but the person who does the works of the law is not.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We all must admit this.</S>
