   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT IMPRESSIONS AFTER VISITING CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, I am disappointed with the condition of Christianity that I saw during my visit abroad, but on the other hand, I have more faith in the way of the church that we are taking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I cannot fellowship concerning all my inner feelings, but I will share something as an introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE DISAPPOINTING CONDITION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>OF CHRISTIANS IN THE WEST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though the condition in the Far East is not ideal, the condition in the West is worse.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We did not fellowship with all God s children in the West, but in the past we contacted Christianity in the West through their publications.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also studied their history.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We did not fellowship with them often, but we became familiar with them through their writings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, even though we did not contact every Christian group, we feel that we have a clear understanding of the situation in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before this trip it did not occur to me that the situation in the West could be so poor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before we left England, a brother asked me about my impression of Christians in America and Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I responded that I was disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I said that because the believers who preached the gospel in the Far East came from Christian countries in the West, I had not thought that the condition in the West could be so poor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I will not give all the reasons for my disappointment, because an inaccurate repetition of this fellowship can cause misunderstandings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, I am not the only one who has this realization.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The brothers whom I spoke with in the West did not say that the condition in the West is good.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These brothers were not being humble, nor were they being polite.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They were sincere and honest in what they said.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The believers with whom I fellowshipped spoke of the poor condition in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nearly all the saints here asked me about the spiritual things I saw in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I did not touch many spiritual things during my trip.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the one place where I should have seen something spiritual, I saw a lack of harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There was no spiritual atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most of the believers there, who fellowshipped with me, acknowledged that there was a lack of harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There was almost nothing spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I received some help from this trip, because it is always profitable for a person to visit other places.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the help that I received was not on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, I was greatly disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I also saw that believers have an exaggerated opinion of us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The believers whom I visited received me as someone who could help them, not as someone who could receive help from them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, most of the believers fellowshipped their difficulties with me, just as a patient speaks to a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They did not speak of any positive situations with me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I traveled from the Far East to the West and back to the Far East, and the brothers in every place that I visited fellowshipped about their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It may be that the believers came to us with their problems because they regard us too highly and think that we can help them solve their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Confirmation of the Way</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>of the Lord s Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As I visited the different places, observed the local situations, and contacted the saints, I gained an understanding of the actual condition in each place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My observation of the condition also strengthened my faith in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My faith is strengthened to take the way of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more places I visited, the more I understood that their problems and difficulties are because they do not take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though the needs and problems in every place differ, the answer to these needs and problems is found in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the believers could know, see, and receive this way, spontaneously their needs would be met and their problems would be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, what I observed strengthened my faith in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is difficult to find an example in church history of the way that we are taking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is also difficult to find a person who has taken this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to our consideration, we discovered this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We did not invent it; we discovered it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, as we take this way, on the one hand, we feel that it is according to God s leading, but on the other hand, we sometimes feel that we may be too much, since there is no precedent in church history.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the one hand, we feel that this way is of God and is according to His leading; on the other hand, since there is no precedent in church history, we feel that we may be peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, what we saw in the different places gives us a strong confirmation that this way is truly according to God s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The different needs and problems are the issue of a lack of vision and revelation concerning this way.</S>
