   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HOUSEHOLD BEING ALSO THE UNIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF GOD'S PUNISHMENT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see some verses which show that the unit of God's punishment is also the household.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When man rebelled against God, God was provoked and He judged man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In judging man He took the household as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's judgment comes through one man to the entire household, just as God's blessing comes through one man to the entire household.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once we see this, we will take a stand for our household and declare that our household is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. Pharaoh and His House</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 12:17 says, "The Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram's wife."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sin of Pharaoh brought God's plague to his whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God punished his whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God's judgment comes to a household, we should expect that His blessing also will come to a household.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not those under condemnation but those under His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. The House of Abimelech</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Genesis 20:18 says, "For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God closed up all the wombs of the women of the house of Abimelech.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His whole household was punished, not just one or two men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. The House of David</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second Samuel 12:10-11 says, "Now therefore the sword will not depart from your house forever because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus says Jehovah, I will now raise up trouble against you from within your house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and will give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After David sinned, God did not rebuke and punish him individually.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said, "Now therefore the sword will not depart from your house."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>David sinned individually, but the result was that his whole household was judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God's eyes the people of this world are divided into households, not individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to come to God household by household.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>D. The House of Jeroboam</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Kings 13:34 says, "This matter became a sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as even to cut it off and destroy it from the face of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jeroboam was the one who set up the idols, but God judged his house and destroyed it from the face of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Kings 14:14 says, "Jehovah will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam this day and even now."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jeroboam worshipped idols, but God cut off his house.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do not know why God did this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can only say that in God's eyes a household is a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is too clear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unless we purposely ignore this fact, we have no choice but to acknowledge it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>E. The House of Baasha</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Kings 16:3 says, "I am now sweeping up after Baasha and after his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because of the sin of one man, Baasha, God took away the posterity of Baasha and his house, in the same way that he cut off the house of Jeroboam.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God deals with man by households.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>F. The House of Ahab</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I think one of the most well-known houses in the book of 1 Kings is the house of Ahab.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Kings 21:22 says, "I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah because of the provocation by which you have provoked Me to anger and caused Israel to sin."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why did God deal with the house of Ahab?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because Ahab provoked God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ahab was an evil king in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God said that He would deal with his house as He dealt with the house of Jeroboam and the house of Baasha.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The entire house would be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The unit of God's dealing is the household.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is more than clear and obvious.</S>
