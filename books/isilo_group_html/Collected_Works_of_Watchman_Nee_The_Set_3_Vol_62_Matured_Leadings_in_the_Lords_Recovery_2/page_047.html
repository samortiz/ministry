In listening to him, I first touch his spirit with my spirit. The main question is whether or not the spirit is released. Whether a message can supply others depends on the release of the spirit of the speaker. It has to do with whether or not the message touches others' spirit. This has nothing to do with whether or not the message is well delivered and whether the explanations are clear. Often I hear young people boasting: "If Brother Lee can say ten things about this topic, I can say twenty things about it." You may have a loud voice, balanced logic, and a clear mind. But if you do not have the spirit, what you have amounts to nothing but the letter. Hebrews 5:12-14 says that in order to discriminate between the divine words of righteousness and the elementary words of the beginning, one's faculties have to be exercised. He also has to be experienced in the practice. In order for a person to run fast, he must not only be able to walk well but must practice the skill of running all the time. In order to develop spiritual consciousness, one must not only use his spirit but must touch the feeling of his spirit all the time. Only then will he be experienced in his practice.</p><p>Everything of the church must be conducted in the spirit. It is not a matter of getting things done and establishing right procedures. Even if the church in Hong Kong copies Taipei's mode of service, it will only be letter if the spirit is ignored. My main concern all these years in the church is not sin, but the letter. Many spiritual things look alike from the outside, but within there is no spiritual reality at all.</p><p>In Shanghai a brother once said that a certain person's message is not bad. But others do not touch life when they hear him. The same can be said of our spiritual service. It is not enough to do things well outwardly; there must also be spiritual reality. Others must receive life inwardly; they must be edified. A church can have zeal. It can have good doctrines. Outwardly everything may be in very good order. But if there is no spirit, everything is letter. The church cannot just have an outward show of spirituality; it must live in the spiritual reality.</p><p>In 2 Corinthians 3:6 Paul said that the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Paul was opposed to the letter, which is the Old Testament Scripture. We can say the same thing today. We must realize that everything is letter without the Spirit. This does not mean that we are spiritual as long as we can give a spiritual message. Being spiritual means that we have touched the spiritual reality. In order for the church to remain in the reality of the spiritual realm, we must first learn to pick up a kind of spiritual consciousness.</p><p>In the meetings, in listening to a message, in prayer, and in preaching the gospel, we have to train our spirit to be sensitive. If others have a spirit and our spirit does not respond, it means that there is something wrong with us. If we cannot use our spirit, our spiritual life will surely wilt away. John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." We do worldly things by our flesh. When a man cannot exercise his flesh, his life comes to an end. In the same way if a Christian cannot use his spirit, he falls to a very low point.</p><p>I do not say this because I have any desire to rebuke you. I am merely trying to share something more related to the matter of spiritual consciousness. We are releasing a burden concerning spiritual consciousness. Paul's quotation of the Old Testament was different from the Pharisees' quotation of the Old Testament. Paul had the spirit, but the Pharisees did not have it (John 5:39-40). In spiritual matters, sameness is not a matter of having common doctrines; there is also a matter of inward reality. Sameness is not merely being the same in everything. Similarity is not the same as to be fully identified with something. There is a world of difference between sameness and similarity. One person can imitate another in voice, tone, and doctrine. All these things can be similar. But without the spirit, all that one has is the letter. The foundation of Christianity lies in the presence of the Holy Spirit. In Matthew 7 the Lord says that before the judgment seat, some will claim that they prophesied, cast out demons, and performed works of power in His name. But the Lord will tell them, "I never knew you" (vv. 22-23). We can be zealous for the Lord's work. We can even cast out demons and perform works of power by exercising authority, but the basic question is not how much we have done, but whether we are born of the flesh or of the Spirit. Only by knowing and cultivating a spiritual consciousness will our action be something born of the Spirit. Only this will be accepted by the Lord.</p><p>Hence, outward sameness does not necessarily mean that we have the same thing. Many people come to Hong Kong and have many things to say about the church. I know that these criticisms are wrong. They are mainly reasonings and opinions. It is absolutely useless to argue about outward practices; there is no spirit in it. One brother came to Hong Kong and criticized the practice here; he considered it inferior to the practices in Shanghai and Taipei. But the real question is whether or not there is the spirit. If there is the spirit, we have the sameness, and everything is well. Today in Hong Kong everything is good, but there is a great shortage in spiritual consciousness. We must thoroughly learn our lessons here. Some may think that this is a very hard lesson to learn. Actually, this is not hard at all. It may not be that easy to discern the proper pathway from the positive side, but we can at least discern our mistakes from the negative side.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
