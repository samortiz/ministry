   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE TRANSFORMING WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 12:1-5, 11; 1 Cor 3:9-12a; 1 Pet 2:2-5; Rev 2:17 THE CRUCIAL POINT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament shows us that Christ as the Word of God, who is God Himself, became flesh to be the Lamb of God John 1:1, 14, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the Lamb of God, Christ went to the cross and suffered death in order to accomplish redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ s death accomplished many things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It dealt with and took away all the negative matters that are condemned by God and do not fit His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in His resurrection Christ was released.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through His resurrection He produced us as His multiplication, as the many grains, the many brothers of Christ, and the sons of God, who are the constituents of Christ s Body 12:24; 20:17; Rom 8:29; Heb 2:11-12; Eph 1:22b-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Body of Christ is simply the constitution of Christ in all His members 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Following His resurrection, Christ ascended to the heavens, and in His ascension He positioned us in the heavens and afforded, equipped, and furnished us with whatever we need for our function in the Body Eph 2:6; 4:7-8, 11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ has accomplished all these things through His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now Christ has come into our being to dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ has become the indwelling Christ, who is now within us to apply Himself to our being for His work of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not a small matter to say that Christ is applying Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and indwelling Christ, in whom is divinity, humanity, the all-inclusive death, the wonderful resurrection, and the marvelous ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All these are included in the One who indwells us and applies to us everything that He is, has, and has obtained, attained, and gained.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is for His work of transformation within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His death He dealt with all the negative things, in His resurrection He multiplied Himself in the many grains, and in His ascension He positioned us and equipped us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has accomplished everything, but all these things have not been fully wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Again, we may compare this to typesetting and printing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the typesetting is completed, there is still the need to impress, to print, what has been typeset onto paper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The work of the indwelling Christ is to apply all that He has accomplished to our being to make us a copy, a reproduction, and a reprint of Himself so that we may be His Body in actuality and practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is by this indwelling work that He transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Transformation includes building Rev 21:18-20 ; hence, it is by Christ s transforming work that the church is built up and the bride is prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the bride is ready, Christ will come to reign in the millennial kingdom with His bride as His co-kings for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose 19:6-7; 20:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After this, the millennium will usher in the new heaven and the new earth, where there will be the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the church for eternity 21:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should all be impressed with this brief summary.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the crucial point of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The crucial point of the New Testament is not that husbands would love their wives or wives would submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These things can be found in ethical teachings, such as the teachings of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In these teachings, however, we cannot find the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and indwelling of Christ with His transforming and building work for the preparation of the bride, the kingdom, and the ultimate consummation of God s building, the New Jerusalem, in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are found only in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The New Testament does not focus even on going to heaven or to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The focus of the New Testament is that Christ produces the church through His death, resurrection, ascension, indwelling, and transforming and building work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus said, Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the main point of the New Testament.</S>
