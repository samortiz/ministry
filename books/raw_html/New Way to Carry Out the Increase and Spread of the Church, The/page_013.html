	<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW CONVERTS<br />
TO CALL ON THE LORD AND TO PRAY-READ</h2>
<p>The home meetings are the home meetings of the new converts. You must help them to consider that it is their meeting. It is not your meeting. It is not that you invite them to come to your meeting, but it should be that they would invite you to go to their meeting.</p>
<p>To nourish the new converts in their home meeting, you have to tell them that the Bible is the word of God. In one visit, you can read them the verses at the beginning of this chapter and help them to pray-read, telling them that we live not only by physical food, but by &ldquo;every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4). For our physical body, we need the physical food, but for our spirit, we need the word of God. Do not say too much. Read Jeremiah 15:16 which says, &ldquo;Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts.&rdquo; Then explain a little concerning eating the word. You could tell them that Matthew 4:4 tells us that the word of God is our food, and that Jeremiah 15:16 tells us to eat the word. Eating the word is not merely to read nor to study, but simply to eat. Then read John 6:63, where the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life,&rdquo; and tell them that the way this word becomes spirit and life is by our taking it into us. Then you could also read to them Psalm 119:130, &ldquo;The entrance of thy words giveth light,&rdquo; and explain, that the word is not only spirit and life, but by entering into us through our eating, it becomes light to us.</p>
<p>You may then need to read to them Romans 10:12b. &ldquo;The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; You may explain to them a little what calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading are. Do not say too much. After you do this, right away you could say, &ldquo;Let us pray-read these few verses.&rdquo; In one visit simply spend the entire time leading them to learn how to call on the name of the Lord and how to pray-read the word. It is not too hard, but it depends on your practice. You yourself must be a person who calls upon the name of the Lord and who pray-reads the Word. If you are such a person, it will be so easy. Begin to lead them to call on the name of the Lord with you. You do it first, by exercising your spirit to say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Do not say in a common way with no exercise of the spirit, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, thank You. Thank You I am here to help this friend.&rdquo; This does not work. You have to call from the depths of your being, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus, thank You. Lord Jesus!&rdquo; They may only listen to you at first, but you must do it. Then direct them to do it. Every human being is a follower. When one comes to the United States from another country and stays here for twenty years, he will learn many American things, because there are so many Americans to follow.</p>
<p>When you enter into a home, you must be one with such a character that everyone would be subdued by you. You must take the role of influencing the entire family. This could be accomplished only by the Holy Spirit. Even if you are quiet by nature, when you look at them your eyes should be very convincing. We all have to learn this. Then you could pray-read and call on the name of the Lord. Your calling will be subduing, and they will follow you. You do not even need to ask them to follow you. If you say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; they will say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and they will improve their calling. If you do not know how to call, you must go home and practice calling. The more practice you have, the more effective you will be. Then when you go out, you will subdue people. You will look at them, and your look will subdue them. When you open up your mouth, your calling will subdue them, and they will follow and go along with you. Then you could open up Matthew 4:4 and begin to pray-read: &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; Give them a short word; then go on to pray-read, &ldquo;Oh, every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God! Oh, the word, the word, that proceeds out through the mouth of God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first thing you have to lead them to do is to call on the Lord. The second thing is to lead them not only to eat the word of God but to masticate it. Do not merely teach them. Teaching alone does not work so well. Rather, you have to take the lead to do it. This will convince and subdue them, and they will spontaneously learn to follow you. In one visit you will bring them into calling and pray-reading. The new converts should learn to masticate the word by pray-reading the Bible verses quoted in our publications. In the beginning it is better to use the <em>New Life Lessons.</em> There are many crucial verses there.</p>
