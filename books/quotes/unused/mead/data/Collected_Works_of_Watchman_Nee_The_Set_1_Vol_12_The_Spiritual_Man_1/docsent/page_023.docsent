   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION TWO THE FLESH CHAPTER ONE THE FLESH AND SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word flesh is basar in Hebrew and sarx in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This word is often seen in the Bible and is used in various senses, but chiefly in reference to an unregenerated person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we take a look at what Paul has said, we shall have a clear insight into its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said, "I am fleshy" Rom 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was not only his nature or merely any one part of his being which was fleshy; it was "I" as a person, the whole being of Paul was fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 18, in further clarification of his meaning, he declared, "In me, that is, in my flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is very clear here that the flesh in biblical usage refers to all that is in man when he is still in an unregenerated state.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apart from such usage, it is sometimes used 1 in reference to the flesh of the human body, that is the soft part of the body besides the blood and the bones; 2 to denote the human body itself; and 3 to denote all the people of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These several different connotations are interlinked one with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the beginning man was created a tripartite being, consisting of spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The soul, as man's personality and feeling, on the one hand, affiliates with the physical world through the body, and on the other hand, affiliates with the spiritual realm through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the soul has to decide whether to submit to the spirit, so as to be identified with God and His will, or to yield to the body and all the temptations of the material world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the fall of man, the soul rejected the authority of the spirit and became enslaved to the body and its lustful desires.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is how man became fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since the spirit has lost its noble position and become a captive, and the soul is subjected to the power of the body, man is regarded in the Bible as being fleshy, even as having become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the soul is subjected to the flesh as its bondservant, so all that is of the soul has become of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1 The human body consists, as it is, of flesh, bones, and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Flesh is that part of the body which is full of consciousness, and it is through the flesh that we receive our feelings of the physical world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A fleshy person is therefore one who follows after his world-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What the flesh consists of is not "flesh" alone, although it includes "flesh," but also the man who walks after the consciousness of the "flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2 The human body, whether dead or living, is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in the spiritual sense, "flesh" refers to the body which is alive, and the life that makes the body alive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the passage quoted below from Romans 7, we know that there exists a relationship between the sins of the flesh and the body of man: "But I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members" v. 23 . In chapter eight the apostle goes on to discuss how one can overcome the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He says that if you wish to overcome the flesh, you need to put to death the practices of the body "by the Spirit" v. 13 . Although the flesh consists of the soul and the body, there is nevertheless a particular connection between the "flesh" and the physical flesh, that is the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Consequently, the Bible uses the word sarx in speaking of the flesh in the physical sense, and employs the same word in speaking of the flesh in the sense of the psyche.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3 Whatever there is in man is born of the flesh, and for that cause he is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No man in the world is regarded by the Bible as non-fleshly for all men are subjected to the control of the flesh comprising the soul and the body .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They all walk after the sins of the body and the self of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So when referring to all men, the Bible does not say all men but "all flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since all men are fleshly, the word sarx is used in speaking of the carnality of man as well as of man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>HOW DOES MAN BECOME FLESHLY?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From this we can see that the Lord is speaking of three things: 1 What is flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2 How does man become flesh? and 3 What is the nature of flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"That which is born of the flesh is flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Who then is born of the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So man is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whatever a man may have inborn in him or may have derived from nature when he was born of his parents is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However good he is, however virtuous he may be, whatever talents he may have, or however kind and intelligent he may be, he is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Regardless of how bad, how unholy, how foolish, how useless, or how cruel he may be, he is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That man is flesh means that all that a man inherits by birth, whatever it may be whether good or bad is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever is inherited by him at birth, although it is only in its embryonic form and is later developed and becomes fully grown, is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How does man become flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"That which is born of the flesh is flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man does not become fleshly by learning or practicing to be bad.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man is fleshly not because he sins gradually and becomes fleshly in due course of time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A fleshly man need not necessarily be one who is given to the indulgences of the flesh or one who does what pleases him and is completely controlled, suppressed, and subjugated by the evil desires of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus said man is flesh the very moment he is born.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So, to determine whether a man is fleshly, we need not look at his conduct or disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is sufficient to take only one thing into account, and that is, of whom was he born?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All men are begotten of human parents; therefore, they are born of man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every man on earth is born according to the manner of men; that is, every human being is begotten of man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, in the sight of God, all men, without exception, are flesh Gen 6:3 , and on this account God on numerous occasions does not refer to men as men in the Bible, but to all men as "all flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since all men are born of the flesh, can there possibly be anyone who is not the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>So, in view of the Lord's word, whether man is of the flesh is not dependent on any consideration other than whether he is born of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Man becomes flesh because he is begotten of blood, of the will of the flesh, and of the will of man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is not his behavior or his parents' conduct that determines the kind of person he is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is the nature of the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"That which is born of the flesh is flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In any case, he who is born of the flesh is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Educate him, reform him, cultivate him, regulate him with morality and religion all these will not make him non-flesh, because that which is born of the flesh is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since he is born of the flesh, he is flesh and will remain as flesh, regardless of the amount of work or energy spent on him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If he is to be other than flesh, he has to be born otherwise than of the flesh, and since it is through the flesh that he is born, he will always and forever be flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Nothing further need be said if man is not born of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if he is, then neither by any human means nor by the power of God or miracles can he be changed into something other than flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus said man "IS" flesh, and the matter is settled for all time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The question of whether man is fleshly lies not in the man himself, but as is stated in the foregoing paragraphs, in of whom he is born, of what he is born.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If he is born of the flesh, whatever programs may be employed to make him change will be of no avail, for he may change from one condition to another, and for that matter change from day to day, but he is still flesh, no matter how much he has changed outwardly or what condition he has changed into.</S>
