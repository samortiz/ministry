<h2 class=head2>The Church as the Body of Christ in the Triune God</h2><p>It is in this Triune God that we are all regenerated, transformed, composed, and built up as a Body for Christ with humanity mingled with divinity. This is a real wonder! In order to understand the church, we have to know the church in the way of one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body (4:4-6). How can fallen people be the Body? It is by faith and baptism (v. 5). By faith we believe into the Triune God, and by baptism we are separated from the old things. However, we are still in the old creation with an old body, so we also need one hope of our calling (v. 4).<p>The one God is in the one Lord, the one Lord is the one Spirit, and the one Spirit is in the one Body. Now we share in this one Body by faith and baptism. This is the reason that everyone must believe in the Lord Jesus and be baptized. To believe in the Lord Jesus is to be identified with Christ and united with Him. To be baptized is to be buried, to have a clearance, a complete severance from the old living, the old creation, and all old matters. It is by faith and baptism that we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ. In this way we become the Body of the Triune God. However, we need something more because we still live in the old creation. In our spirit we are in the new creation, but our old body still remains in the old creation. Therefore, we hope in one thing—that Christ will return to saturate our body. By His life He will swallow up death, and by the newness of life He will swallow up all the oldness of the old creation. This is our hope. All the above verses show us the church in the Triune God, which is the aim of God’s eternal purpose.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN, THE BODY, THE FULLNESS, THE BRIDE, THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD, AND THE WARRIOR</h2><p>Now we may see what the church is in God’s intention. This is the third main point in Ephesians. In Ephesians there are at least seven different titles assigned to the church. First, it is the church and the new man. Ephesians 2:15 tells us that Christ created one new man in Himself out of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles. Our natural concept may be that the new man is an individual. Accordingly, we may think that there are many new men. However, the new man is not an individual man but a corporate man, because verse 15 says that it was created from two peoples.<p>Strictly speaking, when 4:22-24 says to put off the old man and put on the new man, it refers to the Body. We know this from 2:15b-16a, which says, “He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace, and might reconcile both in one Body.” This indicates that the one new man is the one Body, and the one Body is the one new man. The church is the new man, and this new man is the Body of Christ.<p>According to 1:23, this Body is also the fullness of the One who fills all in all. In addition, the church is the bride, the counterpart, of Christ, just as Eve was the counterpart to Adam (Eph. 5:23-32; Gen. 2:21-25). These four aspects of the church—the new man, the Body, the fullness, and the bride—form a group. The new man is the Body, the Body is the fullness, and the fullness is the counterpart. Besides these four aspects, the church is also God’s habitation, His dwelling place in spirit (Eph. 2:21-22), and the soldier, the warrior (6:10-20). The warrior is not an army but a corporate Body to put on the whole armor of God. The whole armor of God is one item and not many. The one Body is one person that wears the whole armor.
