   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Second Way to Hell:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Refusing to Remove One's Sins</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us read a few verses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And if your hand stumbles you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands and go away into Gehenna, into unquenchable fire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And if your foot stumbles you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And if your eye stumbles you, cast it out; it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into Gehenna, where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched" Mark 9:43-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus clearly tells us another way for us to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the hand to stumble us means for the hand to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Cutting off the hand does not mean that we physically cut off the hand, it means to remove the sins and lusts of our hand which is in a way like removing our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is painful to cut off one's hand; it is surely something that we do not want to do and are unwilling to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the same way, it is also very painful to remove the lusts and sins of the hands; to do so requires us to act contrary to our natural inclination.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In spite of this, we will face great woes if we have pity on our hand, that is, pity on the lusts and the sins represented by our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only do our hands sin, but our feet also sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even our eyes and our whole body sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The hands, the feet, and the eyes are but a few parts representing our whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How often our hands sin!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have done many things that we ought not to have done.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have neglected many things that we ought to have done.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone please raise up your right hand now.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now put your right hand before you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Look at your hand!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please look!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fix your eyes upon it!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While you are looking at your hand, ask yourself and consider quietly what your hand has done.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How many sins has this hand of yours committed?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How many things has it done that were contrary to God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How many damaging things has your hand done to others?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How many things has it done to offend yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please look at your hand!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Please consider all the things that your hand has done.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At this time I hope you will lament and weep for your own sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You should not be jubilant or careless.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You should lament and weep for all the sins that your hand has committed, so that you will be willing to remove them and be saved by believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At this time please also consider the way that your feet have walked!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How many times have your feet led you to places that you should not have gone?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How many sins have your feet committed?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are your feet standing on the way to destruction and toward the gate of destruction?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are you going downhill all the time?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Are you going to wait until there is no more hope for you to turn back?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sinners, turn back!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why perish?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why take the way of sin?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not the way of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is very painful for you to walk on this way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why not remove your sins today and come to Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I implore you to turn back and to take the other way, the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What about our eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The eyes are our inner world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are the most important organ in contacting the outside world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through the eyes we transmit everything that is outside into our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What things are our eyes sending into us?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our eyes have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our eyes cause us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With the eyes we have seen many magazines and pictures that we should not have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What we call a love for literature is in fact a craving for novels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What we call an appreciation of art is in fact a love for obscene drawings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How our eyes love to see many lust-arousing scenes!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Alas, the sins of the eyes are beyond our imagination!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eve saw the loveliness of the forbidden fruit and committed the sin of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>David saw Bathsheba bathing and committed the sin of adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Have your eyes sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You know and God knows!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is a difficult thing to remove the sins of the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But the difficulty does not lie in our inability to remove them, because the Lord Jesus has prepared a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The difficulty lies in our unwillingness to remove them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It hurts our heart to have them removed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How we love our feet of sin!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How natural it is for our feet to walk on the way of sin!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How comfortable it is!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How depressing it would be if we were not able to walk according to the old way!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There would be nothing to entertain us anymore!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The heart is unwilling to turn its eyes from filthy things!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One look or one glance satisfies the lust and makes the heart feel good!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You say that it is hard to remove the sins of the hands, the feet, and the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Actually, you are unwilling to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All right, no one will force you and no one can coerce you to remove your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But God's verdict is set.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He says that those who are not born again cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Those who are not regenerated cannot enter into God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You can treasure the sins of your hands, your feet, and your eyes; you can treasure all your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You can choose not to remove them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You can embrace your sins in your bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But one thing is certain: a sinner cannot enter the kingdom of God!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A sinner cannot inherit eternal life!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Either you suffer the temporary pain of cutting off your sins to receive eternal life and enter God's kingdom, or you will keep your sins, being at ease and happy in this world, but headed toward hell to be eaten by the worms and burned by the fire in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Either remove your sins and be saved or go to perdition with your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You have to remove your sins to go on in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You do not have to plan to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You can continue to sin, enjoying the pleasure of sins and continuing in the comfort of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There is no sin in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Those who want to go in cannot bring sin along with them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Sins are either left on the mount of Golgotha, or taken to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Heaven only allows saved sinners to enter in. Sinners, never think that you can go in and bring your sins along as well.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Either you leave the sins outside and go in by yourself, or both you and your sins will be barred from entering in!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The gate of hell is wide, and its security is loose.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If you want to go to hell, you can bring any kind of sins along!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Pride, jealousy, rivalry, adultery, filth, and thousands of untold sins can easily go in with you.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Hell is not afraid of having too many sins; it only complains about not having enough sins!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If you want to go to hell, you can sin.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Hell will not drive you away because you have sinned too much.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Hell is specialized in receiving great and evil sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It has never closed its gate to those who want to go in!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It welcomes anyone who wants to go in. If you want to go there to suffer an eternal suffering and receive the punishment of God's wrath, I can tell you that you can sin at will; you can do whatever pleases your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Otherwise, you must remove your sins and trust in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>You should remove the sins of your hands, the sins of your feet, and the sins of your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>O evil ones, are you willing to stop your sin today?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Perhaps some of you who are sitting here this hour are preparing yourselves for the sin you plan to commit when you leave the meeting hall in the next hour.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Let me warn you.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Be careful!</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Be careful!</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If you are not careful, you will go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If a sinner departs from the way of sins to return to Jehovah, Jehovah will receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Once a house was on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The house was well-built, and the columns were made from long, large pieces of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>When the house caught on fire, one person inside found out too late.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He did not try to run downstairs to escape until after the fire had become very large.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Then he ran downstairs.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>While he was running across the hall, a stone column fell as a result of the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The stone column knocked the man to the floor and trapped one of his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The man tried to get up, but the stone was too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>One of his hands was trapped beneath; he could not turn and could not pull himself out!</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>He tried to call for help, but no one came to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Eventually the fire came!</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>If he did not escape, he would be burned to death, and there would never be another chance to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>He tried very hard to remove the stone, but the weighty stone was too heavy for him to move.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>He tried to pull his hand out by force, but the heavy stone made it impossible for him to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Then the fire came!</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>If he did not run, there would be no chance!</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>He saw some scattered splinters of rock that had fallen off from the column next to him.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>With his free hand he picked out a particularly sharp piece of rock and first cut off the sleeve around the hand that was trapped.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Then he began to cut his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>He was bleeding, and he felt much pain!</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>But he had to save his life.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>He had to do this!</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Life was more important.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>What is a hand compared with life?</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>If he did not suffer pain for a moment, he would lose the whole body because of one limb.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>In the end he even cut the bone of his hand with the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>With his unhurt hand, he embraced the cut limb and ran out.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Once he was outside, he fainted and fell on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Then others sent him to the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>After a few months, his limb healed.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>One trapped hand took away his freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>When he cut off the trapped hand, he was able to run for his life.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>He lost one hand, but he saved his life.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>The fire of hell is approaching!</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>You are now in a desperate situation.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Your hands are trapped by sins.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Even though only one member has sinned and your whole body has not sinned, the sins that this member committed are enough to take away the freedom of your whole body; it is enough to take away your whole life and burn you to death in the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>The fire of hell is approaching!</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>We are at the last five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>This is a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>In the blink of an eye, the opportunity will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>You should immediately run for life.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Otherwise, you will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Why do you let your whole body go to hell just because of your sins, the sins of one member?</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>For the sake of your whole body, you should suffer a temporary pain to remove your sins and trust in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>You will then enter into life.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Otherwise, I will have to speak an honest word to you: you can keep your two hands, but your whole body will be burned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>O men destined for hell, you can spare yourselves the pain of cutting your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>But your whole body will have to enter into hell!</S>
