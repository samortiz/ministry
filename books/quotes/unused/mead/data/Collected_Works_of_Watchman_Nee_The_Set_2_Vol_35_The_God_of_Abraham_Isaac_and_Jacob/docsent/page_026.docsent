   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECOND TEST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAYING FOR THE HOUSE OF ABIMELECH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abraham passed his first test.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The bringing forth of Ishmael with his fleshly strength was over.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Humanly speaking, he had done everything, and Isaac should have been born.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But before the incident in chapter seventeen was barely completed, another came along, and he was tested a second time concerning the matter of his son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Genesis 20:1 says, "And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Abraham committed the same mistake as he did in Egypt when he called Sarah his sister.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After he was rebuked by Pharaoh of Egypt, God brought him back.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But in chapter twenty he went to Abimelech of Gerar and committed the same mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is difficult for us to understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How could he fall to such a low state after he had reached the peak of fellowship in chapter eighteen?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter twenty relates something that was not mentioned in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abimelech rebuked Abraham, saying, "What hast thou done unto us?...What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Abraham said, "Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the root of this matter was not in Egypt, but in Mesopotamia.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His failure in Egypt only exposed the root.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The root of failure was in Mesopotamia.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, when he went to Gerar, the same thing happened again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God dealt with Abraham in order to show him that he and Sarah could not be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Mesopotamia he thought that he and Sarah could be separated, and that during times of peril the couple could become brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Abraham was standing on the ground of faith, while Sarah was standing on the ground of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On man's side, it is faith, and on God's side, it is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Faith and grace can never be separated from each other; they must always be together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If grace is taken away, there is no faith, there is no people of God, and Christ cannot be brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But Abraham thought that he could be separated from Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The root was planted in Mesopotamia and exposed in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now it was exposed again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God was removing the root that had been planted in Mesopotamia.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If this matter had not been taken care of, Isaac could not have been brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order for God's people to maintain His testimony, there is the need for faith and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not enough to have faith alone, and it is not enough to have grace alone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God showed Abraham that he could not sacrifice Sarah and could not be separated from her.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is interesting that "the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife" v. 18 . After Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, "Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children" v. 17 . After this incident, Sarah begot Isaac in chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The women in the house of Abimelech could not bear children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why did they bear children again when Abraham prayed and God healed them?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Others could have prayed for this, but Abraham's own wife had never borne a child.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How could he pray for the women in the house of Abimelech?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was indeed a difficult thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in this matter, the root which Abraham had planted in Mesopotamia was dug out by God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He realized that for his wife to bear children was something entirely up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While he was praying for the house of Abimelech, probably he did not have any confidence at all in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His confidence was in God and not in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now Abraham was fully delivered from himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He did not have a son, yet he could pray for others to bear children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His flesh had truly been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the second test Abraham went through concerning his son.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He learned the lesson from this test that God is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although his wife and the women in Abimelech's house were the same and could not bear children, he prayed for the women of Abimelech's house.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He did it because he knew that God is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He knew that power comes from God and not from himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If God wants to do something, He can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>With Him nothing is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Abraham had to pay a price to pray for the women of Abimelech's house.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The price was himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What he prayed for was what he himself sought after.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God was asking him to pray for something that he had not had for his whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God was touching him on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, in praying for the women of Abimelech's house, Abraham ceased all activities of his self.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only one who did not think about himself and did not consider himself could have prayed for the women of Abimelech's house on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank the Lord that God brought Abraham to the point where he could truly look away from himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He could do this because he knew God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to remember that there are two meanings to the name Father.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God is our Father, and His relationship with the believers is a father-son relationship; this is very intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is something which many Christians realize at the time of their regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But there is still another lesson we have to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God is the Father in the persons of the Trinity; everything is of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the meaning of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is the Father of everything, the Father of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the other meaning of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Abraham learned this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He could pray for the women of Abimelech's house, not because he had clusters of children in his house, but because he saw that God is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Through the begetting of Ishmael, Abraham learned to know God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In this incident with Abimelech, he learned to know God as the Father once again.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, after this incident, God fulfilled His promise to Abraham and brought forth Isaac.</S>
