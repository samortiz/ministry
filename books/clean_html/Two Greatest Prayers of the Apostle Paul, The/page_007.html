<h2 class=head2>The Freedom of Glory</h2><p>We do have a hope as a result of our being called by God. This hope is that we will be transformed and transfigured, thoroughly conformed to the image of Christ. When we look at ourselves, we realize that we have many flaws. Physically, I have many wrinkles and spots. But one day, we will all be the same as Christ, not only inwardly, spiritually, but even outwardly, physically. We will be absolutely like Christ in His glory (1 John 3:2; Col. 3:4). Today, Christ in us is our hope of glory (Col. 1:27). But one day, all my wrinkles and spots will be gone. I cannot tell you how wonderful, beautiful, and glorious we will be! Today, because we are still under corruption, we groan in ourselves (Rom. 8:23), waiting eagerly for that day of glory when we will be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (v. 21). We will be delivered out of groaning to enjoy the freedom of glory. This is our hope, our destiny, and also our destination. Day by day, we are marching onward toward this destination. Our hope is that, one day, we will arrive. This destination is not the heavens, but the freedom of the glory of the children of God. When we are all fully conformed to the image of Christ, we will be in glory. Today, I am fully content to be in the church life. In the church, we are on our way to glory, and this glory is the hope of our calling.<h2 class=head1>GOD’S INHERITANCE IN THE SAINTS</h2><p>The second matter that Paul prays for us to know is “the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints” (Eph. 1:18). We have seen that God’s inheritance in the saints is the Christ that has been wrought into us. Actually, the Christ that has been wrought into us is the church, so the church is God’s inheritance. This matter is very deep and profound. Do not think that the church is an organization, a group of religious people, or any kind of social or religious entity. The church is simply Christ wrought into us in a corporate way.<h2 class=head1>THE TRANSMISSION OF GOD’S POWER PRODUCING THE CHURCH</h2><p>The third matter that the apostle prays for us to see is “the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe” (v. 19). We must pay attention to the short phrase, toward us, in this verse. This great power is not something which is unrelated to us. This power is toward us. Continually, this great power is directed toward us who believe. We are the object of this power.<p>We should never forget the four items which constitute this power. First, it is the power that raised up Jesus from among the dead (v. 20), the resurrection power. Second, it is the power that seated Christ at the right hand of God (vv. 20-21), the transcending power. It cannot be held down, suppressed, or oppressed; it transcends everything. Third, this power subjected all things under the feet of Christ (v. 22). This is the subduing power. Fourth, it is the power that gave Christ to be Head over all things (v. 22). This is the overruling power that rules over everything. We have to realize this power in all of these aspects. This great power is the resurrection, transcending, subduing, and overruling power, and it is this power that produces the church.<h2 class=head2>Experiencing the Divine Transmission</h2><p>In verse 19, this great power is “toward us who believe.” To receive God’s power, there is no other condition than that of believing in the Lord Jesus. As long as you believe in the Lord Jesus, this power is toward you and even in you. Then verse 22 says that Christ has been given to be Head over all things to the church. This word “to” indicates a transmission. Here we have a divine transmission of all the power which God has wrought in Christ into the church. Although we may see this, it could be merely a doctrine to us. We must also see how to apply it.<p>To experience this power, the first thing we need to realize is that this power is in us already. It is just like the electricity that has already been installed into a building. But with most of us, our “amperage” is too low. Our capacity to receive the transmission of this power is too small. This power has been installed into us, but because our capacity is too small, many times in our experience “the fuse burns out,” and the power does not work. We must all look to the Lord that our capacity may be enlarged that we may experience the power that is within us.
