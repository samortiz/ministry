   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having the Spirit of Faith</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 13 Paul says, And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The same spirit refers to the same spirit as set forth in the quotation from Psalm 116:10.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Concerning the spirit in verse 13, Alford says, Not distinctly the Holy Spirit, but still not merely a human disposition: the indwelling Holy Spirit penetrates and characterizes the whole renewed man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Vincent says, Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means it is the mingling of the Holy Spirit with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak, as the psalmist did, the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Doubts are in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The spirit here indicates that it is by the mingled spirit that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection for carrying out their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 14 says, Knowing that He Who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the apostles considered themselves dead persons 1:9 , for they were always being delivered unto death for the Lord s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their only hope was in the God who raised up the Lord Jesus and who would also raise them up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They lived with this kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 15 Paul declares, For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, abounding through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Grace, according to the context, is the very Christ who lives in the apostles as their life and life supply for them to live a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life, that they may carry out their ministry for God s new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the apostles were under the killing, life was being imparted to others, and grace was abounding through the many.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result, much thanksgiving will also abound.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul did not care for the sufferings, because he realized that his being killed imparted life to many and this life became grace to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, all will give thanks to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was the life lived by the apostles, a crucified life for the manifestation of resurrection life by the excellent power of the hidden treasure in the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sooner or later, we shall all experience the grinding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We shall be ground between the top stone and the bottom stone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this matter we have no choice, for we all need the grinding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is this grinding that causes resurrection life to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yes, in the sight of God we have already been constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we still need the testing to determine how much we have been constituted, and we also need the grinding to work out this constitution in a practical and experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we have been constituted, we still need this constitution to be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is done mainly through opposition and the grinding of the dear ones close to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every church is a grinding mill. Perhaps you do not like the church in your locality and desire to move elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you move to escape the grinding, you will find that in the place to which you move you will be ground even more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, if you move to escape the grinding, you should be prepared for even more grinding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot avoid it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This has been ordained for us; it is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord for the grinding which causes the resurrection life to be manifested!</S>
