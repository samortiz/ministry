   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE SIXTY THE NEW JERUSALEM 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The meaning of Revelation 21 and 22 has been hidden from Christians for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many have understood these chapters in a very natural way and have considered them a description of a material city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we were young, we heard gospel songs about the golden city and the golden street.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first verse of the book of Revelation says that the revelation of Jesus Christ is made known by signs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we would understand this book, we must know the meaning of all the signs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, the seven golden lampstands in chapter one and the universal bright woman in chapter twelve are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, in this book Christ is called the Lion and the Lamb, terms which also are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In like manner, the entire city of New Jerusalem is a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Throughout the centuries, what Christians have spoken about the church has come out of their mistaken concept of what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When some talk about going to church, they refer to a bungalow with a high tower and a bell.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In their concept, a certain kind of building is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even some diagrams of the dispensations use the figure of a building with a steeple to represent the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although such a thing may be a chapel, it certainly is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Brethren, who were raised up in the last century, have an improved understanding of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To them, the church is not a building; it is the gathering of the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When believers meet together, their gathering is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although this understanding is correct, it is rather shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is much deeper than this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose a thousand regenerated Christians meet together; yet they quarrel, fight, criticize one another, and live in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Is that the church?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No, it is neither the church nor a gathering of the saints; in the eyes of God it is a gathering of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In one meeting of a certain church board, one member of the board even threw a Bible at another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a gathering certainly is not a meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the last book of the Bible the church is signified by a bright, pure, shining golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord uses a lampstand to symbolize the church because the church is deep and mysterious and cannot adequately be described in human language.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, the Lord was forced to use a sign, a symbol, to represent it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you see that the church is a golden lampstand, you will know what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if you are asked to define the church, you still may not be able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is mysterious, divine, and pure, and human words cannot define it adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, nowhere in the New Testament do we find a full definition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ephesians 1:22 and 23 say that the church is Christ s Body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But what does the word fullness mean, and what does it mean to fill all in all ?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is difficult to understand the term church, much less the terms Body, fullness, and all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, in the book of Revelation, the ultimate conclusion of the Bible, many signs are used to convey spiritual realities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we say that the church is a golden lampstand, we do not mean that the church is actually a stand with seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a mistake to understand the matter this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is the same with the description of Christ as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Certainly our Lord is not literally a lamb with four legs and a tail.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How wrong to understand biblical symbols in this way!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lamb is a sign indicating something concerning the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, when the book of Revelation pictures the church as the golden lampstand, it means that the church is divine and pure; the church also has a light that shines in the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the significance and the true meaning of the church being a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The city of New Jerusalem is also a sign, an all-inclusive sign.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to understand this sign, our mind must be completely renewed and enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must not understand the New Jerusalem according to our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some argue that New Jerusalem is actually a square, material city.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have this kind of natural concept, we shall not be able to understand the New Jerusalem as a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The New Jerusalem is a sign signifying God s eternal building as His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be sure, God s eternal building is not a physical place; rather it is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead of being a material city, it is an entity constituted with His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is so mysterious, deep, and profound that human language cannot adequately describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, in His wisdom, God uses a picture, a sign, to reveal it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With this principle in mind, let us now consider the various details and aspects of the city of New Jerusalem.</S>
