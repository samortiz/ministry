   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE APOSTLE PAUL S PERFECT EXAMPLE AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIGH STANDARD IN ANNOUNCING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Testament revelation concerning the announcing of the gospel gives us a very high standard and a perfect example in the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Chosen to Be a Vessel</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, this announcer was chosen by God to be a vessel not a carrier but a vessel to contain Christ Acts 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you go out to contact people with the intention of announcing the gospel, you must realize that you are a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ cannot be carried by you as something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ must be contained within you as your contents.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then you, the vessel, become one with the contents.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When you go to contact people, that is Christ going.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You are His vessel to convey Him to people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. Appointed to Be a Minister</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>and a Witness of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul was appointed to be a minister and a witness of Christ Acts 26:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A minister is one who serves others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you are going to announce the gospel, you must be a servant to serve others with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A waiter in a restaurant is a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He ministers the food of the restaurant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a rule, every waiter must also be a witness of the food.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a waiter can tell a customer that he has tasted a certain dish and that it is very nourishing and delicious, the customer will want it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to serve people with the Christ whom we have tasted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we become His witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>C. Given to Be a Steward of the Grace of God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Ephesians 3:2 Paul said he had the stewardship of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A steward is different from a waiter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the ancient custom, a steward was a general servant who directed everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A steward of a rich man knew everything concerning the rich man s house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God made Paul a steward of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here the grace equals the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The gospel is the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul was made a steward to take care of God s grace, God s gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>D. Separated unto the Gospel of God</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 1:1 says that Paul was separated unto the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Galatians 1:15 and 16 say that he was set apart by God for the gospel from the womb of his mother, before he was born.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When he grew up, he became a strong Judaizer, persecuting Christ and devastating the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One day while he was going to Damascus to arrest the callers of Jesus, he fell to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is hard for you to kick against the goads Acts 26:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A goad on a plow is a sharp pointed stick used to subdue and prod an ox yoked to the plow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord s word here signifies that Saul was already yoked to the plow and had no choice but to take the Lord s yoke obediently for the carrying out of the Lord s commission.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was as if the Lord was saying to Paul, You think you are free.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, you are yoked to My plow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have set you apart already from your mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I do not think that many of us have ever considered that God has set us apart from our mother s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all need to realize that we were set apart from our mother s womb to announce Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I was like Paul on the road to Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I was nineteen years old, I was endeavoring to advance myself by getting the proper education.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One afternoon I heard the gospel, and I was caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I gave up my expectation to get a high education.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I told the Lord, Lord, from today I want to be a poor preacher, carrying the Bible to travel through the villages and announce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am willing to eat the root of the trees and to drink the water from the hills.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To announce the gospel is not a light thing, but something very special.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>E. Commissioned as a Herald</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul said that he was commissioned as a herald 1 Tim 2:7; 2 Tim 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A herald is an official reporter.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul was such an official reporter of God s New Testament economy.</S>
