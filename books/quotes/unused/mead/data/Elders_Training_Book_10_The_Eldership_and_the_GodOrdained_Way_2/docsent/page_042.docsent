   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first test of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord in the church was the test of the problem of language.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we can see that murmurings arose because of the unequal daily dispensing of food.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even in the glorious condition of the church after the day of Pentecost, murmurings arose over the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This problem was solved by the proper service arranged by the apostles according to the practical need vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE TEST OF PETER'S CONTACT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>WITH THE GENTILES</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>ACTS 11:1-18</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the Levitical regulations Lev 11; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Acts 10:9-16, 28 , the Jews were not allowed to contact the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They considered the Gentiles unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, in Acts 10 Peter contacted the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of this, a disputation arose between the disciples of the circumcision and Peter Acts 11:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This disputation was solved by Peter's testifying of the facts according to the truth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In dealing with such disputes, we must present the facts, and these facts must be vouchsafed by the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a big problem must be solved in this way: by the presenting of facts that are fully according to the New Testament teaching, the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE TEST OF THE HERETICAL TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CONCERNING CIRCUMCISION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>AS A REQUIREMENT FOR SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>ACTS 15:1-31</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Judaizers, the Jewish believers, not only stressed the practice of circumcision, but also said that circumcision was a requirement for salvation v. 1 . This was a great heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No little dissension and discussion arose between the Judaic believers and those of the proper faith vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This problem was solved by Paul and Barnabas and certain others among the believers going to Jerusalem from Antioch to have a conference with the apostles and the elders there v. 2 . The Bible shows us that when a question like this arises, the leading ones need to come together to have a conference, to bring everything out into the open.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The problem in Acts 15 was solved by Paul and Barnabas going to Jerusalem, having a conference with the apostles and the elders there, and through thorough fellowship, working out a solution that satisfied all the believers in different localities, a solution over which all the churches rejoiced and by which they were comforted vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2, 6-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the way we should solve the problems among us today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe that if from the beginning the concerned brothers among us would have had a sincere heart with a pure motive to come together to pray, to study the Word, and to fellowship, their concerns would have been easily taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, until now the brothers have been avoiding this kind of necessary fellowship.</S>
