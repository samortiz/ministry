[1]  WITNESSING Scripture Reading: Acts 9:19-21; 22:15; 1 John 4:14; John 1:40-45; 4:29; Mark 5:19 I. THE MEANING OF WITNESSING
[2]  In Mark 5:1-20 we see a person who was demon possessed.
[3]  After the demon possessed man was saved, the Lord said to him, "Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you" v. 19 .
[4]  After you are saved, the Lord wants you to tell your family, neighbors, relatives, friends, and colleagues that you are now a saved person.
[5]  You should tell them not only that you have believed in Jesus but also what great things the Lord has done for you.
[6]  Everyone in this world knows that there is a Jesus.
[7]  But they only know Jesus as one among millions of men in this world.
[8]  When a person receives the Lord Jesus as his Savior and confesses Him as the Son of God, he is doing a great thing, a tremendous thing.
[9]  If you realize how great the discovery you have made is and how important and wonderful your discovery is, you surely will tell others immediately, "I have met the Son of God."
[10]  When Peter told the Lord, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Lord Jesus told him, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" Matt 16:16-17 .
[11]  A person needs not only to go to the city, to his home, and to the synagogues to witness to others about his faith in the Lord, but also to bear a special testimony to lead others to the Lord one on one.
[12]  The moment Andrew believed in the Lord, he led his brother Peter to the Lord.
[13]  Philip and Nathanael were friends; Philip first believed in the Lord and later led his friend to receive the Lord.
[14]  Although he did not have any special gift and did not know how to lead many people to the Lord, the Lord was gracious to him and opened his eyes to realize that he could lead at least one person to the Lord.
[15]  The two happiest days in every believer's life are the day he believes in the Lord and the day when, for the first time, he leads another person to Christ.
[16]  Many Christians do not have much joy because they have never spoken anything for the Lord; they have never led a person to the Lord.
[17]  Many people have not heard the gospel because you have not yet testified to them.
[18]  As soon as a person believes in the Lord, he should make a resolution before the Lord to lead men to the Lord.
