[1]  3 Thyatira The Roman Catholic Church Sub-Section Four Sardis The Reformed Church Sub-Section Five Philadelphia The Faithful Little Flock Sub-Section Six Laodicea The Apostate Church Sub-Section Seven
[2]  Verse 18:"And to the messenger of the church in Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, He who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like shining bronze."
[3]  We have seen how the church in Ephesus represents the church after the time of the apostles, how Smyrna represents the suffering church after this, and how Pergamos represents the corrupted church that was welcomed by the Roman emperor.
[4]  As such He is sitting on the throne of His Father.
[5]  Having seen this, we will realize the preciousness of the name of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God.
[6]  He uses this name in order to show the saints in the apostate Thyatira the rich grace He has reserved for them.
[7]  All those who follow the teaching of Jezebel receive but death and bondage.
[8]  Although this title serves as a warning to the apostate church, it serves equally as a reminder of the Lord's power to His faithful children.
[9]  However, we have to know that although the Lord Jesus reveals Himself as the Son of God here, His intention was not to reveal Himself as the Son of God who gives life and freedom, but the Son of God who executes judgment.
[10]  Verse 19:"I know your works and love and faith and service and your endurance and that your last works are more than the first."
[11]  Although they suffered, labored, and were threatened and persecuted, although they suffered much more than those under the Roman emperors suffered, although they did not witness any miracles and wonders or have any organization or group to back them up, and although the people and the priests of the time invented many condemnations against them, they marched on fearlessly to maintain God's testimony and were willing to sacrifice all comfort, their families, lives, and everything in the world to testify for the Son of God that the power of Hades would not be able to overcome the church.
[12]  Verse 20:"But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices."
[13]  If we are willing to allow the Scripture itself to expound the meaning of this parable, we will see that every point in this parable is very meaningful.
[14]  From Leviticus 2 we can find the help to explain this parable.
[15]  It should not contain any leaven v. 11 . Hence, the crucial point here is that the woman has done something that God has forbidden.
[16]  The teachings of Christ have fallen into the hand of this woman.
[17]  She has the power to turn and upset them at will.
[18]  She can add to them her traditions and ordinances so that these latter become as authoritative as the word of God.
[19]  Whatever teachings they are, wherever they are found, and with whatever outward appearance they come, they always quench the Holy Spirit, offend the teaching of God's Word, and set up another master other than the Lord Jesus Christ.
[20]  Verses 21-23:"And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication.
[21]  Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works; and her children I will kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works."
[22]  This is the way the persecutors of God's people receive their rightful judgment from the hands of God.
[23]  Although the prophets can prophesy, all the others must "discern" 1 Cor 14:29 .
[24]  Many times we are inclined to listen to man's philosophy and traditional teachings, but God's intention is to break us away from these things so that we may come afresh before His word and hear the teaching of the Bible.
[25]  They never consider that before the Lord Jesus came, Satan was already the prince of this age and that everything that this age does is opposed to God and His Son Christ.
[26]  Those who committed fornication with her still have a little chance and a little opportunity for repentance, but if they lose that opportunity and will not repent, they will suffer "great tribulation."
[27]  This tribulation is surely not for this life only.
[28]  Romans 2 says: "Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who commits evil...In the day when God judges the secrets of men according to my gospel through Jesus Christ" vv.
[29]  Verses 24-25: "But I say to you the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say I put no other burden upon you; nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come."
[30]  Our hearts are truly comforted at hearing the Lord's word to the faithful ones in such dark situations.
[31]  If there is a place in which a church is purely meeting in the Lord's name, if that church not denomination is the only church in that locality, if that church is the church of God in that locality, and if that church has not acted contrary to the scriptural teaching of God but has acknowledged the freedom for the Holy Spirit to work among it, we cannot depart from it just because it is corrupt.
[32]  Verses 26-28:"And he who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father; and to him I will give the morning star."
[33]  These overcomers in the church should bear three characteristics.
[34]  First, they should hold fast to what they have and should walk a pathway that is separated from the world in the midst of various persecutions, oppositions, and corruptions.
[35]  Paul warned the saints before that it is untimely exaltation for one to reign at the present time 1 Cor 4:8-14 .
[36]  At present, we should humble ourselves under the hand of the rulers Rom 13:1 and should wait until the Lord gives us the authority to reign Rom 14:17 .
[37]  The authority over the nations as mentioned here by the Lord is, of course, the same as that mentioned in Revelation 20:4.
[38]  What the Lord is telling us here is that not only will the martyrs reign, those who hold fast to the works of Christ will also have a share in the kingdom and will reign.
[39]  Those who will have authority over the nations are not all the saved Christians in Thyatira, nor are they the Christians who hold fast initially to the works of Christ, nor are they the Christians who have received initial commendations from Christ.
[40]  Although man's fortresses are strong now, and although those who oppose God and His Son Christ are adamant in their attitude, on that day they will all be broken to pieces by Christ, and like vessels of pottery they will not be able to withstand the iron rod.
[41]  In chapter nineteen, when we see Christ coming from the air, "out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod; and He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty" v. 15 . This is not the gospel! This is the might of Christ! The nations will become the Lord's inheritance, and the end of the earth will become the Lord's field, not through the influence of the gospel but through the establishing and the execution of His kingdom with His authority and power at His coming on this earth.
[42]  However, before the Lord's kingdom comes, the saints must first be raptured by Him.
[43]  Hence, the Lord says, "And to him I will give the morning star."
[44]  The meaning of the morning star is explained to us at the end of this book.
[45]  That will be the work of the Sun. When He said that He is the morning star, it means that He is not seen by the sleeping church and the slumbering world, for they are all glorifying themselves in the world and have forgotten about the cross of Christ and that now is the time of night.
[46]  This calling was formerly placed before the promise to the overcomers, but beginning from Thyatira, this word is placed after the promise.
[47]  In the previous three churches, it was first the calling of those who have ears to hear the words of the Holy Spirit, then the promise to the overcomers.
[48]  However, beginning from Thyatira and continuing all the way to Laodicea, it is first the promise of blessing and glory to the overcomers, then the calling of those who have an ear to hear the words of the Holy Spirit to the churches.
[49]  Verse 1:"And to the messenger of the church in Sardis write: These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead."
[50]  What is spoken of here is clearly a reference to the words in Zechariah 3:9 and 4:10.
[51]  If we pay attention to the events at the time Zechariah prophesied these words, we will see the significance of quoting his words here.
[52]  At the time the prophet prophesied this word, God had already stretched forth His hands and had delivered the Israelites out of the land of captivity in Babylon.
[53]  We see that although Jehovah turned their attention to His temple, they should have been zealous for His temple only by abiding in the coming Christ, in the Holy Spirit which dwelt among them, and in the coming glory.
[54]  Although the Lord has released His children from "Babylon the Great" and has turned them back to the Bible to apprehend the gospel of grace at the time of the Reformation, and although they have left the corruption and idolatry of the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant church has not paid attention to the seven Spirits mentioned by the Lord here.
[55]  The gifts covered in Ephesians 4 are given by the ascended Head to His Body.
[56]  The gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 are given to individual churches.
[57]  The power for the edification of the church must be given by God.
[58]  If believers are to understand God's ordained order for the church, they should differentiate between the gifts in Ephesians 4 and those in 1 Corinthians 12.
[59]  The two natures revealed here by the Lord are related.
[60]  To them, spirituality is everything if believers can grow and be mature in their spiritual life, and if they can fellowship with the Lord and walk according to God's will for individual believers without failure, the many troublesome questions concerning the denominations can be ignored: "Even the best saints cannot be in one accord concerning the administration of the church.
[61]  However, if the Lord considers church administration to be something insignificant, as they do, the Lord would not have the need to unveil Himself as the one with the seven stars.
[62]  The question in any system is whether or not the opinions of the one or the many are set aside, and whether the Lord Jesus has the full authority to direct everything in administration and meeting; whether He can use His gifts at will; whether the Holy Spirit is the "chairman" of everything; and whether His words are being honored above all human ordinances and creeds.
[63]  Although those believers who emphasize spirituality consider that their spiritual life is the most important thing and that the church administration can be carried out at random, the Lord considers that the authority of the church, like the source of spiritual life, depends fully on Him.
[64]  If believers have not acknowledged the Lord as the One with God's seven Spirits in life and have not acknowledged the Lord as the One with the seven stars in church position, they must once again hear the Lord's questioning of the church in Sardis.
[65]  Only those who recognize Christ as Lord and who work for the Lord by acknowledging His authority and administration can bear responsibility according to the Lord.
[66]  If believers acknowledge the fact that the Lord is the One with the seven stars, this will put the responsible ones in the church in a proper relationship with the Lord and a proper submission to the Lord and will preserve them from human manipulations and orders.
[67]  In this way, no work will come into conflict with another work of the Lord in another place, and believers will not be confined to the care of one locality, one nation, or one sect alone.
[68]  In spite of the condition of the church, the Lord Jesus is the One with the full power of God's Holy Spirit.
[69]  The Lord reveals Himself here as such a One with power and authority because these are the things that are lacking in the church in Sardis.
[70]  At that time, there was an organization which called itself the church and the bride of Christ, which considered itself well able to solve all problems and confessed the church as being eternally infallible, which considered one person to be the representative of Christ, who had unimaginable authority to deal with the affairs of the church and the disputes in doctrines of faith.
[71]  If we consider the example of Paul, we will see how he ignored all present failures to look single-heartedly to the Lord.
[72]  When we read 1 and 2 Corinthians and Galatians, we find how his views transcended the defeated Corinthians and the fallen Galatians.
[73]  The sin committed among the Corinthians was shocking; one committed fornication which was not even heard of among the Gentiles.
[74]  Paul had to warn them, but before he mentioned the sin, he first said, "Who the Lord will also confirm you until the end unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[75]  God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord" 1 Cor 1:8-9 .
[76]  What we believe in is not how much the church is for Christ, but how much Christ is for the church.
[77]  Since the Reformation, the disputes that we have heard among the Protestant churches are not of different views concerning the gospel.
[78]  Rather, they are on the church and the government of the church.
[79]  If in this aspect we would allow the Bible to speak instead of allowing the Protestant churches to speak, the question of church government will be as clear as the gospel is.
[80]  Whether or not we are willing to do it, we should allow the Bible to solve all problems.
[81]  If we do this, we will see that neither the teachings of Luther, the teachings of Calvin, the Anglican Church, nor the Genevan Church, has brought us back to the initial position of the church.
[82]  All these speak of the Protestant church being like Sardis, living in name, but dead in reality.
[83]  The Lord's description of their being living in name and dead in reality is a moral description of their condition.
[84]  At the same time, it is a condemnation of their sin of nationalism.
[85]  In the eyes of these persons, what is there is not the church of God, but a Christianized world in which Christ is scattered.
[86]  Sometimes this separation occurs among the most genuine Christians.
[87]  This is, of course, a sin, for believers ought not to be separated.
[88]  Yet those who are not willing to bear the cross, who are afraid of paying a high price, who have not heard God's calling, and whose hearts are not single enough to know the Lord's way of leading His people will have to bear the responsibility for this separation.
[89]  We are responsible to tell others that the Lord never leads His own children to take opposite paths.
[90]  It is possible to be diversified in our ways, but if our ways are opposite one to another, it means that some are not of the Lord.
[91]  Now the Lord can say, "Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God."
[92]  Many times, due to our single-hearted work and our untiring diligence, we lead many to Christ and receive a great following of men.
[93]  As a result, we receive a name that is living.
[94]  We may become satisfied with the people we have gathered around us and may rest in this fruit and forget the Lord of life and power.
[95]  Naturally, this makes the Lord unable to use us anymore, and we will end up with many shortcomings.
[96]  "For I have found none of your works completed before My God."
[97]  There is one pair of eyes constantly searching His churches.
[98]  What the Lord is rebuking here is not what they have done but what they have not done.
[99]  Since the Lord is only rebuking the believers in Sardis for what they have not done, it proves that their works were not dead works Heb 6:1 .
[100]  Verse 3:"Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent.
[101]  If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you."
[102]  How vain it would be if believers would forget what Christ remembers.
[103]  What God is causing us to remember is not anything that we have not received, but that which we have received.
[104]  The Lord is holding His church responsible for the grace it has received and the word it has heard.
[105]  To be watchful means that one has to preserve himself from sleep.
[106]  Unless we are drawing near to Christ, and unless we feel His searching and supervising, it is difficult for us to be watchful.
[107]  If we consider our trials in the presence of Christ, we will see that the way of deliverance is very easy, but many times when we are in the midst of the trials, we lose this view.
[108]  What God is saying here is that if one does not walk according to what the Lord has given him, and if he is not watchful but slumbers like the world does, he will suffer what the world will suffer.
[109]  The hope of the believers is the coming of the Lord 2 Thes 2:1 and not the day of the Lord v. 2 . However, if they are not watchful, they will lose the joy of the coming of the Lord and will suffer the tribulations of the day of the Lord.
[110]  Verse 4:"But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy."
[111]  The Lord knows every one of their names; He pays attention to every one of them.
[112]  Verses 5-6:"He who overcomes will be clothed thus, in white garments, and I shall by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.
[113]  Although such was the condition of the church, and although there were only a few who had not defiled themselves, the Lord still has the promise for the overcomers.
[114]  According to the two passages we just quoted, it is possible for one's name to be removed from the book of life.
[115]  Even the Scripture which we are considering now contains this meaning.
[116]  Only the overcoming saints will not have their names erased from the book of life.
[117]  Verse 7:"And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write: These things says the Holy One, the true One, the One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens."
[118]  How wonderful it is when we consider that the Lord has only praises for their situation and nothing else.
[119]  The Lord does not reveal Himself here in the same way that He revealed Himself to the other messengers.
[120]  It is what His faithful saints know Him by in His moral virtues during this period.
[121]  The question here is not one of a church satisfying the demands of a judge, but a church matching the heart and nature of the Lord.
[122]  A strict way is often lonely and without sympathy.
[123]  When one considers the forlornness of this way, he will realize that there is no great work in this way.
[124]  Not only were the people this way, even the rulers were the same.
[125]  Hence, the prophet spoke to the key person of the government at that time: "Thus says the Lord Jehovah of hosts: / Get up, go to this steward, / To Shebna, who is over the king's house, saying, / What are you doing here and whom do you have here / That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here, / As he who has hewn a tomb on the heights, / As he who has cut out a resting place for himself in the rock?
[126]  / Jehovah soon throws you far away, you mighty one, / And He grasps you firmly; / He will wind you up tightly; / Like a ball He will toss you into a wide land.
[127]  And as to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things....Now David, having served his own generation by the counsel of God, did indeed fall asleep and was buried with his fathers and saw corruption; but He whom God has raised did not see corruption" Acts 13:32-37 .
[128]  Verse 8:"I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name."
[129]  Here the Lord is not inspecting their works, but telling the suffering and weak believers that He knows their works and is satisfied with them.
[130]  Many times there may be much power without, yet within one is weak.
[131]  This is what the Holy Spirit means in 1 Corinthians 13.
[132]  No. The Lord says: "And have kept My word and have not denied My name." How does the Lord know that they have a little power? Surely it is by their keeping the Lord's word and not denying His name.
[133]  Christ's characteristics should be the characteristics of the church.
[134]  Christ said: "Thy word have I hid in mine heart" Psa 119:11 .
[135]  We have to remember that our unwillingness is often the thing that prevents us from keeping the word of Christ.
[136]  Many times we are different from other saints in some things.
[137]  We may think that it is a question of opinion and interpretation.
[138]  At the time of the apostasy and desolation of the church, it is not a small thing to not deny the Lord's name.
[139]  From the fact that the Lord was saying this in a negative way, that it was a matter of not denying His name rather than a matter of exalting His name, we know the seriousness of the apostasy at that time.
[140]  It is precious enough to not deny the Lord's name negatively.
[141]  They may not have done much work on the positive side, yet the Lord still commended them.
[142]  In a perilous age, God is not considering what His children have done for Him but what they have not done for Him.
[143]  Bible readers often notice one special characteristic of the Philadelphia believers: their eyes see only Christ Himself.
[144]  Although they are "Philadelphia" brotherly love what they love is Christ.
[145]  Because they love Christ in this way and because they love Him so personally, they are able to become "Philadelphia."
[146]  Everyone who loves Christ will have his heart enlarged to receive and accept the whole church of Christ.
[147]  "Behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut" Rev 3:8 .
[148]  Many say that if they do not accept the name of the world, the denominations, and the sects, they will have no place to work.
[149]  We have said much about the door, but according to this book, the door seems to signify more than the above.
[150]  If we study this letter carefully, we will see the importance of the prophetic nature of this letter.
[151]  Verse 9:"Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, those who call themselves Jews and are not, but lie behold, I will cause them to come and fall prostrate before your feet and to know that I have loved you."
[152]  Although the Jews still mockingly deny the Lord Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of David, and consider those who follow Christ as those following an impostor, the Lord Jesus will soon reign in the kingdom with His faithful people and will rule over the whole world on the throne.
[153]  Of course, Roman Catholicism is more seriously affected by Judaism, but the spirit of Judaism is prevailing everywhere.
[154]  Every revival and every split from a Protestant denomination unavoidably carries over the influence of the denomination out from which it came.
[155]  Verse 10:"Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."
[156]  This is the third promise, but its blessing is in no way less than the other promises.
[157]  The word of endurance here means two things: 1 the word of Christ's long endurance in waiting for His own glorification, and 2 the word of the Christian's endurance in waiting for His coming.
[158]  "The hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth."
[159]  The Old Testament prophets, the Lord Jesus Himself, and the apostle Paul all prophesied about this hour.
[160]  At that time, God said, "I will make a full end of all the nations to which I have scattered you; / But I will not make a full end of you" v. 11 . Daniel also spoke of this time: "And there will be a time of distress, such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time" Dan 12:1 . "The day of the Lord" as prophesied by the Old Testament prophets mainly refers to this day.
[161]  The goal of the gospel is to gain people from the world for Christ.
[162]  The thoughts, feelings, desires, and cravings of the saints must be upward toward the glory above.
[163]  If they are already standing on the ground of Christ's endurance, they have already forsaken the world and will need no more sifting from the world.
[164]  Verse 11:"I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown."
[165]  This word is both a consolation as well as a warning.
[166]  They have the brotherly love, the little power, the keeping of the Lord's word, the not denying of His name, and the exalting of the Lord's word of endurance now and of His coming kingship in the future.
[167]  Verse 12:"He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name."
[168]  "And he shall by no means go out anymore."
[169]  Although for Christ's sake we are standing outside the strong and orderly crowd today, in that day, we will forever be pillars in the temple of God and will go no more out.
[170]  Although the world can chase us out of the synagogue of Satan, which can mean both physically as well as spiritually driven, in the future God will put us in His temple forever.
[171]  But the Lord said that the pillars in the future temple will not suffer this anymore; they will remain there forever and will not go out anymore.
[172]  Verse 13:"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
[173]  Because this teaching is so crucial and solemn, all those who have ears should hear what Christ says in this and what the Holy Spirit says through this.
[174]  Since there is such a solemn teaching set before us, we should ask God to circumcise our ears so that we may hear.
[175]  SUB-SECTION SEVEN LAODICEA THE APOSTATE CHURCH 3:14-22 VERSE FOURTEEN
[176]  Verse 14: "And to the messenger of the church in Laodicea write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God."
[177]  Everything that God has entrusted to man and which man is responsible for has completely failed.
[178]  The word "people" is the most common word in modern politics.
[179]  Yet we have to realize that "the people" here refers to the people in the church.
[180]  From its name, we see that Laodicea is a church of people's ruling.
[181]  Philadelphia opens the way for Laodicea to come in. In Thyatira there was naturally the ruling of the Pope.
[182]  The nature of Philadelphia is to draw near to Christ, to honor Christ, and to suffer for Christ.
[183]  How few would submit to God and His Bible absolutely!
[184]  The Laodicean atmosphere has pervaded the church and individuals.
[185]  What man now asks is not what God's will is or what God's word says, but what the opinion of others is.
[186]  The title "Amen" here means that Christ is the One who accomplishes and affirms every thought and purpose of God.
[187]  There is nothing more advanced or progressive than Christ.
[188]  There is also a similar passage in Colossians: "Who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation" 1:15 .
[189]  Does this mean that the Lord Jesus is also a creature, but first among the other creatures?
[190]  No, because following this it says, "Because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.
[191]  And He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him; and He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things" vv.
[192]  Here we see the Lord Jesus as the beginning of God's creation and its relationship to Him as Head of the church.
[193]  Laodicea gave Him no place, but the Bible shows us that the Lord Jesus should "have the first place in all things."
[194]  If we are still ignorant of this and are still trying to accomplish God's holy demands with our mind, emotion, and will of the old creation, or if we think that we still have any strength to do God's will or have any intention to please God, and if we still do not realize our utter corruption and see that our only place is the place of death where we will fully trust in the Lord, we still do not understand what the Christian life means.
[195]  Verses 15-16: "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.
[196]  As the Lord has spoken to the other churches, in the same way He is now speaking to Laodicea.
[197]  "Because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold."
[198]  "As long as I can go to heaven, I will be satisfied!"
[199]  Moreover, its messenger was also recognized by the Lord.
[200]  This makes it impossible for such a one to be a wolf coming in sheep's clothing.
[201]  If this messenger had been an unsaved one, the Lord could not have acknowledged him.
[202]  Not only was this one not excommunicated by the Lord, but he was not rebuked at all.
[203]  Verse 17: "Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked."
[204]  But the Lord is not pleased with the self-contentment of the rich ones, nor is He pleased with the seeking that comes from discontentment.
[205]  What the Lord wants is for a man to be discontented for his lack of riches before God and his poverty before men.
[206]  At the same time, we see that those Laodiceans whose eyes are strictly set on material things are boasting of their new inventions.
[207]  I do not say that these are the believers.
[208]  Laodicea thinks that its condition is admirable and enviable.
[209]  Yet the Lord told it that it is pitiful.
[210]  They are pitiful because first they do not have Christ, and second they think that what they have is plentiful.
[211]  Verse 18: "I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see."
[212]  Although the condition is so bad, Christ still thinks that there is the possibility of rescue.
[213]  Corporately speaking, to be spewed out is the inevitable outcome, but here the Lord is exhorting individuals and hoping for the individuals to turn to Him.
[214]  We must differentiate between the righteousness of Christ and the righteousness of the saints.
[215]  Christ as our robe of righteousness is a matter of our appearance before God.
[216]  John told the little ones in the house of God, "And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know....And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him" 1 John 2:20, 27 .
[217]  Verse 19: "As many as I love I rebuke and discipline; be zealous therefore and repent."
[218]  It is very interesting that out of seven letters the Lord told only two churches that He loves them one is Philadelphia, the best; the other is Laodicea, the worst.
[219]  Before the heart is taught by the Lord, we are the Laodiceans, but after we fully submit to the Lord, we not only drop all the Laodicean conduct but also hate the Laodicean brothers.
[220]  "Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me" v. 20 .
[221]  This is what the Lord says to the entire church in Laodicea.
[222]  Regardless of whether it is the actual Laodicea of that day or the Laodicea of this age, all should listen to what the Lord says here.
[223]  No matter how much the believers act and work, if they deny the name of the Lord and do not keep His word, Christ will have no room to stand among them.
[224]  However, the Lord's knocking here is only for individuals.
[225]  Although the Lord cannot do what He wants to do, He can always do what He can do.
[226]  Verse 21: "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne."
[227]  Each church has its own special circumstances and its own specific temptations that it should overcome.
[228]  Outwardly, this church seems to have none of these; there seem to be no persecutions, heresies, or filthy sins.
[229]  How I wish that this calling would meet and create open ears, so that they would no longer be bound by their coldness, and that they would zealously follow the Lord forsaken by the world.
[230]  If we have a clearer separation from the old creation, and if we have a clearer understanding of the Lord's resurrection life, we will see that not only will we have a deeper union with the Lord experientially speaking, of course , but we will experience a further oneness with one another.
[231]  Philadelphia, on the other hand, means nothing other than being a prisoner of the Lord, one who has completely forsaken all that is of man, who has obeyed the Lord, and who is living according to the Lord.
