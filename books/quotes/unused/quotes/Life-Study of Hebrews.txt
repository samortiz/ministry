In our Life-study of Hebrews, we shall be concerned with the profound concepts of this book and with its heavenly inheritance
If we are to enter into the concepts and riches of the book of Hebrews, we must understand the background of its writing
Although the book of Hebrews does not itself say to whom it was written, it was written to the Hebrew believers
The saints who collected the divine writings in the early days entitled this book 'the Epistle to the Hebrews'
Since Eber may be spelled Heber in Greek, some Bible students have thought that the Hebrews are descendants of Eber
That great river separated the old region out of which Abraham was called from the new land into which he entered
Abraham was called by God and passed over the great river Euphrates, entering into the land where God eventually built His temple
The flood separated him from the devilish world and ushered him into a new land where he built an altar and offered sacrifices
Then the Lord said unto Moses Go in unto Pharaoh and tell him Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews Let my people go that they may serve me
We must proclaim to the world that our God is 'the God of the Hebrews,' that we are Hebrews, and that we have passed over the water
They crossed the water and entered into the wilderness where they, as a new people, built God's tabernacle in a new way
They were possessed by the enemy and even the temple with all of its services was utilized usurped possessed and ruined by the enemy of God
After they were baptized they could say, 'Once we were on the other side of the river, but now we are on this side'
The second water crossing, that of the Jordan, delivered them from wandering in the wilderness and ushered them into the good land
If, after crossing the Red Sea, you immediately enter into the good land, you do not need to cross the river Jordan
The overcomers will be upon the sea of glass just as the children of Israel were upon the seashore having passed through the Red Sea
When the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, they looked back and saw that Pharaoh and all his forces had been drowned in the sea
We are in God's habitation, God's house, which is both in the heavens and in our spirit, and Christ is the heavenly ladder that joins them
The Hebrews to whom this book was written believed in the Lord, but they still wanted to hold on to their Jewish religion
As long as you are not definitely, absolutely, and all-inclusively for Christ, you are still holding on to something
63 Ananias, one of the high priests in the Jewish religion in Jerusalem, rose up with the Sadducees and Pharisees to persecute the Hebrews
At that time those dear Hebrews appreciated the Lord Jesus, but they were unwilling to forsake their old religion
On the one hand, we may appreciate the church life; on the other hand, we may be unwilling to forsake the old things
Perhaps those Hebrews said to themselves, 'If it is right to follow Christ, God would certainly grant us His blessing
They could not say that what Peter and Paul preached and talked was wrong; neither could they say that the temple, the sanctuary, was wrong
It seems that the writer of the book was saying, 'You are Hebrews, yet you are not willing to cross the separating water
When we get into our spirit, we cross the river out of our wandering minds, pass through the veil, and come into the holiest of all
In the gospels is the Christ who lived on the earth and died on the cross for the accomplishment of redemption
He is the Christ now, the Christ today, and the Christ on the throne who is our daily salvation and moment by moment supply
Your ministry, your preaching, and Christian work might all be shells if they are merely religious activity without Christ
Anything that is fundamental, scriptural, religious and anything that is for God, yet which does not have Christ as its reality is a shell
Sisters, your head covering should have Christ in it, for without Christ, your head covering is merely an empty shell
Worshipping God, serving God, behaving ourselves before God, all are good, but if they are void of Christ they are merely a religion
Hebrews 1:1-3 tells as that Christ has accomplished everything and that He is now sitting on the right hand of the Majesty on high
He is now supplying us with all the heavenly life, authority, and power that we might live a heavenly life on earth
It does not mention who the writer of this book is, nor, in all its quotations from the Old Testament, does it mention the speakers' names
If not every sentence, then at least a great many sentences in the Bible could never have come out of a human mind
If you do not believe that the writer of the gospels is qualified to be Christ, then you try to write such books
So many of us can testify that whenever we come to the Bible, regardless of the chapter, the light shines upon us
Some who have not obeyed such a word from the Lord have testified that even in their dreams they have expressed His word to go and apologize
Before many of the sisters came into the Lord's recovery, they had no conviction whatsoever when they were angry with their husbands
Now that these same sisters are in the Lord's recovery, they find that God speaks to them immediately whenever they lose their temper
If they are angry with their husbands on a Saturday night, they may have no peace to take the Lord's table the next day
Why do the pew members in the Christian denominations sit dumbly in their pews during the Sunday eleven o'clock service?
The Word brings in light, light brings in the sight and the vision, and the vision gives the knowledge, wisdom, and utterance
Even now, if you were to keep yourself from the Word, the messages, and the meetings for two weeks, you would be dead
If the same people were not in the church life, they would have the appearance of scorpions, turtles, or monkeys
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy-each book is a different portion and each book has many portions
The Old Testament has various portions: the histories, the chronicles, the Psalms, the Proverbs, and many different prophets
When God spoke to Moses, He did not do it through a clear word, but through a bush that was burning yet was not burnt
The Son's being the Word is mainly to declare God the Father , that is, to declare, define, express, and reveal God
If you consider the seven comparisons in Revelation 2 and 3, you will see that whatever the Son speaks is the speaking of the Spirit
God speaks in the Son, the Son becomes the speaking Spirit, and the speaking Spirit is one with the church speaking for God
God speaks in the Son, the Son speaks as the Spirit to the churches, and ultimately the Spirit speaks with the church
Some of the members of that group came to see that they did not have the truth, that what they had was falsehood
Hebrews 1:8 reveals that the Son who is the effulgence of God's glory and the express image of God's substance is God Himself
In the past, He was the Creator; in the present, He is the Upholder; and in the future, He will be the Heir to inherit all things
The book of Hebrews stresses the fact that Christ has accomplished everything for God and us, leaving nothing for us to do
The Old Testament was of the law in letters and forms; of man, earthly, temporary; and by sight, issuing in a religion called Judaism
The New Testament is of life, spiritual, heavenly, permanent, and by faith, focused in a person who is the Son of God
They were not involved in idolatry, for the holy temple had been erected for the purpose of worshipping the God of their forefathers
In the Levitical service, the priests offered the sacrifices ordained by God and burned the incense as He had required
They held these two ends with their two hands, holding Christ in the one hand and their forefathers' religion in the other
Although they loved their old religion, the high priest in that religion took the lead to persecute them, making their situation very clear
Let them compare white with black, Christ with religion, the church with the world, heaven with hell, and then let them make their choice
In a full way, he presents what is in God's economy, showing the superiority of Christ as compared with their old religion
In Judaism, the typical and genuine religion formed and established according to the Old Testament, the major item is God
There is no need to consider all of the books of the Pentateuch written by Moses; it is sufficient to present only one, Deuteronomy
Today, if people do not have an attorney, they have no protection, but if they are under the care of a good attorney, they can be at peace
The heathen had no attorney before God to take care of them, but the Jews had priests before God as their attorneys
The fifth and last main item of which Judaism could boast was the old covenant made by God with the Jewish people
No other people on the earth has such a divine covenant that they may be God's people according to God's desires and requirements
The intention of the book of Hebrews is to show the Hebrew believers the superiority of God's economy over Judaism
He firstly points out that in God's economy the first superior thing is not only God, but God expressed, that is, God the Son
The first comparison that this book presents is the comparison between the God in His salvation and the God in the Jewish religion
When the apostle John was in the Jewish religion before he was saved, he could never say, 'We beheld His glory'
In the New Testament, that is, in God's salvation, God speaks in the Son who is God's Word, God's speaking, and even God Himself
The Father is for His being, and the Son is for His being given to reach us, to be gained by us in our experience
Our God is the expressed God the God who reaches us who is received by us who is experienced by us and who becomes our enjoyment day by day
It goes without saying that our Christ, the Son of God, is even more superior to the angels than was the God of Judaism
As creatures, the angels are much inferior to the Son, and as the Creator, the Son is much superior to the angels
Verse 1:4 says, 'Having become, by so much, better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they'
Romans 1:4 says that Christ 'was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead'
Christ, after being seated on the throne in His ascension, is waiting for His enemies to be subdued as His footstool
And, when He brings again the Firstborn into the inhabited earth, He says, And let all the angels of God worship Him'
Verse 8 says, 'But as to the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom'
Verse 10 says, 'You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands'
Many aspects of Christ can only be seen in Hebrews, and other particular aspects of Him can only be found in Revelation
Some deal with the book of Revelation in the way of talking about horns, beasts, horses, scorpions, locusts, and frogs
Believe me, if you are going to know Christ, you must know this message, for it contains a particular aspect concerning Christ
To say that we are heirs of salvation means that we inherit this profound, marvelous, immeasurable, and unlimited Christ
He also has given the Son the authority to do everything in His purpose and the right to inherit all things in His operation
Hebrews 1:2 says that God made the universe through the Son and that He appointed the Son to be the Heir of all things
In order to realize that we are the heirs of salvation, we must be aware that, in God's economy, God has the Firstborn Son and the many sons
John 3:16, a verse familiar to every Christian, says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son
After His resurrection, since many sons of God have been produced, He became God's Firstborn Son with many brothers
In God's salvation we are not only born of God to be His sons , but also made 'heirs of God and joint-heirs of Christ'
In order for a person to become God's heir he needs three things: to be reborn as a child of God, to grow into maturity, and to be legalized
Perhaps when you hear this you might say, 'Since Christ is the Firstborn, we have no right to touch the throne of the kingdom'
The Firstborn Son of God is God's appointed Heir, and we, the many sons, have been saved to be His joint-heirs
Inheriting the earth during the millennium is just a prize similar to the prize awarded to a student who receives straight A's in school
Since Christ as the Firstborn Son of God is God's appointed Heir and we as the many sons of God are His joint-heirs, we are His partners
In the entire universe God has only one corporationChrist and the Churchand this corporation has millions of angels to be the serving ones
The angels ascend and descend as they do their service, which is to take care of the house of God as the gate of heaven
We must remember that in Hebrews we are told that we are joint-heirs of Christ, His partners, and the house of God, today's Bethel on earth
The church today is the house of God composed of God's many sons with Christ, the Firstborn Son of God, as the heavenly ladder
The church is the gate of heaven with Christ as the heavenly ladder joining earth to heaven and bringing heaven to earth
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth for service for the sake of those who are about to inherit salvation'?
When Rhoda, a maidservant, opened the door and told the people in the house that it was Peter, they said that it must have been his angel
We are partners in the heavenly corporation of 'Christ and the Church,' and have millions of angels ministering to us
We are the partners jointowners with Him of the universe while the angels are merely our servants not only inferior to Him but also to us
The Son has been appointed to be the Heir, and we have been saved to be His joint-heirs, sharing in His inheritance
The 'so great a salvation' referred to in 2:3 is able to save us to such an extent that it brings us into the partnership of His appointment
Upon this ladder the angels of God are ascending and descending as ministering spirits for service to us who inherit so great a salvation
The angels are simply our ministering servants, whereas we are the glorious heirs of God's marvelous salvation
Although that river is small, it separates you from the holy of holies, from the enjoyment of 'so great a salvation'
The first, 'outside the camp,' is found in 13:13, which says, 'Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach'
When we came out of Egypt and crossed the Red Sea, no one ever told us that we would have to cross the Jordan'
The old knowledge and experience that those co-workers had became their Chaldea, and they would not cross the river
According to the Bible, we may deal with this matter of the Trinity in two ways-in the way of doctrine or in the way of experience
As far as doctrine is concerned, the Father and the Son are two, but as far as experience goes, when you see the Son, you see the Father
At a certain time, a number of our co-workers and myself felt that we had to taste and see the so-called Pentecostal things
Originally, everything established according to the divine oracles in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy was true
But as to the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom
You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness therefore God Your God has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners
For the unveiling of 'so great a salvation,' Hebrews firstly refers us to Christ as the Son of God, even as God Himself
Before 2:3, where 'so great a salvation' is mentioned, Hebrews reveals how Christ is the Son of God, even God Himself
In heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned; As the man by God exalted, With God's glory he is crowned
Revelation tells us that He is the Son of Man among the local churches and that He will return as the Son of Man
Although He is resurrected Jesus is still a man a resurrected man an uplifted man a man who in ascension is on the throne in the heavens
In this 'so great a salvation' we enjoy the fullness of the Godhead and the uplifted humanity of the man Jesus
In order to be saved from hell, we do not need a captain, but if we are to enter into glory, into the good land of rest, we need the Captain
After Abraham had fought against the enemy and released Lot, Melchisedec, the High Priest, came to him ministering the bread and wine
The 'so great a salvation' not only has a Redeemer and a Savior but also a Captain fighting for us and a High Priest ministering to us
Death has been abolished, Satan, who holds the power of death, has been destroyed, and we have been released from slavery
Now we come to the second part of this comparison-that Jesus as the Son of Man, as man, is superior to the angels
Verses 1 through 4 give us a warning, telling us that there will be a 'just recompense' for neglecting 'so great a salvation'
The Lord's wonderful Person plus His splendid work are 'so great a salvation,' a salvation which none of us should neglect
According to this portion of Hebrews, a saved person, whose salvation is eternally secure, might miss the 'coming inhabited earth'
If you know the Bible as a whole, you will realize that the 'coming inhabited earth' will be this earth in the coming age with God's kingdom
Psalm 2:8 says that God has given to Christ the nations to be His inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for His possession
Revelation 1115 says The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign for ever and ever
The day is coming-perhaps it will be soon-when the nations, the kingdoms, of the earth will become the kingdom of Christ
Suddenly a stone 'cut out without hands' will descend out of heaven and will break in pieces the iron, clay, brass, silver, and gold
As the stone for Gods building He is the foundation stone cornerstone topstone and living stone to produce us as stones for Gods building
According to the Bible, at the time of creation, God determined that man should exercise His authority over the earth
Without such a dominion in which He can exercise His authority, it would be difficult for God to express His glory
Although it is not the kingdom in full scale, it is at least the kingdom in small scale, signifying the same things in the same principle
If we neglect 'so great a salvation' today, we shall not escape this 'just recompense' of missing the sharing of the coming kingdom on earth
God's purpose for man is in three stages: the stage of creation, the stage of prophecy, and the stage of fulfillment
When Jacob was young, he was a supplanter and deceived everyone: his brother, his father, his uncle, and his brothers-in-law
Even Pharaoh, the greatest king on earth at the time, was blessed by Israel when Joseph brought his father to see him
Israel with Joseph expressed God with His image on the one hand and represented God with His authority on the other
Although the situation at the end of the book of Genesis was very pitiful, it is most promising by the time we come to Psalm 8
In the prophecy regarding the recovery of man's lost ordination in Psalm 8 it says that God has made man 'a little lower than the angels'
In the quotation in Hebrews 2 it says that God has set man over the works of His hands and has subjected all things under His feet
It may be called the recovery of what was given to man in Genesis 1 and was lost due to the fall of man in Genesis 3
The man Jesus, in the fulfillment of the prophecy in Psalm 8, was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death
On the one hand, He already was the Lord because He was God; on the other hand, in His humanity, He was crowned to be the Lord of all
The anointed One is the appointed One, and the appointed One is the One who runs God's universal corporation, Christ and the church
The Greek word for Leader translated Prince in the King James Version is the same Greek word that is rendered as Captain in Hebrews 210
In this message we come to the matter of Jesus in incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and exaltation
In no portion as short as Hebrews 2 do we see incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and exaltation put together
No other chapter affords us such a revelation of Christ as the Son of God from eternity past to eternity future
As a result of that higher preaching of the gospel, many doctors, nurses, professors, and learned people were brought to the Lord
If you would go to China and preach the gospel to the learned people and mention Christmas, they would not listen to you
They would say that things such as Christmas trees, stockings full of candies, and Santa Claus are too low, shallow, and childish
That is the paganism the leaven mentioned by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 1333 brought into Catholicism by the woman as the Lord prophesied
We must tell them of God's purpose-that God came as man in order to establish His corporation of Christ and the church
When we preached about God's purpose regarding Christ and the church, some of the professors and students said, 'We must get into this
The Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God's righteous demands on us
Although there are death and sin in the universe because of Christs death His allinclusive crucifixion we are through with death and sin
The Greek word translated destroy may also be rendered as 'bring to nought, make of none effect, do away with, abolish, annul, discard'
After the devil, the serpent, seduced man into the fall, God promised that the seed of woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent
Because of the allinclusive crucifixion of Christ there is no more death no more sin no more devil no more fear of death and no more slavery
Through experience we do realize that death sin the devil the fear of death and slavery were all truly crossed out in Christs crucifixion
He was the one grain of wheat falling into the ground, dying, and growing up to bring forth many grains, which are we
He was the one grain and we are now the many grains, His many brothers, brought forth by Him in His resurrection
In His resurrection Christ not only brought forth many brothers, but He came to His brothers and declared to them the Father's name
In his second Epistle Peter said that we are partakers of the divine nature having received all things that pertain unto life and godliness
How is it that we have received the divine nature and that all things pertaining to life have been given to us?
In resurrection, Christ not only declared the Father's name to His brothers, but also praised the Father in the church
Individually speaking, they are His brothers and collectively speaking, they are the church brought forth in His resurrection
On the day of Pentecost the church was enlarged, but the first church meeting was in the evening of the day of the Lord's resurrection
In the church meeting the Lord not only declared the Father's name to His brothers, but also praised the Father in the midst of the church
After resurrection, Christ was glorified, not only in the manifestation of His divine nature but also in the ascension into God's glory
Glory is His divine splendor, and honor is the worth of His preciousness in His virtues and His dignity in His position
We saw Him on the cross on earth with the crown of thorns, but now we see Him on the throne in heaven crowned with glory and honor
From the earthly viewpoint, it was an ascension from man, but from the heavenly viewpoint, it was an exaltation by God
After Christ had been crowned with glory and honor in His ascension, God gave Him the dominion over all things in His exaltation
Adam lost the dominion that God gave to him, but, according to the prophecy of Psalm 8, Christ has recovered what Adam lost
The second man has been glorified, crowned with glory and honor, and entrusted with the divine dominion that was lost by the first man
It seems that, logically speaking, for salvation we need Jesus to be our Savior and Redeemer, not our Captain, Pioneer, or Forerunner
Some say this glory is a luxurious state into which we shall enter in the future and which will thrill and excite us very much
The New Testament tells us that we have been called into glory and that this glory was designed according to God's wisdom in eternity past
Although the plant needs the soil and the soil helps it to grow, it is, nevertheless, a frustration to the growth of the carnation
That blossoming stage was also a fighting stage, for they began to fight almost immediately after entering into the good land
Apparently, the glory that filled the temple came down from above; actually, the glory was with the children of Israel
His whole life, from the time He was born until the day He was resurrected from the dead, was a fighting process
It is God who maintains all things in the universe that they may serve the purpose of accomplishing His glory business
He is qualified to bring the many sons of God into the region of glory which He has already entered as the Pioneer
The writer seemed to be telling the Hebrew believers, 'Hebrew brothers and sisters, you must realize that our Jesus is the real Joshua
He has cut the way into glory, He has taken the lead to enter into glory, and He is now the Captain bringing His followers into glory
He is not leading us into some objective glory, but into that very glory which has been sown into our inner being
During the day God was seen as the cloud and during the night He was seen as the pillar of fire-that was glory
In the Gospel of John we read that the Word was God, that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and that we all beheld His glory
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
In the New Jerusalem, God is in the Lamb, and the Lamb is the lamp with God shining in and through Him as the light
Eventually, this light will shine through the wall of the city, a wall that is made of jasper, is crystal clear, and expresses God's image
Since many of the new ones might not be familiar with this matter, let us examine the verses in Revelation more carefully
The glory into which we shall enter is not an objective shining or brightness; it is God Himself shining from, through, and out of us
When we look at the New Jerusalem, we see the expression of God's appearance, the light in the lamp shining through the jasper
When the Bible says that Christ is the Lamb, it does not mean, of course, that He is literally a lamb with four feet and a tail
When God Himself comes into us, He is life; when He works in us, He is light; and when He is expressed in us, He is glory
God came in and called Abraham out of that ruined mankind, that is, out of Chaldea, making him the head and father of the called race
We must look at the Bible and the people in it as a whole, and not just consider a few individuals, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses
If you know the kernel of the Bible, you will realize that everywhere there is a river for God's people to cross
The Lord as the Pioneer and Forerunner is the example, the model, of a person who has crossed the river and entered into God's glory
By His growing up, His whole being, including His humanity and His human nature, was brought into the glorious expression of God
The Lord suffered death, crossing the river of death, and entered into the glory, into the full expression of the Divine Being
What was typified by Abraham and by his descendants at the time of the building of the temple, was fulfilled in the Lord Jesus
He is the example, the model, because He was the first One who pioneered into glory, the One who paved the way
On the one hand, this wonderful One is within the veil, dwelling there in the expression of God and as the expression of God
We may use the example of electricity to illustrate how Christ can be there within the veil and here within us at the same time
He entered within the veil as the Pioneer the Forerunner entering into the glory which is the full glorious expression of the Divine Being
All our sufferings are just the lightness, the present lightness of the affliction that works for us the eternal weight of glory
When our whole being has been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, that glory will come out of us
Even now He is ministering to us from God's glory, ministering Himself into us as the bread and wine to sustain and support us
After the recovery of justification by faith, the recovery of sanctification followed, but it followed in a way that was not fully accurate
It was on the boat on the way to the United States that he received help regarding this from the Moravian brothers
In one of his writings he says that if he had not had the burden for England, he would have remained in Bohemia for the rest of his life
In the early part of the nineteenth century, the Brethren under the leadership of John Nelson Darby were raised up
Using Matthew 23:20, the Brethren teachers showed that, according to the words of the Lord Jesus, the altar sanctifies the sacrifice
The Brethren, famous for their doctrinal debates, also appealed to 1 Timothy 4:4-5, which says that food is sanctified by the saints' prayer
When that same food is placed on the saints' dining table and is prayed over by the saints, it is sanctified by the saints' prayer
When we studied the various schools of sanctification many years ago, we agreed with the teaching of the Brethren
In this sanctification, Christ, as the life-giving Spirit, is saturating all the inward parts of our being with God's divine nature
Now we come to Hebrews 2:11 which says, 'For both He Who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one'
By this one verse, we can see that sanctification here is neither sinless perfection nor merely a positional change
The holiness, the sanctification, mentioned in the Bible includes dispositional transformation along with positional change
He had the divine nature-that was the Son of God-but He also had on the human nature, and that was not the Son of God
We are like the Firstborn Son of God because we are sons of God with a divine nature as well as a human nature
Now we can understand why the only begotten Son of God could not sanctify us and why the Firstborn Son of God can sanctify us
The Firstborn can sanctify us because He, like us, has two natures and because we have the same natures as He does
Although we were a people who had problems with God, now, through His propitiation, we have no problems with Him
The people on the street are not qualified, but we are fully qualified through the propitiation and resurrection of Christ
Although we were born of God at the time of our regeneration, we still have not been thoroughly separated unto God
In the book of Hebrews all of the basic factors of the New Testament are implied in a deeper and yet very simple way
Although you might have read Hebrews a number of times, perhaps you have never been impressed with the mention of the church in this book
The Son says to the Father that He will declare the Father's name to His brothers and sing hymns of praise to the Father in the church
God is our divine Father, and we all are His divine sons because we all have been born of His divine life with His divine nature
Approximately one hundred fifty years ago it was revealed to some of the brothers that the church is not a building of brick and stone
Later on, we began to see that the church is not only a gathering of real believers; it is a body, the Body of Christ
Praise Him that He has granted us to see that the church has two natures-the human nature and the divine nature
Do you realize that the Firstborn Son of God has two lives and two natures, that He is not only the Son of God, but also the Son of Man?
Although you may think that a certain church is not good, after a period of time that church becomes very different
The church is neither physical nor organizational; it is altogether of life-the divine life and the uplifted, resurrected human life
The human life that we have today for the church is not the natural human life but the uplifted, resurrected human life
The church is a living composition of all the sons of God, a living corporation of all the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God
We have not become sons of God because of an accident; we were predestinated to be the sons of God before the foundation of the world
According to your feeling, that was all an accident, but according to God, it was because you had already been marked out
We, God's chosen ones, are surrounded by angels who know how to arrange our surroundings that we might be brought into sonship
At the time when we received the Lord Jesus by believing in Him we were born of God and received the right to be the children of God
It includes both, for the spirit that we have received is a mingled spirit, a spirit that is both divine and human
Romans 815 says that we the sons of God cry Abba Father but a sister verse Galatians 46 says that the Spirit cries Abba Father
He was born to be the Firstborn Son of God through His resurrection , and we have been produced to be His many brothers in His resurrection
On the day of resurrection the Lord came to them to declare the Father to make them know the Father as the source of life
The Bible only mentions this very briefly, but this brief mention is like a little show window through which we can see a great deal
According to that prophecy, after His resurrection Christ came mainly to His disciples to make the Father known to them
If we had been there when the Lord did this, we would have realized that that declaration was not just a matter of mentioning the name
Now in all the church meetings He is waiting for the opportunity to cooperate with us in singing praises to the Father
The more we praise the Father in the church meetings, the more He praises the Father in our praising, and the more we enjoy Him and gain Him
It is a corporate partnership with Christ, the Firstborn Son of God, to participate in the Father's life, nature, and being
In this message, on a merciful and faithful High Priest, we come to the conclusion of the first two chapters of Hebrews
Although, as the many sons of God and as the many brothers of the Firstborn, we are divine as well as human, we are not almighty
Our High Priest, Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the Son of Man, is both merciful and faithful because He is both God and man
We may even say that He is more than like us, for He suffered in His human life some things we have not suffered
In order to be qualified to be a merciful High Priest, He became like us, sympathizing with all of our weaknesses
Sometimes the Lord Jesus spoke a word and the religionists picked on it and twisted it, trying to make a case out of it against the Lord
If you were to go to the Lord Jesus and ask Him whether or not religious people can lie, He would say, 'They certainly can
No human being has ever been tempted, tested, attacked, opposed, and misunderstood by the religionists as He was
In suffering death, He crossed the river and entered into the region that is full of God's expression, full of God's glory
We have been released by Him from the slavery of sin, from the slavery of the fear of death, and even from the slavery of death itself
He is the Firstborn Son of God in resurrection, and we are His many brothers in resurrection to form the church
In the past, many of us have had the experience of being ministered unto by Christ as our High Priest without knowing much about it
If, as priests, we only know how to render service to God without knowing how to minister God to man, we shall be quite poor
As we have pointed out on other occasions, the first mention of a thing in the Bible establishes the principle for that category of things
The main point with respect to Christ as the High Priest is not that He serves God but that He ministers God to us
Everyone including the unbelievers on the street knows that a Catholic priest is one who serves God burns incense and fulfills his holy duty
The brothers and sisters in every service group must constantly minister the riches of God in Christ to people
The main task of this service group is not simply to clean the hall, arrange the chairs, and keep everything in order
The real priesthood comes into being when you minister God to people as you clean the hall and arrange the chairs
If you read Hebrews 1 and 2, you will see that this wonderful, mysterious, marvelous One is now our High Priest
The King James Version says, 'For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham'
The Recovery Version says, 'For assuredly He does not take hold of angels, but He takes hold of the seed of Abraham'
The King James Version says the Lord Jesus did not take upon Him the nature of angels but the nature of the children of Abraham
The full meaning of this word is 'to help, to rescue, by coming to a person, putting him on you, and carrying him'
When we enjoy this succor, we participate in God's element and are brought into the expression of the glorious God
In chapter two we see that the brothers brought forth in the Lord's resurrection are in the process of being sanctified
That verse, which is addressed to Christ, says, 'Your God has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners'
In God's economy, Christ is the One whom God has appointed to accomplish His plan, and we are Christ's partners in the divine interest
Consider our position; we are the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God and we are the partners of God's anointed One
If you were a brother of the president of the United States, you would be very proud and have a certain amount of majesty
You are a brother of the Firstborn Son of God and a partner of God's anointed One for the fulfilling of God's plan
The Bible never says that you should not smoke, and the New Testament is not a book of laws but a book of holy brothers
As we preach the gospel, we should not only tell people that they are sinners, that they are condemned, and that they are going to perish
We need to preach the gospel from Hebrews 3:1, telling the sinners how they can be converted and transformed into holy brothers
In His resurrection, Christ has made all of us His brothers and He has come into us to declare the Father to us
Many thoughtful people in the leading universities throughout the country are wondering about the meaning of human life
Christ is the Firstborn Son of God with both divinity and humanity as we have seen in one of the previous messages
The holy brothers, as human beings being regenerated with the divine life, are the brothers of Christ with humanity and divinity
The way to teaify the water is to add the element of tea to the water until the water is saturated and permeated
Christ has put Himself into us, the glass of plain water, to permeate and saturate us until we are fully sanctified with His holy nature
On the one hand, we have been sanctified by the blood of Christ ; on the other hand we have been regenerated with the holy nature of God
As we are on the way to glory Christ is sanctifying us ministering to our needs as the High Priest and bringing us into glory as our Captain
The term heavenly calling is used by the writer of this Epistle to compare this calling with the earthly calling
In God's economy, in His full salvation, we have been called by God from the heavens and called to everything that is heavenly
Do you like to stay with the earthly calling, or will you cross the river to be a true Hebrew partaking of the heavenly calling?
The earthly Jerusalem symbolizes the law with its bondage , whereas the heavenly Jerusalem symbolizes grace with its freedom
In His gospel, God has called us from the heavens to the heavenly things that we may partake of His Holy Spirit
As partakers of the heavenly calling, we need to partake of the divine discipline accomplished by the Holy Spirit through our environment
In this message we come to the third comparison found in the book of Hebrews-that Christ as the Apostle is superior to Moses
We see these two titles of Christ in 3:1 where we are told to 'consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus'
As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we might partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness
As the High Priest, Christ went to God with us to present us to God that we and all our case might be fully cared for by Him
Regardless of how much Moses prefigured Christ, he was still only a part of the house, whereas Christ is the Builder of God's house
Moses was a testimony, a prefigure, a photograph, a type of the real, typical, and genuine Apostle sent from God
He is the foundation stone , the cornerstone , the topstone , and the living stone to produce us as living stones
Moses was an apostle sent from God to constitute God's house on earth, and Christ was also the Apostle doing the same thing
In that chapter Christ is the Captain, the Firstborn Son, and the High Priest in order for the many brothers to be the church
Where the house of God is, there is the family of God, and where the family of God is, there is God the Father with His life and reality
Christ is not separate from all the members of the Body, for, as the Head of the Body, Christ indwells all the members
If we are going to enjoy the Apostle and if we are going to enjoy the Father with His reality, we must be in the house
You may enjoy Him in other aspects, for He is great, kind, and more than merciful, and He will do many things for you
As far as the church as the house of the Father is concerned, you will not be able to enjoy Him as the Apostle
Many times they attended the church meeting in their white uniforms, coming to the meeting as soon as they got off duty
For a month's time the leader turned all of the meetings over to me, not only the meetings of the conference but even the regular meetings
We did not fight with each other, but within we realized that there was a great discrepancy between our understandings of the Lord's economy
If any man can touch this testimony without anything happening to him, it proves that this testimony is nothing
Although we were friends with this dear brother, even intimate friends, we held different concepts regarding the Lord's economy
In the church we have the many brothers of the Firstborn Son of God and the partners, the joint-heirs of the appointed Heir
There in the New Jerusalem will be the Father, the Son as the Lamb, and the Spirit flowing as a river of water
In the church we not only have justification by faith, personal salvation, and forgiveness of sins-we have everything
My burden in this message is to tell you that we are not only partakers enjoying Christ but also partners following Him
Our view must be broadened to see that God's operation in the whole universe is to accomplish a glorious expression of Himself
God the Spirit poured Himself out as the anointing oil upon this appointed Heir, anointing Him to be the operator of God's divine operation
We are not only the partakers of Christ who enjoy Him but also the partners of Christ who share in His operation
He is going to accomplish a full expression of God in glory, and we are now cooperating with Him in this operation
From now on, in the churches we need to hear more testimonies concerning being partners of Christ and sharing in His operation
There are two lines in Isaiah 9:6: the child born to us is the Mighty God, and the Son given to us is the everlasting Father
They taught us not to pray to the Son but to the Father in the name of the Son by the power of the Holy Spirit
Not long afterward, Brother Nee spoke to a small group of us on John 14, pointing out that today the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit
When Philip asked the Lord to show them the Father, the Lord said, 'He who has seen Me has seen the Father,' for He and the Father are one
One of the hymns in our hymnal, number 490, was written by Brother Nee and translated by us for inclusion in our hymnal
Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called, But now the Holy Spirit art; The Spirit is Thine other form, Thyself to dwell within our heart
The original Chinese, which is much clearer than the English, says 'Once You were the Father; now You are the Spirit'
The anointed Heir of God, as the Captain of salvation, has entered into rest and glory through death and resurrection
God wanted this unique Heir to enter into the good land of the glorious expression of the Divine Being with a group of joint-heirs
Suppose Joshua, a single person, marched into the good land, saying, 'I have come here by the Almighty God to take over the land'
God could have performed the same miracle with just Joshua, but if He had done this, there would have been no glory
After we have enjoyed Him in such a way, He becomes the Captain who takes the lead, and we follow Him as His partners
We need to spend much time to consider this matter of taking the good land, for it is not as clear as it should be
The lowest view of the good land is that when a saint dies he crosses the river Jordan and enters the good land
Since there are no enemies in the third heaven, the inner life people rejected the low concept of the good land being heaven
Some of them say that Canaan signifies the air, the heavenlies, where the principalities, powers, and evil spirits are
We have been inaugurated with Christ to share His office that, with Him, we might take the land, possess it, and build the house of God
As we saw in that study, all of the life, including the vegetable, animal, and human life, came out of the land
Man's body was made with the dust of the resurrected land, but man himself was made in the image of God for the purpose of expressing God
The land, Christ, and humanity combined together are the expression of God and the kingdom of God where God's glory and authority are
Revelation 211 says I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea
We see that the old heaven and the old earth will pass away and that there will be a new heaven and a new earth
If you look at Revelation 21 you will see a picture of the land Christ and all of Gods chosen regenerated sanctified and glorified people
From the whole revelation of God's divine Word, we can see that in eternity past God planned to express Himself
God came in and raised up the land that had been covered by the death water, raising it out of the death water on the third day
The land that was raised out of the water on the third day was a type of the resurrected Christ from whom all life has come into being
Genesis 1:26 says that man was made in the image of God, and Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God
When God judged the flesh, He also judged the earth, for the flesh, that is, mankind, cannot be separated from the earth
Ararat on exactly the same day of the month as the Lord Jesus was resurrected from the dead-the seventeenth day
The Lord was crucified on the fourteenth day of the month, the day of the Passover, and three days later He was resurrected
In other words, the Lord Jesus was resurrected on the same day and in the same month as the ark was resurrected from the death water
The resurrected people lived on the new earth, and, once again, that new earth typified the resurrected Christ
If you read the history of Israel according to the record of the Bible, you will see that God always put Israel and the land together as one
God came in and called Abraham out of that corrupted Chaldea, meaning that He called him out of the corrupted mankind
According to geography, the land of Canaan is surrounded by water, by the Mediterranean Sea, the Dead Sea, and the Jordan River
When his descendants fell away from that good land, God brought them out of their fallen place and restored them to the good land
On the one hand, the temple was God's expression, and, on the other hand, it was God's kingdom, government, and administration
In the Old Testament we see a miniature of the good land: an elevated land surrounded by death water and filled with God's dwelling place
He will not just have a tract of land but a whole new earth, an earth resurrected and elevated above all death
All sea, death, and night will be gone forever, and there will be a clean, clear, dry land with a pure river flowing through it
When you were in that old region, in your Chaldea, did you have the sensation that you were in the New Jerusalem?
In the New Jerusalem our taste will mainly be that of the living water for us to drink and that of the tree of life for us to feed upon
Did you have the taste of the New Jerusalem when you were in Catholicism burning candles and making confession to the priests?
To say that the Sabbath rest in 4:9 is simply the millennial kingdom is not altogether accurate; it is only partially correct
In order to have the proper understanding of the Sabbath rest, we need to consider the first mention of it in the Bible
According to the record of Genesis 1, God created all things by means of His word, calling things not being as being through His word
There was a conference among the Godhead and then He used a certain material, the dust of the ground, to create man
At the end of the sixth day, after man had been created, God saw everything that He had made and said, 'Very good'
In enlivening the impotent man, the Lord did something which, according to the Jewish regulations, was not permitted on the Sabbath day
Verse 16 says, 'And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He did these things on the Sabbath'
Don't you know that the Sabbath has been lost, that the Sabbath on which God was satisfied has been lost, destroyed by the enemy of God?
Christ with the kingdom will be the rest in a fuller way to the overcoming saints who will be co-kings with Him and share and enjoy His rest
All His overcoming followers, who seek and enjoy Him as their rest in the first stage, will participate in His reign at that time
In actuality, however, this rest was not realized by the children of Israel when they entered into the good land
Now we can understand why the book of Hebrews warns the believers not to miss the Sabbath, telling them to be diligent to enter into it
If you read chapters three and four of Hebrews carefully, you will find this promise of the remaining Sabbath rest
We must enter into the church life so that God may be expressed and represented on earth today, be satisfied, and find rest
If you just take the Lord as your rest according to your natural, selfish concept, the Lord will eventually turn His face away from you
Many Christians experienced this kind of comfort at the beginning of their Christian life only to find that it did not work well later on
Because in the church God is expressed and represented, and where God is expressed and represented, there is the Sabbath
Today's church is the good land because in the church God has His habitation for His expression and representation
Based upon this understanding of the Sabbath rest, we can see in the Bible different ages or periods in the Sabbath rest
Although there are many negative stories concerning the children of Israel in the Bible, they did, nonetheless, express and represent God
If God could only create the earth but not gain it and build His temple, His habitation, on it, then what was the use of the earth?
God had Adam and then, gradually, He had Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham with his descendants, and then the children of Israel
If the Lord Jesus in the flesh was God's Sabbath, then the church, the Body of Christ, must be an even greater Sabbath to God
According to Genesis 1 and 2, in order for God to have His Sabbath rest, He must have His expression and representation
Immediately after the creation of the first man, the old man, God had a Sabbath because God had secured a man to express and represent Him
If God enjoyed a Sabbath rest after the creation of the old man, He must have a greater rest after the creation of the new man
In Deuteronomy 12:9 we are told clearly that the land of Canaan was a rest to Israel because it was a rest to God
According to this concept, after the Lord Jesus presented the kingdom to the Jewish people and they rejected it, the kingdom was suspended
While Matthew 6:10 says that we should pray, 'Thy kingdom come,' Matthew 16:18-19 indicates that the kingdom comes when the church is built
Although the whole book of Matthew is on the kingdom, it speaks of the church in both chapters sixteen and eighteen
In Romans, a book that is on the church life, not on the kingdom, we see that the kingdom of God is the church life
Ephesians 2:15 speaks of the new man, Ephesians 2:22 speaks of the habitation of God in our spirit, and Ephesians 3:21 speaks of the church
Verses 8 and 9 continue saying For if Joshua had brought them into rest He would not have spoken concerning another day after these things
The writer seemed to be saying to the Hebrew believers, 'Your fathers in the wilderness did not listen to the word of God
If we did not have this word here we would be unable to see that the Sabbath rest today is the house of God under the care of the Son of God
Although thousands of Christians have been saved, so many of them remain in the wilderness; they have never entered into the good land
The house of God under the care of the Son of God is our rest, home, homeland, land of Emmanuel, and good land flowing with milk and honey
Not only is He walking among the churches, but, as Revelation 2 and 3 reveal, He is the Spirit speaking to the churches
If you apply this concept to all of the verses in Isaiah concerning the Sabbath, you will see how meaningful it is
The church is the place where the Firstborn Son of God can declare the Father to His brothers and sing praises to the Father
Every time we meet together we have the sense that the Lord is happy with us, that the Son of God is praising the Father
Barnabas brought the Apostle Paul into his ministry and for quite a while was an apostle working along with Paul
If you would check with those who are opposing the church life or dissenting with it today, you will find that none of them has rest
God could never find His full rest in heaven, because heaven is not the place where His eternal purpose is fulfilled
Regardless of how wonderful or excellent the angels may be, God's rest is not with the angels in heaven but with man on the earth
Eventually the Bible reveals that Gods full rest His full Sabbath will be on the earth with a living composition of all the redeemed people
In the Old Testament we have two outstanding stories concerning God's Sabbath: the first in Genesis 2 and the second in 1 Kings 8
If we had been there, we probably would not have been very patient, saying to God, 'God, the light is here, but we need air'
One day, God became a man, sowed Himself into mankind, and after the death and resurrection of that man, the church was produced
Although the seed was sown nearly two thousand years ago, God did not accomplish all the work once for all at that time
God never sowed Himself into the soil of Adam or into the soil of the children of Israel because they were types
A dog may grow to maturity in less than a year, but a human being needs at least eighteen years to grow into maturity
God has sown Himself into a part of mankind which became the church and which includes everyone who has received the Lord Jesus
We all can be in the growing Sabbath, but whether or not we are in the harvest Sabbath depends completely on our maturity
If they are not diligent, they will miss the mark, as did the majority of the children of Israel who came out of Egypt
Practically speaking, the Sabbath in the next age will be a prize for our proper growth during this present Sabbath
In other words, if you do not grow well in this growing Sabbath, you will miss the next Sabbath, the Sabbath of maturity
The matter of being a castaway mentioned in verse 27 does not refer to being a castaway from salvation but from the prize
In the picture depicted here by Paul, we see that he was running a race, fearing that he himself might be a castaway and miss the prize
Our wise Father uses the coming Sabbath in the millennium as an encouragement for us to run the race properly today
Paul was saying that Christ had gained him for something but that he had not yet gained that for which Christ had gained him
Even at the time when Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he was still on the way, not having gained Christ in full
Will we be able to say that we have fought a good fight finished our race kept the faith and that a crown of righteousness is laid up for us
Paul knew that the Lord, the righteous Judge, would give him a crown of righteousness according to His righteousness in that day
Many Christians hold the mistaken concept that as long as they are saved they will share in the kingdom in the thousand years
While you are sitting in that dark room, your brothers and sisters who passed their finals will enjoy a special prize and a full day's rest'
Although he was so faithful and was doing a marvelous and excellent work for the Lord, he still feared that he might have been a castaway
On the one hand, we all need to be excited that in the church life today we are in the growing Sabbath enjoying the riches of Christ
In the last three messages we have seen the meaning of the Sabbath rest according to the full revelation of the Holy Word
Regardless how long this stage may be according to our feeling, it is still one stage, the stage of sowing and growing
In this stage Gods major task is to sow Himself into mankind and to make this part of mankind the church the Body of Christ the house of God
In the New Testament we are clearly told that the church as the expression and representation of God is the kingdom of God on earth today
We cannot say that we have not received an amount of the kingdom, but our receiving of the kingdom has not yet been fully accomplished
Gods economy is not only that you be saved and regenerated His economy is that you come into the proper church life which is todays Sabbath
We are now in the church life, the growing Sabbath that is leading us into the harvest Sabbath of the millennial kingdom
There will be a new earth, and upon that new earth there will be a city built up with transformed people as the living materials
The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate and eternal Sabbath because there God will be fully expressed and represented
If we do not cooperate with Him, He is patient and will wait for tomorrow, next month, next year, or even for the next age
If we are naughty and do not participate in the growing Sabbath today, we may miss the harvest Sabbath in the coming age
If we do not behave ourselves in His grace today, making it difficult for our Father to deal with us, we may miss the coming harvest Sabbath
There will be a total of three real Sabbaths: the church, the millennial kingdom, and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth
Although all these are Sabbaths to God, the second will be better than the first, and third will be fuller than the second
As long as you are a child of the Father, He has a way to make you mature so that eventually you will participate in that third Sabbath
If we do not cooperate with Him, we shall suffer the loss of the enjoyment of the church life in this age and the prize in the coming age
If we do not enjoy the church well today, we shall suffer the loss of the kingdom as a prize in the coming age
Some say that as long as we have been regenerated and are children of God, we shall be in the millennial kingdom
If we do not satisfy Him today in His house, we shall miss the prize and suffer loss during the next age in His kingdom
At this point we need to consider the two major schools of doctrine-the Calvinist school and the Arminian school
Since we have been chosen forever, once we have been saved, regenerated, and have received eternal life, we can never perish
The growing Sabbath of the church life today is the means by which we may be ushered into the harvest Sabbath in the coming kingdom
The believers can never be lost, but all that they bring forth which is not according to God's economy will be burned
The following verse says, 'If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire'
At this point another elderly brother injected, 'Even if it is 'as by fire,' it can still cause you to suffer'
Since we have this word in 1 Corinthians 3, we should not say that as long as we are saved everything is all right
The Catholic teaching of purgatory, which uses 1 Corinthians 3 as the basis, is much different from the pure Word of God
We need to build according to the Father's nature, the Son's redemption, and the Holy Spirit's transforming work
There is a great difference between building with gold, silver, and precious stones and building with wood, hay, and stubble
How we need to press on toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus and go on positively
In addition to salvation, there will be the prize of this high calling, which will be the harvest Sabbath in the coming kingdom
In this one entity, man, we see a wonderful principle-one creature bearing the earthly substance and the divine image
When we go to the end of the Bible, we see the consummation: the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem
In the new heaven and new earth, the earth will be more useful than heaven because the New Jerusalem will be on the earth
Following this second period, there will be the third period of the universe-the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem
Strictly speaking, only verse 1 of Genesis refers to God's creation, for verse 2 is the beginning of God's re-creation
From the time of God's re-creation until the full completion of His purpose will be a period of approximately seven thousand years
Since it is during this span of time that God accomplishes His eternal purpose, we may call this the period of accomplishment
God's re-creation only recovered the fallen universe back to a condition suitable for man's creation and existence
In his natural make-up, man is not the genuine fulfillment of God's purpose, but only a photograph, a prefigure
In His first coming, He sowed Himself into mankind, and in His second coming He will reap what He sowed in His first coming
Regardless of how wonderful the millennium will be, during that time the old heaven and old earth will still remain in existence
Heaven and earth will be restored during the millennium, but they will not yet be changed from the old to the new
At the end of the millennium, he will be loosed from his prison, will deceive the nations, and will lead them in battle against the Lord
Death, the last enemy , will not be cast into the lake of fire at the second coming of Christ, but at the end of the millennium
Three evil things, Satan, the rebellious nature of man, and death, will still exist even at the end of the millennium
The Lord still requires some time to work in order to eliminate these three evil things from God's eternal universe
Following that, the entire old universe will be over, and the new universe with the New Jerusalem will be ushered in
Only when we are in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem will we be able to shout, 'Hallelujah, everything is now all right'!
Satan, the rebellious human nature, death, the sea, and the unsaved dead people will all need to be dealt with
The church will bring in the kingdom, and the kingdom will usher in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem
Corinthians 11:32 says, 'When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world'
All fundamental Christians agree that if we do not behave ourselves after being saved, the Lord will chastise us
The Lord will ask us to tell Him what we have done that we may receive the reward we deserve, either good or bad
The 'I' who gives us rest in Matthew 11 goes to the church in Matthew 16 and remains in the church in Matthew 18
For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works'
We would turn their argument against them and ask, 'Would not this chastisement also prove that the Lord's redemption is not perfect'?
Where is the verse telling us that the Lord will chastise His people only in this age and not in the coming age?
If you lived in sin after being saved and the Lord offered you a crown at the judgment seat, would you receive it?
If the wheat growing in the field does not ripen, it will never be taken to the barn; it will be left in the field
Matthew 24 reveals that, in a sense, the Lord will come in a secret way, for we are told that He will come as a thief
When we think the thief will come, he does not come, but when we are at peace, thinking that no thief will come, he comes
Do not believe the teaching that there is only one rapture and that all the saints will be raptured at the same time before the tribulation
There are two aspects of the Lord's coming: the secret presence, which is first, and the public appearing, which follows later
We see two categories of living saints: those who are living and have already been taken, and those who are alive and remain
The two saints mentioned in Matthew 24 are the living ones, for they are working in the field and grinding at the mill
At the time of the Lord's coming back, the majority of the church people will have died; only a small number will still be living
The lamps of both the wise and the foolish were shining, but the problem was that the foolish virgins did not have enough oil
When the bridegroom came and the virgins arose , the foolish virgins discovered that they did not have an extra portion of oil
The lamp of the Lord is our spirit , and the extra portion of oil is the transforming Spirit in our soul, in our being
They had to pay the price to gain the extra portion of the Spirit in their soul that they might be transformed
If you do not pay the price to gain the transforming Spirit in your soul today, you will pay it when the Lord comes back
The Spirit who comes into our spirit, lighting the lamp of our spirit, is free, and every regenerated person has it
Although our spirit the lamp of the Lord is enlightened by the Spirit our soul which is our vessel needs to be transformed by the Spirit
According to their concept the Lords dealing with His believers is only in this age leaving nothing for Him to deal with in the coming age
As we have seen, the millennium will be the last part of the period of time in which God accomplishes His eternal purpose
Of course, this present age of the church is very crucial for the Lord to work on His believers for their maturity and perfection
Although we have been saved and have become God's household, God's family, this does not mean that we shall never again be judged by God
If God were unjust in dealing with His own children, how could He judge the unbelievers and those who oppose Him?
The principle here is that in order for God to be just in judging the unbelievers, He must firstly make a righteous judgment of His children
Gods intention is not to gain a group of pure righteous people it is to gain a people who have been saturated with Him and built up in Him
The object of dealing with sin is not merely to deal with the sin itself, but to eliminate the satanic frustration to the growth in life
Having our sins forgiven is a minor thing; being delivered from the sinful frustration so that we may grow in God's life is the major thing
If you have committed a sin but repent and desire to go on with the Lord, God will surely forgive your sin because of Christ's redemption
As long as we desire to grow in life, God will spontaneously take care of our sins and cleanse us with the blood of Jesus
As we pointed out in the last message, in Matthew 24:40-41 we see the two living ones, and in Matthew 25:1-4 we see the ten dead ones
The parable of the ten virgins depicts the life we should have, and the parable of the talents portrays the work we should have
Unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability'
To save yourself means that you do this yourself; to be saved means that someone else does it for you, yet you must allow him to do it
Although salvation is absolutely a matter of grace, we must be willing to be saved and willing to believe in the Lord
The profit comes from the grace of God, but the coming of this grace depends upon our use of our talent, upon our function and exercise
If we grow in life and like the wise virgins have the extra portion of oil in our vessel and have been transformed we shall mature earlier
If we do not mature and exercise our gifts, we shall miss the early rapture and the enjoyment of reigning with Christ
Both the church age and the kingdom age are parts of the period of God's accomplishment for the fulfillment of His purpose
His discipline over us, may not necessarily be in the church age, but may also wisely be in the coming kingdom age
After the foolish virgins discovered that they were lacking in oil, they were told to pay the price and buy it for themselves
It is not, as the Calvinists say, that the five wise virgins were saved and that the five foolish ones were false Christians
The wise virgins and the faithful servants shall enter into a Sabbath rest that is better than the Sabbath rest which we know today
Although we are enjoying a good Sabbath in the church age, it is not as good as the Sabbath to come in the kingdom age
The New Testament also tells us that the saved ones form the church and that we can live the church life on earth today
After we have been saved and regenerated, we must hold on to God's grace, enjoying all that God has prepared for us in His grace
If we fail to do this, not holding on to God's grace and enjoying His riches, we shall suffer loss and punishment
We may say that altogether there are twelve warnings, five in the book of Hebrews and seven in Revelation 2 and 3
Of course, with each of these warnings there is a certain amount of promise, for if we heed the warnings, we shall receive a prize
Hebrews 1026 says For when we sin willfully after receiving the full knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins
For the Hebrew believers not to attend the meetings with the believers in Christ meant that they had forsaken the church
If the Hebrew believers would forsake the church, they would suffer the punishment which is intended for the adversaries
Verse 8 says that 'if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are bastards and not sons'
When He disciplines us, our eternal salvation is even more secure because He is dealing with us as His dear sons, not as bastards
It means that we have the grace already and that we must be diligent not to lose it, not to fall from the grace that we are already enjoying
If the Hebrew believers would go back to Judaism, they would fall away from the grace which all the believers in Christ were enjoying
The birthright in Christ, which includes the kingship in the coming kingdom, means a great deal to the believers
We may sell our birthright for just a small enjoyment of the material things just as Esau sold his for the enjoyment of a morsel of meat
If the Hebrew Christians would forsake the grace in Christ for a little morsel of Judaism, they would lose their birthright in Christ
Since we are in the process of receiving such an unshakable kingdom, we must hold fast to grace and not fall from it
Since the Hebrew Christians were wandering, the writer encouraged them to enter into this present Sabbath rest in the proper church life
The church life will feed us, edify us, build us up, and qualify us for the next Sabbath, which will be the kingdom age
If they missed the church life, they would be like their fathers who wandered in the wilderness, fell there, and died
We need to escape Judaism, Protestantism, worldliness, and the wilderness, and flee into the refuge of the church life
Hebrews 3:12 says, 'Beware, brothers, lest there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in withdrawing from the living God'
The children of Israel did not reason according to the truth but according to the lie, not counting on the ways of God
The children of Israel should have believed this word and known God's ways, saying, 'God, You should not let us die here in the wilderness
Joshua and Caleb stood against that kind of reasoning, declaring that the people were well able to take the land
The Greek word translated 'withdrawing' in 3:12 may also be rendered as turning away, deserting, departing, standing aloof
God was forced into not doing anything for the Israelites because He could not do anything against Himself or against His principles
The writer of the book of Hebrews was fully in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and understood what was written in Psalm 95
The blessing of the Sabbath which was withheld due to the hardening of their hearts was opened again on the day the church came into being
If in the day of the church, we hear His voice and do not harden our heart, we shall never provoke and desert the living God
Whenever we read the Bible, it must be living, energizing, and sharp enough to divide and discern all the things within us
Sometimes, when you are calm, deep within, your spirit is telling you to go on and follow Christ as today's Messiah
In the calm of the night, something deeper than our mind stirred within us, saying, 'The church life is right'
We only found rest when one day the living word of God came in to divide our being, revealing what was our spirit and what was our soul
Only when the merciful and faithful God comes in with the piercing of the living word of God do we find deliverance from our wandering mind
Once we experience the living word of God, it is easy to discern the thoughts that are not of God and the intents that are of Satan
Luke 9:25 says, 'For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away'?
We are all familiar with the function of the conscience, which is to perceive right from wrong and to condemn or justify
To worship God is to contact God and fellowship with Him, proving that the function of worship or fellowship is in our spirit
Our soul can know things by reason and by circumstantial experiences, but the human spirit can discern things without these
We do have the scriptural ground for saying that the conscience, fellowship, and intuition are the three functions of the human spirit
That the will is a part of the heart is proved by Acts 11:23, which speaks of 'purpose of heart' or 'purpose in the heart'
In John 16:6 the Lord speaks of sorrow filling the disciples' hearts, again proving that emotion is found in the heart
We have adequate scriptural ground to prove that the three parts of the soul and the first part of the spirit compose the heart
God's temple, or tabernacle, is composed of three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies
Wherever there is Bethel, there is the gate of heaven with Christ, the heavenly ladder, joining earth to heaven and bringing heaven to earth
We should no longer stagger in our mind but get into our spirit where we have the house of God, the heavenly Christ, and the gate of heaven
As we pointed out in the last message, the church life is our refuge because the church is God's habitation in our spirit
The writer of Hebrews seemed to be saying My dear Hebrew brothers you must turn from your soul to your spirit through the living word of God
Once you get into the spirit you will be in the house of God and will enjoy all the riches of the gate of heaven'
It is not easy to understand this portion of the Holy Word because it requires a good deal of experience on our part
We may not like a particular elder or a certain brother or sister, thinking that they are unqualified, too strong, or too loud
When our devilish mind is exposed, we shall declare that we love all the brothers and sisters because they are all so lovely in the spirit
Those that have forsaken the church life, having left today's Sabbath, can testify that there is no rest outside the church
When the word pierces our depths, we see that our thoughts and intents are altogether selfish and we judge ourselves
When they made their exodus out of Egypt and crossed the Red Sea, they were saved from Egyptian slavery and tyranny
Although they had been saved from God's judgment and from Pharaoh's slavery, what about God's eternal purpose?
Although they had had a sweet enjoyment of Christ, typified by the lamb in Egypt, that was merely the initial stage, the beginning
They had to enjoy, partake of, and experience Christ more, as typified by the manna and the rock flowing with living water
If they had not entered into the land of Canaan, they would never have enjoyed the rich produce of the good land
Salvation from Egypt, through the wilderness, and into the good land is absolutely for God's expression and kingdom
We clearly see that the three stages of God's salvation are for His expression and kingdom so that God may have rest with His saved people
The Passover lamb, the heavenly manna, the living water, and the good land of Canaan are all types of the different aspects of Christ
According to the type of the salvation of the children of Israel, the salvation of the new testament believers is also in three stages
The salvation offered in Christianity is mainly a salvation with justification by faith through the blood of Christ, but without an exodus
Today there are millions of real Christians who have been justified by faith through the blood of Christ but who are still in the world
The second stage of our salvation is salvation through the soul, which includes being sanctified and being transformed
The New Testament reveals that after we have been justified and regenerated, we need to be sanctified and transformed
We praise the Lord that in the past years many saints in the Lord's recovery have been brought into the actuality of such a transformation
Although there has been some outward adjustment and correction, our trust is not in this but in the Lord's marvelous transforming work
We do not need to correct the saints very much, although we do need to take care of the young ones in the way of life
We must all leave the wilderness and cross the river into our spirit, where we enjoy Christ as our life and where we should live and walk
They were wandering in the soul by wondering in the mind and were in danger of drifting back to the first stage
To enter into the rest of the good land is to enter into the church life with the expectation of being ushered into the coming kingdom
In our spirit, we have God's habitation, the heavenly ladder, the gate of heaven, the throne of God, and the Holy of Holies
In the spirit, we enjoy the church life and are in the present Sabbath which will usher us into the Sabbath rest in the coming kingdom
In 4:11 the writer said, 'Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience'
As the rest covered in this portion of the Word is the all-inclusive Christ, so to fall from it is to fall from Christ
In Galatians, the danger was that the Galatian believers would drift into the bondage of law from the liberty of grace
If they still staggered in their old religion, that is, in Judaism, they would come short of Christ, who is their rest
Hebrews 3:7 through 4:11 refers to the children of Israel falling away from entering into the rest of the good land
The receivers of this book, the Hebrew believers, were at that time wondering what they should do with their old Jewish religion
Now we come to another subsection in this book where we find still another comparison-the comparison between Christ and Aaron
Our God is more excellent than the God whom the Jews worship, and our Christ is much superior to the angels, Moses, and Aaron
In the previous chapters we have seen that Christ is the Son of God, the Son of Man, the Captain of our salvation, and the Apostle
If we would know what it means for Christ to be our High Priest, we must thoroughly cover the whole book of Hebrews
The Christ who is in the Holy of Holies is not merely our Savior, Redeemer, Apostle, or Captain of salvation; He is our High Priest
As we have seen in a previous message, the major function of the High Priest is to minister God into God's chosen people
He also wore the breastplate in which were set twelve precious stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel
We should not be content to remain outer court Christians; neither should we be Christians staggering in the Holy Place
Romans 8:34 says that Christ is at the right hand of God interceding for us, and Romans 8:10 says that Christ is also within us
There are not two Christs, one in the heavens and one within us; neither is it a matter of one Christ at two different times
Just as the electricity in the power plant is joined to our homes, so the Christ in the third heaven is joined to our spirit
Christ today is such an excellent, marvelous, wonderful, glorious, and most honorable High Priest that no human word can fully describe Him
He not only knows the things of God and the things of man; He is also in the things of God and the things of man
He has given us the Sabbath rest in the church age, and He will bring us into the Sabbath rest of the kingdom age
His attainment is so high that He has entered into the Holy of Holies in the heavens and has been crowned with glory and honor
He is no longer on earth bearing the crown of thorns; He is now in the highest heavens wearing the crown of glory
Our High Priest, Christ, who is great in His Person, qualification, work, accomplishment, and attainment, has passed through the heavens
After He was crucified and before He was resurrected, Christ walked through Hades, having a good sightseeing tour
Although Satan and all the powers of death tried to hold Him, at the time of His resurrection, He arose from the grave
As we shall see, we simply need to come forward to the throne of grace on which He is sitting and receive mercy and find grace
When we do this, we are immediately in the Sabbath rest of the church life, waiting with Him for the better Sabbath to come
As the One who has been tried in all respects like us, our High Priest, Christ, is able to sympathize with our weaknesses
He is easily touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and quickly enters into a fellow-suffering with us in our weaknesses
The throne of God is the throne of authority to all the universe on which God sits to control and rule over the universe
Within this river grows the tree of life, revealing that the rich Christ with the living Spirit flows out of the throne of grace
The secret is in verse 12 of the same chapter which speaks of the dividing of the soul and spirit by the living and operative word of God
If we are a soulish person staggering in the wilderness of our soul, we shall be far away from the Holy of Holies
For this, we need the living word of God to pierce into the depths of our being and separate our spirit from our wandering mind
It takes no time whatever to enter into the Holy of Holies, because there is no distance between it and our spirit
Whenever we say from the depths of our being, 'O Lord Jesus,' we are immediately in the Holy of Holies, touching the throne of grace
When we are in a pitiful condition, firstly His mercy reaches us and brings us into a state where God is able to favor us with His grace
Every day the help which comes from this grace is very timely; it is always new and exactly fits our situation and need
In this message we need to see that the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec is the cause of eternal salvation
As we shall see, He is not a High Priest according to the old priestly system, the order of Aaron, but according to the order of Melchisedec
He did not glorify Himself to become a High Priest; He was ordained by God in His resurrection, according to the order of Melchisedec
Sympathizing with our weaknesses, He is able to exercise forbearance toward us, the ignorant and straying ones
For Christ to be our High Priest, He must partake of our humanity, as mentioned in 2:14-18, and enter with this humanity into resurrection
Offered up petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him Who was able to save Him out of death'
When He entered into the air, as Colossians 2:15 reveals, He stripped off the principalities and powers and made a show of them
When Christ was ascending through the air, the principalities and powers came, like insects, to prevent Him from ascending
The attraction of the earth, the demons, the principalities and powers, and all negative things have been overcome by Him
Aaron was established in honor to be the high priest only for his lifetime, for he was prevented by death from continuing
According to the Bible, there are only two orders of the priesthood-the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec
Because mankind under the headship of Adam had become a land of idols, even the Almighty God found it impossible to do anything with them
Although He gave up the created race, He could never forsake His eternal purpose which needed man for its fulfillment
According to His economy, God called Abraham out of the fallen created race, making him the head of the called race
In the eyes of God, everything, whether it was moral or immoral, ethical or unethical, good or bad, high or low, was an idol
Melchisedec ministered bread and wine to Abraham, and the Lord Jesus ministered bread and wine to His disciples
If we would understand any item in the Bible, we must consider it at its source, the place where it is first mentioned in the Scriptures
Although Melchisedec was a king, he did not come as a king but as the priest of the Most High God, coming to Abraham with bread and wine
He was processed on the cross that He might be our life supply with the redeeming wine to quench our thirst under God's condemnation
According to the book of Hebrews, Christ offered Himself as the unique sacrifice for sin and solved the problem of sin once for all
He brought His blood into the Holy of Holies in the heavens and sprinkled it in the presence of God, thereby accomplishing redemption
It unveils a Christ who is no longer only a Redeemer offering the sacrifice for sin to God and shedding His blood for our sins
The Christ revealed in this book is the One who, after accomplishing all this, comes to us in a mysterious way
As He comes in our spirit, He does not come as our Redeemer but as our High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec
We have righteousness and peace, but righteousness and peace alone cannot satisfy us; we need something to eat and drink
Based upon God's righteousness and peace, our Melchisedec ministers the bread and wine for us to eat and drink
Such an eternal salvation is not limited by time and space, but is all-embracing with the divine element and nature
The very Person of Christ as our High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec is the cause of our eternal salvation
Do not be afraid of your wife or husband, because Christ, as our High Priest, is the cause of your eternal salvation
As our Melchisedec, the cause of eternal salvation, He ministers Himself to us as bread and wine, and we eat and drink of Him
May we all be helped to see that the table symbolizes that our Christ today is our Melchisedec who ministers to us the bread and the wine
Hebrews 5:13 says that 'everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe'
Concerning Melchisedec he had 'much to say' which was 'hard to interpret' since the receivers of this epistle had 'become dull of hearing'
Although they should have been teachers, at the time of the writing of this epistle, they still needed someone to teach them
The Bible is a book of teaching, but it does not teach us merely for mental knowledge; its teaching ministers food to us
The aim of the Bible is not for our mental comprehension and knowledge; it is absolutely for our spiritual realization and nourishment
The New Testament not only tells us that we must feed ourselves with the word of God but that we must feed others with it
The Greek word translated 'rudiments,' which also may be rendered as 'primary elements,' denotes elementary things
The 'rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God' in 5:12 are 'the word of the beginning of the Christ' in 6:1
It is not the Bible printed with black and white letters as God revealed; it is the 'Bible' printed with their kind of mentality
Even many Christians misinterpret these verses, taking eternal life to mean blessing and happiness in a heavenly merry land
The book of Hebrews is not constructed with God's love; it is constructed basically with God's righteous government
Because of this, not many of those who came out of Egypt during the time of the exodus entered into the good land of Canaan
Consider, for example, the way in which God dealt with Miriam, Moses' older sister, who had criticized him for marrying an Ethiopian woman
The word regarding God's governmental dealings is the word of righteousness, not the word of grace nor the word of life
In 3:15, a quotation from Psalm 95, we are told, 'Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the provocation'
Some would not take the word of righteousness which unveils the truth that a saved person can be cast into outer darkness
If we build according to the human, fleshly, and earthly way, we shall be building with wood, hay, and stubble
While most Christians only want candies in this LifeStudy of Hebrews we are burdened to care for the solid food the word of righteousness
Revelation 2:10 speaks of the crown of life, and 1 Peter 5:4 mentions a crown of glory, but here Paul refers to the crown of righteousness
These senses, implying both our mind and our spirit, discriminate the distinction between the different kinds of words of God
We need to discern, to discriminate, God's word as we do food, asking whether a particular word is like milk or solid food
The first item of each pair refers to our emergence from a negative situation, and the last speaks of our entering into the positive things
It is the same in principle as the New Testament baptism, that is, the washing away and terminating of the negative things
Whenever a sacrifice was offered in the ancient times the offerer laid his hands upon it signifying that he was identifying himself with it
Only when they all have been resurrected will they be judged, and through that judgment they will be brought into eternity
The writer of this epistle was encouraging the Hebrew believers to go on from this word to the word of righteousness
Today many Christians do not even adequately know the word of the beginning of Christ, much less the word of righteousness
We have been baptized and have been identified with Christ and we are assured that there will be resurrection and judgment to come
Suppose the brothers who are building a new meeting hall have laid the foundation, but have become frustrated and have stopped working
After they are stirred up to continue working on the meeting hall, should they start over from the beginning and lay another foundation?
Although doing such a thing would be foolish, many Christians, including myself, have done this very thing in their Christian life
Most of the so-called revivals in today's Christianity only stir up people to go back and lay another foundation again and again
To go on simply means to cross the river, to go from one side to another, from one stage to another, from one standing to another
As we have seen in the previous message, the word of the beginning of Christ is the milk for the babes in Christ
We must go on from the baby stage to maturity by feeding on the solid food, which is the word of righteousness ministered to us in this book
If we fall away after being saved, we do not need to go back to repent of the things which we have repented of already
If after falling away we come back and desire to go on with the Lord, we do not need to repeat our old repentance
If we fall away after we have begun, we do not need to go back to the beginning and start again; we only need to go on from where we fell
They claim that Hebrews 6 says that if we sin after believing in the Lord, it is impossible for us to repent and be forgiven
It means that after you have repented once and have been stirred up to go on with the Lord, you do not need to repent again
Verse 1 indicates that this is not needed; verse 4 says that it is not possible; and verses 7 and 8 show that it is not right
The word 'power' in verse 5 refers to the divine power, and the 'coming age' refers to the age of the coming kingdom
At the time of the believers' regeneration , they all tasted this divine power that caused them to be restored, renewed, and revived
It would not only be wrong for the brothers to lay the foundation for the meeting hall once it had been laid; it would also be a waste
The believers, as the earth, are tilled for God's sake that they might bring forth Christ as the vegetation to maturity
Strictly speaking, the thorns and thistles in verse 8 refer to the traditional things of the old religion of the Hebrew Christians
The Greek word translated 'disapproved' may also be rendered 'disqualified,' 'counted worthless,' 'rejected,' 'cast away'
If any believer would not be brought on to maturity but rather would fall back to the old things, he will be disapproved of by God
The believers can never be burned, but all they bring forth that is not according to God's economy will be burned
We do not need to be that concerned about the coming kingdom in the future; we simply need to get into the church life today
We all need to practice coming forward to the throne of grace that 'we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help'
In order to grow into maturity we need to enjoy such a God-ministering Christ that we may participate in the riches of the divine element
Most Christians stay on the baby food, not desiring the solid food and not experiencing anything of Christ as their Melchisedec
The beginning of chapter six is a strong conclusion encouraging us to practice all we have heard in the five foregoing chapters
Now we come to the capstone of all we have covered in these messages-fleeing into the refuge with the anchor and the Forerunner
The Greek word translated 'have fled for refuge' means to flee intensively; it refers to an intensified fleeing
The Greek word is the same word used in Acts 14:6, where we are told that the Apostle Paul fled the persecution in the city
We must flee the department stores, the course of this age, religion, our old concepts, and every kind of tradition
The writer seemed to be saying, 'Hebrew Christians, you are in a very dangerous situation and you need to flee to a safeguard'
Although it is difficult to say definitely what the refuge is, we may say that it is the heavenlies where the Lord Jesus is today
According to the context of 6:9-20, the writer, using the word 'anchor,' pictures us all as being on a stormy sea
By Gods promise and oath both of which are unchangeable we have our faith and patience issuing in our hope which is the anchor of our soul
Our hope as a secure and firm anchor has entered into the Holy of Holies within the veil and holds on to it and we may now enter in spirit
To say that every situation is a stormy sea simply means that it can hold you back, keeping you from entering into today's rest
As the Forerunner, He has cut the way to glory, and as the Captain, He has entered into glory, into the Holy of Holies within the veil
He fled everything to enter into the presence of God within the veil, where we anchor our hope with full assurance
After covering so many messages thus far in our Life-study of Hebrews, we must pay attention to this one thing-fleeing
The book of Hebrews has two main sections, and these two sections are based upon the two aspects of Christ's priesthood
Christ is the High Priest of God typified by Aaron, and secondly He is the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec
Christ's ministry is of two main aspects, the one typified by Aaron on earth and the other according to the order of Melchisedec in heaven
To the end of chapter six, what is mainly revealed is Christ's work on earth typified by the priesthood of Aaron
We may say that the forgiveness of sin is on the ground floor and that the overcoming of sin is on the second floor
Every saved Christian can testify that he has fully, successfully, absolutely, and thoroughly experienced the forgiveness of sin
How wonderful it is to be on the second floor enjoying not only the forgiveness of sin but also the overcoming of sin!
Although in terminology it sounds like a small thing to speak of the overcoming of sin, in experience it is tremendous
Although we have participated in Christ's work on the cross, we must now press on to enter into the enjoyment of His ministry on the throne
Not many readers of Hebrews have seen this point clearly, but by God's mercy and grace He has shown us this turn
There was the tabernacle, which was divided into two parts-the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies where God's presence was
The outer court is for people to enter the Holy of Holies, and the Holy Place is the threshold of the Holy of Holies
The book of Hebrews turns us from the altar in the outer court to the place of God's oracle in the Holy of Holies
Although you might have lost your temper with your wife this morning now as you are reading this message you can be at the throne of grace
Have you not enjoyed grace in this way, as the very God flowing into, through, and out of you to do everything for you?
Many who are still on the pathway need the book of Hebrews to turn them to the glorified Christ on the throne of God
Although many know that Christ is our High Priest, very few realize that with Christ's priesthood there are two aspects
Now we must press on to enter into the full participation in His priesthood according to the order of Melchisedec
We shall be on the second floor, in the Holy of Holies, having nothing to do with sin but continually enjoying grace
Based upon the two aspects of Christs priesthood there are two sections of Christs ministrythe section on earth and the section in heaven
Wait for a few years, the next age, or, at the latest, for eternity, and you will see that you have been sanctified unto God
What glad tidings it is to hear that we have been separated to God through the offering of Christ with His blood!
Regardless of how weak, young, or new you are, you have been perfected and completed by Christ through His offering
After Christ offered Himself as the sin offering and made propitiation and purification for our sins, He consummated the new covenant for us
We should not only be concerned about sin, for, due to the fall of Adam, everything of the old creation is out of order
According to the new map, the way from the cross to the throne is a highway paved by the suffering Jesus and the glorified Christ
On earth, Christ cut the pathway of the cross, and in heaven He has opened a new and living way into the Holy of Holies
As the heavenly Minister, Christ ministers heaven, life, and power into us that we may live the heavenly life on earth
, the preachers, pastors, and ministers have been telling people for years to look to the Lord who is in heaven
As we pointed out in the last message, the Lord today is no longer here on earth but is on the throne in heaven
If He were only in heaven, He would be too far away from us for us to have Him as our life and our daily life supply
It is used several times in Hebrews: 'come forward to the throne of grace' ; 'come forward to the Holy of Holies ; 'come forward to God'
As we have already seen clearly, the recipients of this book, the Hebrew believers, were in danger of shrinking back
At the time of the writing of this book, the writer was there in the Holy of Holies, calling the Hebrew brothers to come forward
If you were to ask many Christians where the Holy of Holies and the throne of grace are, they would say that they are in heaven
We need to ask this question: If the throne of grace is in heaven and we are on earth, how can we come forward to it?
In this place there is the ladder joining earth and heaven , and on this ladder the angels of God are ascending and descending
Between earth and heaven there is a great deal of traffic, as indicated by the angels' ascending and descending
An electrical power plant may be far away from your home, but between your home and the power plant there is the traffic of electricity
Immediately, that very place is joined to heaven, for there is a ladder joining earth to heaven and bringing heaven down to earth
How can the objective electricity far away in the power plant become the subjective application of electricity in our homes?
The electricity is objectively in the power plant, but in application, it is subjectively present in our homes
We must say that, in fact, Christ is objectively in the heavens, but, in our experience, He is subjectively in our spirit
Because this second floor is joined to our spirit, we must turn to our spirit to experience the very Christ who is in heaven
The book of Hebrews is focused on the heavenly Christ, and the chief point of this heavenly Christ is that He is the High Priest
The main point here is not that Christ is the Savior or Redeemer but that He, as the heavenly Christ, is the High Priest
As the priest of the Most High God, Melchisedec did not offer sacrifices to God for Abraham's sin; he ministered bread and wine to him
As indicated by the symbols of the Lord's table in the Bible bread and wine signify the processed God as our supply
In the book of Leviticus we need to appreciate Aaron, but when we come to Hebrews, we must say that Aaron is past
Melchisedec is also the king of Salem, which means the king of peace, signifying that Christ is also the King of peace
Do you believe that before Melchisedec came to Abraham and ministered the processed God to him, God did not come to Abraham?
According to Genesis 14:22, before Abraham went out to fight the battle, he lifted up his hand to the Most High God
After Abraham had slaughtered the enemies and Melchisedec had come to meet him, there was righteousness and peace
If you read Hebrews 7 again, you will see that the Christ who ministers as the High Priest is the interceding One
As you are fighting during the day, slaughtering the negative things, Christ, the High Priest, is interceding for you
The Bible does not need to tell us certain things because if you see the front side you automatically know the back side
Psalm 110 is the bridge that brings us from Genesis 14 to the book of Hebrews, passing over the book of Leviticus
The book of Hebrews, being concerned with the heavenly Christ as our High Priest, refers to this psalm a number of times
It was in such an environment and condition of righteousness and peace that Melchisedec ministered the bread and wine to the victor
Eventually our environment and condition will be full of righteousness and peace and our Melchisedec will appear to have a good time with us
It is such a Christ who is the kingly, royal High Priest ministering the processed God to us as our daily supply
All the Levitical priests are lesser than Melchisedec, and the order of Aaron is inferior to that of Melchisedec
Our High Priest, Christ, today does not offer sacrifices for sin but ministers the processed God to the victorious fighters
Although He is a High Priest, He did not come out of the tribe of the priests but out of the tribe of the kings-Judah
If Christ is to minister the processed God to us as our bread and wine, there must be an environment that is full of righteousness and peace
Whenever we come to the Lord's table, we need to have the deep sensation that we are in a condition of righteousness and peace
In such a case, there would be no righteousness and peace, and there would be no ministering of the bread and wine to us
On the one hand, the priesthood of Christ is the absence of death; on the other hand, it is the presence of life
As the kingly High Priest, Christ ministers the processed God to us, and as the divine High Priest, wherever He is, life is present
In 7:2 we have the King of righteousness and the King of peace, and in 7:28 we have 'the Son, Who is perfected forever'
Most Christians only know that the Son of God is the Only Begotten Son, but the Bible says that He is also the Firstborn Son
The Firstborn Son, who according to Psalm 2 and Acts 13:33 was born as such on the day of resurrection, has both divinity and humanity
Although the Only Begotten Son was wonderful, He had only divinity but not humanity, which is necessary for Him to be our High Priest
In the way of having His divinity incarnated into humanity, living on the earth, going into death, and coming out of death in resurrection
Having passed through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, He is fully equipped and qualified for the divine priesthood
There is no need to say that those priests were unable to save others; they were even unable to save themselves
Regardless of our situation or the condition in which we may find ourselves, we can tell Satan, 'Satan, do your best
All the men who were priests in the Old Testament were fragile, subject to death, but the Son of God is eternal, living forever
He is the Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son of God as the very life that constitutes the priesthood of the new covenant
The priesthood has been transferred from men to such a One, to the Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son of God
In such a One we have the divine birth of the Firstborn Son of God, the birth that produced the many sons of God
Christ has not been constituted High Priest according to the law of letters but according to the power of an indestructible life
By the Lord's mercy, we have crossed the river from the other side, the side of letters, to this side, the side of life
The commandment, or the regulations, of the law concerning the Levitical priesthood has been disannulled because of its weakness in letters
Christ's being the Only Begotten Son as well as the Firstborn Son of God are both qualifications for Him to be the High Priest
Christ's becoming our High Priest depends upon both His being the Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son of God
It is an endless life, being the eternal, divine, uncreated, resurrection life that has passed through the test of death and Hades
As the Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son of God, Christ became the High Priest with the taking of an oath by God
That Christ has become the Surety of a better covenant is based upon the fact that He is the living and perpetual High Priest
He is the bondsman, the guarantee that He will do everything that is necessary for the fulfillment of the new covenant
Once the hand has pledged itself to the arm, it becomes the surety to guarantee that it will do everything for the arm
Even if the hand does not want to do things for the arm, it must do them nonetheless because it has pledged itself to the arm
Whether or not your physical life wants to do things for you, it has to do them because it has pledged itself to do them
Whether we understand this or not and whether He is willing to do it or not, He must do it because He has pledged Himself
The new covenant, the covenant enacted on the law of life, can never fail because Christ is the Surety of this covenant
Christ is not only the consummator of the new covenant; He is also the Surety, the pledge that everything in it will be fulfilled
The word translated uttermost also means completely, entirely, perfectly, for all time and eternity, and to the end
Because He lives forever without any change, Christ is able to save us to the uttermost in extent, in time, and in space
He appears before God on our behalf, praying for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose
If this does not happen today or tomorrow, it may happen next year, in the next age, or, at the latest, in the new heaven and the new earth
To say that Christ's priesthood is kingly is not too difficult to grasp because the logic there is not that deep
To say that Christs divine priesthood is constituted with life having life as its element essence component and constituent is very deep
Offering solves the problem of sin, ministering imparts the processed God to us as our daily supply, and saving rescues us to the uttermost
When we mention God, we must think of Him as the One who has been processed and imparted to us to be our daily supply
In God's eternal plan, God intended to dispense Himself into man to be man's everything that man might become His complete expression
Because of man's fall, sin came in to frustrate and damage God's purpose of ministering Himself into man as man's daily supply
The Aaronic priesthood solves the problem of sin, whereas the kingly priesthood fulfills God's eternal purpose
According to the broadest understanding of death in the Bible, death includes vanity, corruption, sighing, groaning, and decay
The whole universe has been polluted by death, which is the result of the sin that came in through Adam, the head of the old creation
When many people come home from dancing or from a sporting event, they find that the inward groaning is still there
Because of the issues of death, we need the divine priesthood, which is the presence of life and the absence of death
When you visit the homes of some of the dear saints in the church, you see nothing but vanity, corruption, groaning, and decay
When your home is filled with the divine priesthood of Christ, there is the absence of death and the presence of life
When you come to my home, there should be praising, reality, building up, and growth, not groaning, vanity, corruption, and decay
The divine Son of God was incarnated, lived on earth, passed through death, was resurrected, and has been fully perfected forever
Christ, the perfected One, is able to save us from all of these by-products of death and to bring us into His perfection
On the second floor, we are enjoying Christ's kingly priesthood in which He ministers God as our enjoyment for our daily supply
When we came into the church life and began to say 'Amen,' we were told, 'You should not say amen so loudly or shout hallelujah
Praise the Lord that today our level has been elevated to that of the kingly priesthood and the divine priesthood!
As our Forerunner, Christ has already entered into that complete perfection, and we also shall be brought there
The kingly priesthood is for the building of the church, for it is the kingly priesthood that maintains the order of righteousness and peace
While the unbelievers are alienated cut off from the life of God we are attached joined to it for God has pledged His life into our being
We must forget all the human teachings that say we need good ethics and behavior and focus on what we really need-the life of God
Today we have the highest life not the vegetable life the animal life the angelic life or even just the human lifewe have the divine life!
A number of times the King James Version says everlasting life instead of eternal life, but this translation misses the mark
Eternal life is a super life, a life without beginning or end, a life without the limitations of time and space
Life can enable the brothers and sisters in the local churches to love one another to the uttermost, to perfection
Resurrection life is life that has been tested by and has passed through death, proving that death is unable to do anything with it
Our life today is the resurrection life, the life that has passed through death and has proved that death cannot hold it down
Where life is, there the Spirit is because the Spirit is the essential reality, actuality, and practicality, of this life
Romans 5:10 says that we have been reconciled through the death of Christ and shall be saved by the saving life of Christ
Corruption is a by-product of death, but the divine priesthood, being constituted with the indestructible life, diminishes all corruption
Certain chemical compounds can be dissolved by placing them in a particular liquid, but nothing can dissolve this indestructible life
If you put this life into the grave, the grave will burst, and if you place it into Hades, Hades will be powerless to hold it down
The life that we have received is an indestructible life, and nothing on earth, in heaven, or in hell can deal with it
We have seen the two sections of Christ's ministry: the Aaronic section on earth and the kingly and divine section in heaven
It is one thing to overcome sin and death and quite another thing, a most crucial thing, to eliminate these by-products of death
In Romans 3 through 8 we can see three steps of God's economical salvation: justification, sanctification, and glorification
Justification is related to God's righteousness, sanctification to God's holiness, and glorification to God's glory
As we pointed out in the last message, to be glorified is to have our being completely saturated with Christ's divine priesthood
Salvation to the uttermost not only rescues us from sin and death but also diminishes and swallows up all the by-products of death
When all the by-products of death are swallowed up, that will be the time of the manifestation of the sons of God in glory
Abraham and his three hundred eighteen men were bold because they were energized by the intercession of Melchisedec
When Melchisedec came to bless Abraham, he blessed the Most High God for delivering Abraham's enemies into his hands
In other words, Melchisedec was telling Abraham that his victory was the result of his intercession to the Most High God on his behalf
The Lord is opening up His Word to us so that we might be fighters like Abraham and his three hundred eighteen men
The motor in the third heavens energizes the machine on the earth: it makes a lot of 'pum, pum, pums' in our spirit
Whenever we pray for the Lord's recovery, we have the deep sense that the Lord's intercession is empowering us from within
Christ's heavenly ministry is not a ministry that takes care of pitiful sinners; it is the more excellent ministry operating God's economy
Although the Bible has been on earth for centuries, few Christians, if any, have seen the things that we are seeing today
Hebrews 8:1 says that we have a 'High Priest, Who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens'
He is not our Aaron standing on earth but our Melchisedec sitting in the heavens, even on the throne of God with the divine majesty
In God's economy three things are always combined: the tabernacle, or the sanctuary, the priesthood, and the law
The sanctuary, priesthood, and law that we enjoy today are much better than the old sanctuary, priesthood, and law
Hebrews 8:2 says that Christ is a 'Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man'
Christ, as the Mediator, is the Executor in resurrection of the new covenant, the new testament, which He bequeathed to us by His death
The covenant which was enacted for us and bequeathed to us as the new testament by Christ is a better covenant
As we shall see later, every fact in the new covenant is made effective by the heavenly Minister with His more excellent ministry
Facts refer to certain things that have been accomplished but which are not yet designated until they are bequeathed
What were facts in the covenant have now become legally designated for us as bequests in the will, in the testament
In one sense, this caused God a great deal of trouble, but, in another sense, it afforded Him a good opportunity to manifest His wisdom
Before God did these four things, He firstly promised His people that He would do them by making a covenant with them
If God had immediately made such a new covenant, the people would not have been impressed with it or able to understand it
All of the four items of the new covenant were found in the old covenant in the way of shadows, not in the way of reality
As we consider the matters of the old and new covenant, we must know the difference between a promise, an oath, a covenant, and a testament
Now the covenant is no longer merely a covenant but a testament bequeathed by the One who enacted the covenant
We do not need to wait for the accomplishment of these things or to pray that God will be faithful to remember His promise and keep His word
These four items are not only promises and facts but also bequests that we may inherit, participate in, and enjoy
What we have today is not a promise or even merely a covenant, but a testament, a will, which is an advanced covenant
When the promise has been fulfilled, it becomes the covenant, and when the covenant has been bequeathed, it becomes the testament
All of the promises have become accomplished facts, and all of the accomplished facts have been bequeathed to us
Whenever we brothers try to vindicate ourselves, the divine presence immediately disappears, and we know that such vindication is not of God
We do not need any teaching according to the law of letters in order to know this; we have an inward ability in life to know God
Many of the Judaizers were just this foolish, dealing with the picture, the old covenant, and expecting much from it in return
The prophecy of Jeremiah came about because fault, weakness, and unprofitableness were found in the old covenant
When Jeremiah prophesied of the coming new covenant, that indicated that the old covenant had become old and decrepit
It might have been that Jeremiah realized the weakness and unprofitableness of the covenant and was deeply burdened about this matter
Not only was the old covenant decrepit, but it was also near to disappearing and eventually was disannulled, abolished
The new covenant is better than the old covenant, just as the reality of a person is better than his photograph
Everything in the new covenant is much better than the things in the old covenant because everything in the new covenant is the reality
In these better promises there is the forgiveness of sins, not just the covering of sins as under the Mosaic law
The forgiveness of sins, being the putting away of sins, is better than the covering of sins, which never removed the sins
The old covenant had fault and became old, decrepit, and near to disappearing, and the new covenant has been consummated to replace it
In Jeremiah 31:33, the source of this quotation, the word laws is singular, proving that it is one law that spreads into a number of laws
Gradually, as we have been growing in this life, this life has had the opportunity to develop from our spirit into all of our inward parts
The law of dead letters depends upon outward teachings, but the law of life depends upon the inward consciousness, the inward sense of life
Since we all, great or small, have this law of life, we do not need outward teachings according to the law of letters
The law of life is imparted into our spirit and from our spirit it spreads into our mind and into all of our inward parts
The more we experience the law of life, the more its laws will be inscribed into the different parts of our heart
God was God to them according to the old law of letters, and they were His people also according to the law of letters
Today we do not need to walk according to the knowledge of the law of letters but according to the consciousness of the law of life
It is very difficult, for example, to find a verse in the New Testament which tells us what time God wants us to get up in the morning
In the new covenant there is also the function of the law of life by which we know God in the inward way of life
In John 8:55 the Lord Jesus told the Pharisees that they have not known God the Father , but He knows the Father
The last of the contents of the new covenant is propitiation for our unrighteousnesses and forgiveness of our sins
Christ made propitiation for our sins to appease God's righteousness, to reconcile us by satisfying the demand of God's righteousness
The propitiation for our unrighteousnesses and the forgiveness of our sins give Him the ground to impart His life into us
God's original intention for His eternal purpose was to impart His life into man, but sin came in to frustrate this
The crucial matter in Hebrews 7 was the indestructible life, and the crucial matter here in Hebrews 8 is the law of life
The heavenly tabernacle, the heavenly Minister, and the new covenant are combined for the fulfillment of God's economy in the way of reality
Since the heavenly tabernacle is joined to our spirit, the heavenly Minister of the better covenant is also joined to our spirit
Before we can see what the law of life is, we must consider some other things that are the necessary background for our seeing this
If we see that the New Testament is actually a testament, a will, we shall preach the gospel in the highest way
There is no need for a farmer to teach a peach tree, saying, 'Little peach tree, you must know my desire is that you produce peaches
A cat catches mice because in its life is the mouse-catching law, and a dog barks because in its life is the barking law
In a good and positive sense, His working is His regulating, for the working of the divine life within us is its regulating
The function of the law of life is to take away, to kill, the old element of Adam and to add in, to supply, the new element of Christ
While the law of the divine life works and regulates in our inward parts, it kills and takes away the old things of our natural being
At the same time, it adds in and supplies the divine element of the new creation, bringing the riches of Christ into our being
The regulating of the law of the divine life brings the riches of Christ into our life and forms Christ in our being
He wants us to be His people in the law of life, living not according to the outward law of letter but according to the inward law of life
The divine priesthood saves us to the uttermost, meaning that it brings us into complete perfection, into glorification
Forget about your feelings, understanding, and realization and come back to the pure Word and receive the clear vision
After a few days, the interceding Christ may say of this dear one, 'Father, he is functioning now, but he is not mature
Perhaps this same brother is touched one morning concerning his selfishness, having the deep conviction that he is full of self
He may think that this is the reaction to a certain message, not realizing that this also is a reaction to the heavenly intercession
Whatever happens to us in our spiritual life is either a quotation of the heavenly intercession or a reaction to it
You may think that the renewing of the mind is due to the teachings and messages that you hear in the church life
When your mind is renewed by the law of life, it will be revolutionized, and you will never think the way you did before
Whether our will is naturally stubborn or submissive makes no difference, for neither is useful for the life of Christ
According to our human feeling, we all love a submissive will, but as long as a submissive will is a natural will, it is not adequate
As the law of the divine life works in us, one of its functions will saturate our will with the will of Christ, making His will ours
As the Only Begotten Son of God, He was the embodiment of God, for all that is in the Godhead was embodied in Him
As the embodiment and expression of God, He became incarnated, bringing divinity into humanity and joining humanity to divinity
By His resurrection, He was born with His humanity into the divine sonship and became the Firstborn Son of God
He is a person who has divinity mingled with an uplifted humanity and who has humanity that is one with divinity
Being in glorification is superior to being in glory, because being in glory does not require a process, whereas being in glorification does
The book of Romans reveals that in the economy of God we have firstly justification, then sanctification, and finally glorification
Hebrews 2910 which says that Christ the Captain of our salvation has been crowned with glory refers to both perfection and glorification
The perfection of the glorified Jesus is that of divinity mingled with a humanity that has been tested, resurrected, uplifted, and glorified
After passing through all the tests and after being resurrected and uplifted, the humanity of Jesus was 'sonized'
Although Christ was the Son of God, before His resurrection He was clothed with humanity, which was unrelated to that sonship
When this standard model was resurrected, being born in His humanity to be the Firstborn Son of God, He included us
According to the pure word of the Holy Bible, when Christ was resurrected, He imparted Himself into us as life, and we were reborn
After imparting Himself into us as life, Christ entered into perfection, into glory, where He is now interceding for our glorification
Many pastors use Romans 8:34 and Hebrews 7:25 concerning Christ's interceding to comfort those who are in difficulty
Overcoming sin, having patience, loving others-all this is in a different category of perfection from that revealed in the New Testament
The law of life is working Christ, the standard model, into every part of our being, saturating our inward parts with all that He is
Only by the working of the law of life which saturates us with what the standard model is and makes us a reproduction, a reprint, of Him
Eventually, as Romans 8:29 says, the working of the law of life will conform us to the image of God's Firstborn Son
The Firstborn Son of God, the standard model, is today in perfection and in glorification, but we are not yet there
By the inward 'pum, pum, pum,' the energizing of the heavenly intercession, you realize that you must go to that meeting
The Lord will use the churches and the messages to gather together His true seekers to be His testimony to the whole earth
Since the time of Christ's ascension, God has been working to have a mass reproduction of that standard model, His Firstborn Son
Although there are millions of Christians on earth today, there are not many reproductions of the standard model
When all this has been wrought into us, we shall have a thorough transformation and be completely conformed to His image
When this process has been completed, He will come to redeem our body, transfiguring our vile body into a glorious one
Ephesians 4:22-24 tells us to be renewed in the spirit of our mind that we may put off the old man and put on the new man
We are now in the process of being renewed in the spirit of our mind, and gradually we are putting on the new man
Hebrews 9:1 says, 'Then indeed the first covenant has ordinances of service, and its sanctuary, a sanctuary of this world'
Although it is difficult to realize the true significance of these covenants, it is easy to understand them if we consider the tabernacle
Although a person could find nourishment at the table and enlightenment at the lampstand, he had no way to contact God
No one in the Holy Place could say that there he was meeting with God, for there was no way to meet Him in the Holy Place
When you were in the denominations, did you have either the presence of God or the way to come into His presence?
We need to remember that the book of Hebrews was written to the Hebrew Christians who were staggering in the Holy Place
They were uncertain whether to come forward to the Holy of Holies or to shrink back from the Holy Place to the outer court
The writer of Hebrews was marvelous and full of patience; he did not write superficially but in a very deep way
His writing was so deep that during the past nineteen centuries most of his readers have not fully realized what he said
The golden altar, which was the incense altar, was not in the Holy of Holies, but it belonged to the Holy of Holies
Notice that it does not say that the incense altar was in the Holy of Holies, but that the Holy of Holies had the incense altar
When we pray in the Lord's name with Him as the fragrant resurrection frankincense, we immediately enter into the Holy of Holies
Over the ark was the lid called the propitiation-cover, which was the place of the divine oracle of God's speaking
Are we in that place or in the place where it is so easy to come into Gods presence have His speaking and meet and have fellowship with Him
Some render 'the time then present' for 'the present time,' considering that this refers to the old testament age
In the old testament age there was the law of letters, which was a figure of the law of life in the new testament age
In the old testament age God was God to His people and His people were a people to Him according to the written law
That was a symbol that today in the new testament age God is God to us and we are a people to Him according to the law of life
The Holy Place was a symbol of the old covenant and, at the same time, it was also a type of the new testament age
Since the Holy Place was a symbol of the old covenant, it signified that the old covenant was a type of the new
Because they were of letters outwardly, not of life inwardly, they could only give the worshippers a form, not the slightest amount of life
It exposed the shortcomings of God's worshippers, but it could not perfect them with real things of life in spirit
The Hebrew believers likewise were not clear concerning this at their time and also needed help in this matter
Verse 8 says that at that time the way of the Holy of Holies had not yet been manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing
At that time, the way of the Holy of Holies, that is, the way of the new covenant, had not yet been manifested
We do not need to remain in the Holy Place, the old covenant, in the soul; we must enter the Holy of Holies, the new covenant, in the spirit
The writer seemed to be saying to his readers, 'Hebrew brothers, you should no longer remain in the old covenant
The writer's concept in the book of Hebrews is that the Holy of Holies and the new covenant are one; the Holy of Holies is the new covenant
We have found the key, which is that the Holy of Holies is the new covenant and that the new covenant is the Holy of Holies
If we put all these together, we find that we are in God's presence, at His oracle, and are meeting with God and having fellowship with Him
Although the way into the Holy of Holies was not manifested in the old covenant age, it has been manifested today
When we enter into the Holy of Holies we are in the new covenant enjoying all the bequests of the new covenant which has become a testament
Verse 11 says that Christ has come a 'High Priest of the good things that have come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle'
His offering of Himself was 'once for all' , and the redemption consummated through His death is eternal , having an eternal effect
To worship in dead religion or to serve any dead thing other than God does not require our conscience to be purified
In this message we need to see the experiences of Christ as portrayed by the arrangement of the furniture of the tabernacle
Thank God that this is clearly portrayed in His Holy Word by the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle, His dwelling place
In this message we are not concerned with learning typology which was emphasized by the Brethren teachers more than a century ago
The recovery today is not a recovery of the teachings of typology but a recovery of the experiences of Christ as portrayed in the types
We need to enter into the experiences of Christ as shown in the arrangement of the furniture in God's dwelling place
At the brass altar, which signifies the cross , we participate in Christ mainly as our sin offering and also as all the other offerings
In principle the offerings solve our problems with God fully reconciling us to Him and making our situation with God righteous and peaceful
Although we have experienced Christ as the offerings before we can come into Gods presence we also need to be washed cleansed by the Spirit
When we enter into the Holy Place, the first item of furniture is the showbread table , which signifies Christ as our life supply
For eternity we shall have the life supply, but the purpose of the lampstand is to enable God's people to move and act in the dark age
Most Christian teachers and Bible readers have thought that some error or misconstruction should somehow have occurred
It says that in the early days the incense censer was always put outside the veil but that it gradually slipped into the Holy of Holies
In Exodus 26:35, only the showbread table and the lampstand are mentioned as being in the Holy Place, not the incense altar
Due to all these points, the writer of this book had to reckon that the incense altar belongs to the Holy of Holies
We speak to God in our prayer with Christ as the sweet incense, and God speaks to us in the sweet savor of this incense
Hebrews says that the Holy of Holies has the incense altar, not that the incense altar is in the Holy of Holies
As we experience the incense altar in our prayer, we often begin with our mind and are ushered into the spirit
According to our natural concept, we think that the law is something which regulates us and makes demands and requirements of us
The ark of testimony is a type of Christ, the true testimony of God, who is the embodiment and expression of all God is
In the Holy of Holies, in the innermost part of God's dwelling place, we experience Christ as the ark of God's testimony
In Christ we participate in the divine element, the divine attributes, and even the divine expression of our God
When God caused Aaron's rod to bud, it signified that in resurrection he was authorized to represent God, to be God's deputy authority
As this process transpires within us and the inward law of life works Christ into every part of our being, Christ is formed in us
Of the second three, the showbread table, the lampstand, and the incense altar, the incense altar is the most important
The last and consummate experience of Christ as portrayed by the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle is the inward law of life
Eventually, the consummate point of the experience of Christ is the Spirit of the Triune God in the human spirit of the tripartite man
Come forward to the experience of the rich supply of nourishment at the showbread table and to the enlightenment of the lampstand
The budding rod brings us to the consummate item of Gods economythe inward law of life the working of the Spirit of the Triune God within us
Whether it is translated covenant or testament depends on whether the person who consummated the covenant is living or dead
Many parents, when they know that they soon will die, make a will in which they leave various things to their children
The old covenant was made with the outward law of letters, whereas the new covenant is enacted with this inward law of life
Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God's righteousness that by it the covenant may be enacted
The blood of Christ is the speaking blood, speaking to God for forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, and redemption
In the old covenant the high priest was a mortal man, and his ministry was a shadow of the good things to come
Once the promises have been confirmed by God's oath, having been made unalterable, there is no possibility of repentance or change
After God made His promises in the Old Testament confirming them by His oath the Lord Jesus came and accomplished all that God had promised
After His death and resurrection, the Lord ascended into the heavens, leaving with us the covenant which He had accomplished by His death
No longer do we just have God's word, God's promise, and the new covenant; we also have the new testament, the will
The Bible is a will in which everything has not only been mentioned, promised, and accomplished but also bequeathed
We have seen that after the Lord left the covenant with us it became the new testament containing all the accomplished facts as our bequests
While the Lord is resting on His throne in the heavens, He is concerned for all the heirs of this new testament
Because He is so concerned, He is interceding that we shall have the full realization of all the bequests contained in His bequeathed will
All Christians understand God's salvation in a low way according to the natural human concept, not in the way of bequests
Were you ever taught that the imparting of the divine life, the rebirth, and our crucifixion with Christ are also bequests?
In these verses, there is no begging but praising and thanksgiving, because the Lord has accomplished everything
If we know God's economy, we shall praise the Lord and thank Him for all He has accomplished and bequeathed to us
If our eyes could be opened to see that we have such a will, we would be beside ourselves with praise to the Lord
When my eyes were opened to see this matter of the bequests in the new testament, my whole concept was changed
The testament, the will, has been confirmed and validated by Christ's death and is being executed and enforced by Christ in His resurrection
God's promises have all become accomplished facts in the new covenant, and the new covenant has been bequeathed to us as the new testament
Now, in resurrection as the ascended One sitting on the throne in the heavens, Christ is executing what He has bequeathed
At the end of chapter nine the book of Hebrews itself gives us a summary, a conclusion, of these three chapters
During the long period between the two manifestations of Christ to the world, He remains in the presence of God
Before Christ's incarnation, men like Abraham, Moses, and David had come and gone, but nothing had been accomplished for God's economy
During those thirty-three and a half years, everything necessary for the fulfillment of God's purpose was accomplished
Verse 26 says that 'once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin by His sacrifice'
The Greek words translated 'consummation of the ages' may also be rendered the 'completion of the ages' or 'end of the ages'
It means the end of the old testament age, whereas the consummation of the age in Matthew 28:20 indicates the close of the church age
Christ 'was foreordained' for us 'before the foundation of the world' , and He was 'slain from the foundation of the world'
Perhaps you were born just twenty or thirty years ago, and during your lifetime you have committed many sins, such as stealing and lying
The putting away of sin was accomplished nineteen and a half centuries ago, long before you committed any sins
Hebrews 9:12 says that 'through His own blood' He 'entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, having found an eternal redemption'
In His first manifestation, Christ accomplished everything, put all that He had accomplished into a will, and left His will with us
If your grandfather's will were full of promises and prophecies, it might take eighty years for it to be fulfilled
Everything needed for the completion of God's eternal plan has already been fulfilled by Christ in His first manifestation
After He had finished His work in the outer court, Christ, as the High Priest, entered into the Holy of Holies of the true tabernacle
Christ has entered into the Holy of Holies in the heavens so that He might appear before the face of God for us
We may recall how Melchisedec came to minister the bread and wine to Abraham after he had interceded for him behind the scene
To say this is not guesswork; it is the revelation of God's Holy Word which is shining over us as a heavenly vision
To execute the new testament simply means to motivate the law of life within us and to make every bequest of the new will real in our being
Verse 28 says that Christ 'shall appear to those who wait for Him a second time, apart from sin, unto salvation'
As man must die once and be judged after having died , so Christ died once to bear man's sins and suffered the judgment for man on the cross
Since Christ has put away sin in His first appearing , His second appearing will be apart from sin, having nothing whatever to do with it
Of all, the very salvation which Christ will bring to us in His second manifestation is for the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body
At Christ's second coming for the completion of the salvation of our entire being, He will transfigure our vile body into a glorious one
That will be the redemption of our body , the first aspect of Christ's appearing 'unto salvation' in His second manifestation
At His second coming, Christ will free us from this vanity and slavery and deliver us into the freedom of the glory of the children of God
At His second coming, Christ will glorify us , that is, He will bring us into His glory to fulfill the word in Hebrews 2:10
The more we are transformed in our soul, the more we enjoy the sonship which has been given to us in our spirit
When He sees that the building up of this wonderful salvation has been accomplished, He will appear the second time
10:18, speaking of sins and lawlessnesses, says, 'where forgiveness of these is, there is no longer an offering for sin'
The main thought in 10:1-18 is that Christ has put away sin, accomplishing what all the Levitical sacrifices were unable to do
It is Christ, the reality of all the shadows in the Old Testament, who has accomplished everything for God's economy
Often they offered the same sacrifice for sin, their conscience could never be at peace and they could never be perfected before God
According to God's intention, whenever they offered the sacrifice for sin, they should have looked unto Christ
As the law's sacrifices were a shadow, not the reality, it was impossible for their animal blood to take away sins
It would have been foolish for the Hebrew believers to go back to offer the animal sacrifices which had already been replaced by Christ
Christ, as the real sacrifice for sin which has taken away sins, has sanctified us through the offering of His body once for all
Sin had separated us from God, but Christ, through His redemption, has separated us from sin and has brought us back to God
Verse 11 says, 'Every priest stands daily, ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins'
Although God forgives and forgets our sins, and although we may realize that our sins have been forgiven, we cannot forget them
Since Christ has accomplished the sacrifice for sin and has terminated it, there is no longer any offering for sin
Today we also need to see that our sins have been taken away by the death of Christ and that the problem of sin has been solved once for all
When we enjoy the Christ who is in the heavens, we are truly under the new covenant participating in all the bequests of the new testament
After presenting a complete picture of these things, the writer was very concerned that the Hebrew believers would not go on
He gave them a warning, telling them of the danger of shrinking back to Judaism and not coming forward to the new testament
In 10:22, of course, the phrase 'Holy of Holies' must be in italics, because it is not found in the original Greek text
If you consider the context beginning from verse nineteen, you will see that the meaning certainly is to come forward to the Holy of Holies
God's eternal purpose can only be fulfilled with God sitting on the throne of grace in the Holy of Holies in this new covenant age
Coming forward is not merely a matter of our salvation or even of our glorification; it is for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
For us to be saved or glorified is a small thing, but for God's eternal purpose to be accomplished is a tremendous matter
As we have seen, all the things in the Holy Place, such as the showbread table and the lampstand, are the types of Christ, not the reality
The presence of God, the shekinah glory of God, God's meeting with man, and God's speaking, which are in the Holy of Holies, are all real
They are not types but realities which are fully realized and experienced by us in the new testament dispensation
He is now ministering in 'the greater and more perfect tabernacle' in the heavens to execute the new covenant for God's economy
We enter the Holy of Holies by a 'new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh'
The veil in verse 20 is the second veil within the tabernacle which, as we have seen, typifies the flesh of Christ
If we would turn from our spirit to our flesh, we would no longer be the house of God but a house of scorpions and snakes
When Christians fight and argue with one another, they are not the church, the house of God; they are scorpions and snakes
In chapter nine we saw clearly that the tabernacle was not merely a place but also the symbol of a covenant and an age
The call to come forward to the Holy of Holies includes coming forward to the new covenant and to the new covenant age
As our High Priest with the more excellent ministry of His kingly and divine priesthood, He is our hope in our daily life
Good works here and in 13:21 are the good things which, in the eyes of God, are mainly related to the fulfillment of His purpose
For when we sin willfully after receiving the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins'
For the Hebrew believers to shrink back to Judaism and offer again the sacrifice for sin would be to do something which God had terminated
Verse 29 says, 'By how much do you think he shall be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled under foot the Son of God'
We have seen the old way and the new way, and we have been warned to come forward along the new way and not to shrink back to the old
Under the Lord's light, we have seen that to sin willfully is to give up God's economy and to go back to the old way of traditional religion
The term dispensational punishment is not likely to be found in other Christian books or messages for it is a new term in the Lords recovery
According to this school, once we have been saved, we are saved eternally, regardless what we do after we are saved
Most of the so-called holiness churches belong to this school, believing that a person may be saved and lost again and again
Because their salvation goes up and down like an elevator, we may call this concept of salvation 'elevator salvation'
Apparently those who preach and teach 'elevator salvation' have some ground in the Bible; actually they do not
They use all the verses which speak of dispensational punishment to support their belief that a saved person can be lost again
It is also wrong to teach that no matter what you do after you have been saved there will be no problem and you will continue to be saved
We need to be unloaded and drop the teaching of both these theological schools and see what the pure Word of God says concerning this matter
It is not we who selected Him but He who selected us , and His selection is not of our works but of Himself who calls
He has not only predestinated us but also called us , not according to our works but according to His own purpose
His selection and calling have nothing to do with our works; our works can never affect them, for they are unchangeable
God has not saved us according to our works, but according to His grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began
Our salvation is secured not by our works but by God's prevailing grace which comes out of His unchanging love
For the showing forth of His righteousness, God must justify us, and He has justified us who believe in the Lord Jesus
It has definitely been covenanted that He has written the law of life within us and that He will never remember our sins
The Lord Jesus said that His Father is greater than all, and that no one can snatch us out of the Father's hand
To say that once we are saved we can be lost again means that the eternal life which has been given to us would be called back
By offering Himself once to God He has perfected us forever , and His eternal redemption issues in our eternal salvation
In John 10:28 and 29 the Lord assures us that not only the Father's hand but also His hand will keep us from perishing
We are secured by two divine hands, the Father's hand of love and the Son's hand of grace, both of which are powerful to keep
If after receiving this knowledge, they still went back to offer the sacrifices for sin, they would have been sinning willfully
To suffer the second death is to perish in the lake of fire for eternity, that is, to suffer eternal perdition
They told their children that everything had been prepared for them and that it was their responsibility to do well in school
At the end of the year, the child who earned the A's received a reward, while the one who failed received some punishment
Verse 8 continues, 'But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are bastards and not sons'
For they indeed disciplined us for a few days as it seemed good to them, but He for our profit that we might partake of His holiness'
For this purpose, persecution was aroused to discipline them that they might be separated from the common to the holy
At the judgment seat of Christ all the believers will be judged concerning how they have lived and what they have done after they were saved
If these messages do not help you to go on, then they will be unprofitable as far as your welfare is concerned
For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more'
In the fourth warning in the book of Hebrews , two important things are mentioned-the worse punishment and the great reward
The writer of this epistle was not concerned with our salvation, for according to what he has written, it is eternally secure
The writer knew that our salvation was fully, thoroughly, and completely secure and that we have been saved forever
Many books deal with the matter of reward saying that if we follow the Lord faithfully and do His will we shall receive a crown as a reward
According to most of the teachings, it seems that God only rewards the faithful ones but does not punish the unfaithful
The clear word in His oracle says definitely that if we are faithful, He will reward us, but if we are not, He will punish us
If we do this, breaking the law of life, we shall suffer a worse punishment than those who broke the law of letters
When he wrote the book of 1 Corinthians, he was very much concerned that he might be a castaway in the heavenly race
Only in 2 Timothy 47 and 8 written shortly before his martyrdom did he have the assurance that the crown of righteousness was awaiting him
Salvation is by grace through faith, whereas the reward is according to the life and work we have after being saved
All the saints in the Lord's recovery must be clear about this, for it is a matter of God's economy, God's way of dealing with His children
Eternal salvation, as Ephesians 2:8 clearly reveals, is by grace through faith, having nothing to do with our works
The Lord Jesus said, 'I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand
We have two hands holding us, the Lord's hand of power and the Father's hand of love, out of which nothing can snatch us
Corinthians 3:15 reveals that a saved one may not receive a reward but 'suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire'
Verse 8 says, 'Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour'
Lest we think that since we shall still be saved there can be no problem, Paul said that we 'shall be saved, yet so as through fire'
If we are faithful in the kingdom exercise today, we shall be rewarded with the kingdom as an enjoyment in the coming age
In 2 Timothy 4:8, Paul says that a crown of righteousness, the symbol of this reward, not a crown of grace, was laid up for him
The Lord, the 'righteous judge,' will give him this reward of the kingdom according to His righteousness, not according to His grace
None of the unsaved will be judged at that time, for all of them will be judged at the white throne a thousand years later
At His coming back, the Lord 'will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts'
As we have seen in previous messages, this coming Sabbath rest will be Christ's joy and reign in the millennium
Based upon Christs eternal redemption eternal salvation has been given to us freely and eternally according to Gods eternal selection of us
Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work , whereas the kingdom reward is for our work after we are saved
We may not receive the kingdom reward even though we are saved, because we are void of the work which the Lord would approve
The promise in 9:15 is the promise of eternal inheritance based upon Christ's eternal redemption, not on our work
Even such a fallen, sinful brother would have his spirit saved, because the salvation of the spirit is eternal
At the time when we believed in the Lord Jesus and were saved, our spirit was regenerated with the Spirit of God
As to the saving or gaining of our soul, it depends upon how we deal with it in following the Lord after we are saved and regenerated
If we lose it now for the Lord's sake, we shall save it , and it shall be saved, or gained, at the Lord's coming back
According to the parable in Matthew 25, the Lord said to the faithful servants, 'Enter thou into the joy of thy lord'
In these last two messages we have seen clearly the matters of dispensational punishment, the kingdom reward, and the gaining of the soul
If in this age you gain your soul, being unwilling to pay the price to follow the Lord, you will lose your soul at the Lord's coming back
It means to be excluded from the enjoyment and reign of Christ when He rules over the nations in the millennial kingdom
Those who gain their soul in this age and lose it in the next will not be co-kings of Christ in the coming age of the kingdom
Receiving the reward is not simply doing good works, glorifying God, and receiving a prize at the Lord's coming back
Romans 829 says that we have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son that He should be the firstborn among many brothers
We see God's goal-that His many sons, who are Christ's many brothers, might be conformed to the image of His Firstborn Son
Immediately, the goal of the priesthood became a reward for one tribe, the tribe of Levi, which stood with God
If we cooperate with God, He will work within us day by day, and every day we shall enjoy Christ to the uttermost
If we have this enjoyment of Christ today, when He comes to reign, we shall enter into His reign as His co-kings and partners
Although they have been saved, they have no enjoyment of Christ, living each day in the same way as those who do not have Christ
Although they belong to Christ, having Him as their life and Savior, they do not give Him the opportunity to live within them
After being punished, he must still read, study, and finish all his lessons; otherwise, he would never graduate from school
If we are not faithful to God we shall miss His goal in the coming age and will suffer some punishment to discipline us that we may reach it
May we all follow Him to such a degree that we are ushered into God's goal and that His goal will be our reward
In the first ten chapters of Hebrews we have a clear, thorough, and complete comparison between God's economy and man's religion
After presenting such a contrast, the writer tells us how to take this open, freshly slain way-it is by the unique way of faith
Hebrews 10:39 says, 'But we are not of them who shrink back to ruin, but of them who have faith to the gaining of the soul'
We all must say, 'I am willing to pay any price that the law of life might have the opportunity to work Christ into every part of my being'
Shrinking back ruins the good material by soulish enjoyments, worldly entertainments, and religious activities
Those who lose their soul in the future are those who do not care for their future perfection, glorification, and gaining of their soul
If we are willing to pay the price to lose our soul today, in the future we shall gain our soul and be perfected and glorified
After presenting a thorough comparison of Judaism with God's economy, the writer charges the Hebrew believers to go on by faith
Suppose someone would offer you a document which said that a large amount of money had been deposited in your bank account
The power of the proper gospel preaching is that people are infused with faith to such an extent that they believe whatever we tell them
Whenever we minister God to people, we must be able to infuse them with faith; otherwise, whatever we minister to them will be in vain
We must come forward to the Holy of Holies and to God's new covenant dispensation in the full assurance of faith
To take God's new covenant way and to follow the Lord in this way causes us a lot of suffering in material things
Although certain things cannot be seen, heard, or touched, we nevertheless have within us the ability to substantiate them
Our Christ, who is in us, is 'the hope of glory' , which will issue in the redemption, the transfiguration of our body in glory
Our God is 'the God of hope' , and 'through the encouragement of the Scriptures we may have hope' all the time 'in God' and 'rejoice in it'
We need to contact God for His infusion of faith that we may substantiate all the things which He has promised as our hope
The proper faith is the divine element even God Himself infused into our being as the ability to substantiate the things which we do not see
According to typology, Abel's more excellent sacrifice was a type of Christ who is the real 'better sacrifices'
Verse 5 says, 'By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him
Verse 10 says that by faith Abraham 'waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Maker is God'
Sarah had become an old woman whose function had ceased; yet in the midst of her situation, she believed in God's word
If you read Isaac's history, you will see that he was not a smart man; he was quite common, and there was nothing special about him
When we are settled, we no longer need to keep a staff in our hand, for that is a sign of a sojourner, not of a dweller
Verse 22 says By faith Joseph when near his end remembered concerning the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave orders concerning his bones
Joseph remembered the coming exodus of the sons of Israel and charged them to bring his bones out of Egypt and into Canaan
The Greek word translated 'temporary' in verse 25 may also be rendered 'for awhile,' 'short-lived,' 'fleeting,' 'passing'
Moses refused this, choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to have the fleeting enjoyment of sin
The reproach falling on them was considered also as His reproach, and the reproaches of those who reproached God fell upon Him too
He was not allowed to enter into the rest of the good land because of his failure at Meribah , but he will be with Christ in the kingdom
The palace of Pharaoh, the royal sonship, the worldly enjoyment and attainment, and all the things in Egypt were there before him
Although at that time the reward was far away from him, he looked unto it and was encouraged by it to forsake everything in Egypt
Verse 27 says that by faith Moses 'left Egypt not fearing the wrath of the king, for he was steadfast as seeing the invisible One'
Verse 28 says By faith he instituted the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them
It also took faith for Moses to tell the people to prepare the lamb and to sprinkle the blood on the lintels and posts of the doors
Without seeing the Passover, which was to come, Moses substantiated it by faith and acted according to this substantiation
Even their crossing of the Jordan River is not accounted here, because that crossing was due to the delay caused by their unbelief
If they had had faith at Kadesh-barnea, they could have entered the good land thirty-eight years earlier than they did
Verse 35 says, 'Others were beaten to death, not accepting deliverance, in order that they might obtain a better resurrection'
Verse 40 says, 'God having in view something better concerning us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect'
All these better things are the fulfillment and reality of the things which the Old Testament saints had in types, figures, and shadows
Why should the Hebrew believers leave the real things of the new covenant and return to the shadows of the old covenant?
Both the participation in the kingdom for a thousand years and the sharing in the New Jerusalem for eternity are a corporate matter
For the obtaining and enjoying of the good things of God's promise, they need the New Testament believers to perfect them
In the past, many of us thought that it would have been wonderful to live during the time of the Old Testament
We are living in a better age and we have heard, experienced, and participated in better things than the things in the old covenant age
The believers in the realities of the new covenant are greater than the saints in the shadows of the old covenant
Since John the Baptist was greater than Abraham and we are greater than John, then we also are greater than Abraham
During this transitory period, John the Baptist came and saw the Christ, whom all the saints in the Old Testament time had been waiting for
As verse 39 indicates, the Old Testament saints did not obtain the promise because God had in view 'something better concerning us'
As long as it has not been reached, the time cannot come, and the foregoing overcomers will still need to wait for us
We are living in the consummating period of God's economy, and so many foregoing overcomers are expecting to see our completion
We are surely the most blessed people in the universe for we have the golden opportunity to share in the fulfillment of Gods eternal purpose
As we have seen, the saints of the old covenant were only the witnesses of faith, but Jesus is the Author and Perfecter of faith
The Greek word translated 'Author' may also be rendered 'Originator,' 'Inaugurator,' 'Leader,' 'Pioneer,' 'Forerunner'
We need Jesus as the Author of faith because, according to our natural man, we do not have any believing ability
When we look unto Jesus, He, as 'the life-giving Spirit' , transfuses us with Himself, with His believing element
If you read the four Gospels again, you will see that His life was a cutting life, a life that cut the way of faith
By looking unto Him continually, we shall have Him finish and complete the faith which we need for running the heavenly race
Being the Finisher and the Completer of faith, He will finish and complete what He has originated and inaugurated
If he is charged and charming, as he stands in front of the people, he will have the sense that something is being transfused into them
The gospel preacher may lack eloquence, but because he is so charming, others are charmed as they listen to him
We are charged with the divine element, and then, in the ministry, we radiate that divine element into others in a charming way
He transfuses us with Himself, working Himself into us, until He, the very Person, becomes the believing element in our being
If we give the law of life the opportunity to work continuously in our mind, emotion, and will, its working will produce great faith in us
The book of Hebrews is focused on the law of life, and faith is the firstfruit of the working of the law of life in our being
The arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle ultimately leads to the law of life-the expression and testimony of God
The experience of Christ which begins at the cross and consummates with the law of life issues in the testimony of God
As the law of life works within us to bring about the expression and testimony of God, the first issue of its working is our believing
According to life, Hebrews 11 is the issue of Hebrews 8, for the believing ability results from the working of the law of the divine life
When the law of life operates within us to make us the very reflection, expression, and testimony of God, we find it easy to believe
The Apostle Paul, who has run the race and won the prize, was nearly the only one who likened the Christian life to a race
In the book of Hebrews he charged the Hebrew believers to run the race, saying, 'run with endurance the race which is set before us'
The race is not even the losing of the soul, because that is the way to run the race; it is not the race itself
Before Christ was manifested, God used types to signify this matter of Christ as God's way, the most striking of which was the tabernacle
In His mercy, God came in to establish the way of redemption that the distracted man might be brought back to God's way
Although Abel was brought back to God's way, Cain was distracted by a further step of Satan, never returning to God's original way
Judaism, the Jewish religion, misused the tabernacle and everything revealed in the Old Testament to make a religion
The very religion which was constituted according to God's holy word eventually distracted God's people from God's way
The Lord Jesus went to the house of Simon the leper in Bethany, where He enjoyed fellowship with those brothers and sisters
When he realized that some of his countrymen, such as Peter, John, and Stephen, were not in this religion, he was stirred up to oppose them
By that time, the way had become a race, and Peter, John, Stephen, and all the other believers were running in it
Eventually he realized that he had to forget about being a Hebrew and not only walk on the way but run the race
If we run the race, taking no time to look around and keeping our eyes fixed on the goal, we shall not be distracted
Although Paul might never have staggered, as a typical Hebrew believer, he must have considered his background
If he had not been a typical Hebrew believer experiencing all these things, he could not have helped the staggering Hebrew Christians
As a result, he knew the cure for the staggering Hebrew Christians and was able to give them the right medicine
In the book of Hebrews, Paul gave the best medication to the crippled ones that they might be brought back to running the race
They were in danger of either being stranded or of shrinking back to Judaism and not coming forward to the Holy of Holies
They were in danger of turning from God's goal to something used by the enemy to distract God's people from His way
After eleven chapters in which he presented the Hebrew believers a clear view of the way, the writer seemed to say, 'Let us run the race
We must flee everything into the Holy of Holies where our Forerunner, Jesus Christ, has entered within the veil
To the staggering Hebrew believers, the thought of shrinking back and returning to Judaism was an entangling sin
In order to run the race of Christ, we must suffer the opposition with endurance, never growing weary or fainting in our souls
The Greek word translated 'looking away unto' means to look with undivided attention by turning away from every other object
The runners in a race, such as the hundred yard dash, turn away from everything else and look at the goal with undivided attention
In this book, he points us particularly to the Christ seated in heaven with so many aspects to care for us in every way
To enjoy the heavenly Christ we need to look away from all things on earth unto Him who is seated at the right hand of the throne of God
Verse 3 says, 'Consider Him Who has endured such contradiction from sinners against Himself, lest you grow weary, fainting in your souls'
Because Paul's background was exactly that of the Hebrew believers, he was qualified to be an example in running the race
In Philippians 3 we see that Paul was a typical Hebrew believer running the race away from the old Jewish religion
In Hebrews 12 Paul was warning the Hebrew brothers and encouraging them, giving them a great incentive to run the race
Although we may be in the shekinah glory in the Holy of Holies, we still need to experience the contents of the ark
To be holy means to reach the consummate point of the experience of Christ, that is, to experience the law of life
Nothing can make us more subjectively holy than the law of life, for it works God's holy nature, which is true holiness, into our being
Both the hidden manna and the budding rod are for our enjoyment and privilege, but the law of life is for God's working
If we would be holy to the uttermost, we must experience the law of life by which God works Himself into us as our real holiness
Hebrews 12:7, referring to the persecution of the Hebrew believers, says, 'It is for discipline that you are enduring'
From God's point of view, the persecution which the Hebrew believers suffered from Judaism was a discipline, a chastening
For this purpose, persecution was aroused to discipline them that they might be separated from the common to the holy
If we have never been permeated inwardly with God's holy nature, we can never have proper righteousness in our outward behavior
Holiness is entering into the Holy of Holies to reach the law of life, the working of which saturates us with God's holy nature
When we are saturated with God's nature, we spontaneously have the issue of righteousness, and this righteousness brings in genuine peace
As we have seen, peace is the fruit of righteousness, and holiness is the inward nature, while righteousness is the outward behavior
Based upon the proper doctrines which it has shown us, it charges us to run the race and make straight paths for our feet
Although they know that the way of the church life in the Lord's recovery is the right way, they do not dare to pay the full price
Some saints today who have seen the way of the church are afraid of being criticized and say Let us not go to the extreme and cause trouble
Some have said, 'Yes, we know that we are the church, but we should not say this because others will be offended
Praise the Lord that in the Lord's recovery in the United States today there is a highway from Los Angeles to New York
The implication here is that while we are pursuing peace with all men, we must also pay attention to the matter of holiness before God
Praise the Lord that in His recovery today, the more we come into the Holy of Holies, the more we are at peace
The staggering Hebrew Christians tried to keep the peace with their opposers, but eventually they lost their holiness
The writer tried his best to bring them back to the proper peace, the peace which is the fruit of righteousness and true holiness
The way in 10:20 is the way to enter into the Holy of Holies, and the race in 12:1 is for reaching the goal and obtaining the reward
We must make straight paths that their ankles would not be put out of joint, that is, be dislocated or wrenched, but rather be healed
Although at the beginning we may be only a short way off from the Holy of Holies, eventually we find that we are a great distance away
The more we run, the larger the Holy of Holies becomes, expanding from the tabernacle, to the temple, and ultimately to the New Jerusalem
For the young people, the Holy of Holies in which they are running may be just ten cubits long, wide, and high
John 1:17 says that grace came through Jesus Christ, and John 1:16 says, 'Of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace'
It is not only the work the Lord does for us; it is the Triune God Himself dispensed into our being and experienced as our enjoyment
According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, grace is nothing less than God in Christ dispensed into our being for our enjoyment
According to the Greek, to be severed from Christ means to be cut off from Him like a branch is cut off from a tree
A number of times when we were cut off from the fellowship with the living Christ, we also had the sense that we were severed from grace
At the altar, we enjoy Christ as our sacrifices, and at the laver we enjoy Him as the life-giving Spirit who washes us
At the ark of testimony within the Holy of Holies, we enjoy Christ as the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the law of life
If you do, you will be giving up the way to enjoy Christ as your grace, and you will fall away from the grace of God'
In these verses we see three causes of falling away from the grace of God: the bitter root, the fornicator, and the profane person
The Judaizers attempted to convince the Hebrew believers that the new covenant way was wrong and that the old covenant way was right
The profane person is one who loves the world and the worldly things, and who is captured by the entertainment of physical things
Esau's birthright as the firstborn son of Isaac was the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship
If we do not enjoy Christ today as our good land, how can we enter into His rest in the kingdom and inherit the earth with Him?
Expressing God in His image is the priesthood, and ruling over all created things with God's dominion and authority is the kingship
God gave the earth to man that he might take possession of it and replenish it through the spreading of God's expression and dominion
In Genesis 1 we see the priesthood, the kingship, and the land, the three things assigned by God to man as his destiny
By reading the Old Testament, we see that God's intention with the children of Israel was the same as with mankind originally
God intended to give the children of Israel the priesthood that they might express Him and His authority that they might represent Him
Although Reuben, the first son of Jacob, should have had the birthright, he lost it due to his fall and the defilement of his fleshly lust
If we fail to do these three things today, how shall we be able to do them during the coming age of the kingdom?
We must practice the priesthood and the kingship and we must enjoy and take full possession of our good land today
In this message we come to a very exciting subject-the contrast between the sight of the old covenant and the scene of the new covenant
Sarah, Abraham's wife, symbolizes grace in resurrection, and Hagar, the concubine, symbolizes the law related to the flesh
Darkness was not only an objective condition for those in the old covenant; it had become the gloom in which they dwelt
If the Hebrew brothers had returned to the old covenant where the darkness was, that darkness would have brought them into gloom
Religion is filled with warnings, such as, 'Don't do this or you will go to hell,' or, 'Be careful or you will lose your salvation'
Religion always says, 'Be careful-don't do that,' for in religion there are always many more 'don'ts' than 'do's'
Because all the items in the sight of the old covenant were of the old dispensation they were temporal, not permanent
Just as the old creation will one day pass away, so all the items of the old covenant, belonging to the old creation, have been terminated
The Apostle Paul used the background of the Olympic games to show us that in this universe a game is in progress
In Luke 15:7 and 10, the Lord Jesus said, 'There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth'
It is very significant that Paul put the myriads of angels together with the church of the firstborn ones who are enrolled in the heavens
Peter 1:12, speaking of things which 'the angels desire to look into,' indicates that the angels are eager to know this gospel game
If there were no games in the United States, many Americans would be waiting, wondering when there would be a game
As the third pair in the scene of the new covenant, we have God, the Judge of all , and the spirits of just men who have been made perfect
The fourth pair is Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant and the blood of sprinkling which speaks better than that of Abel
In this pair, we have not only the Mediator, the Redeemer, of the new covenant, but also the blood of the new covenant
Because the eight items of the new covenant are on the side of resurrection, all of them are eternal, existing forever
The people under the old covenant came to the side of the law, whereas we Christians under the new covenant come to the side of grace
They celebrate the human heirs of salvation participating in the blessings of the new covenant as the church of the firstborn ones
What a contrast to the sight on the side of the law, where no God, no Savior, and even no angels are mentioned!
After looking at such a contrast, who would be so foolish to leave the side of grace and turn to the side of the law?
Because we have such a doctrinal mind, we may argue with this statement, saying, 'What about the kingdom of heaven?
Hebrews 1:11, speaking of the heavens and the earth says, 'They shall perish, but You remain; and they all shall become old as a garment'
These verses indicate that the stone, which is Christ, will eventually become a great mountain filling the whole earth
Colossians 1:13 says, 'Who hath delivered us from the authority of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the son of his love'
The reality of the kingdom, the kingdom in its reality, is an exercise and discipline for us in the church today
We realize that we must uplift the standard of the church life through the discipline and exercise of the reality of the kingdom
If we do not accept the Spirit's exercise and God's discipline today, we shall miss the coming kingdom in its manifestation as a reward
To miss the coming kingdom and to lose our birthright in the coming age does not mean that we shall perish but that we shall lose the reward
Whether or not we receive the reward and the birthright in the manifestation of the kingdom depends upon our exercise today
As we have seen, the loss of the reward in the coming kingdom, the forfeiture of our birthright, does not mean that we shall perish
All the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 are concluded with the same concept-the reward of the kingdom or the loss of it
The complete revelation of the Bible refers these negative points to the suffering of the loss of the kingdom reward
All the warnings in Hebrews do not refer to the loss of eternal salvation, but to the loss of the kingdom reward
Since some Christian teachers do not see the matter of the kingdom reward, they must say that the slothful servant is a false servant
Since not all Christians are willing to cooperate with God in this matter, He, in His wisdom, has decided to make the birthright a reward
If we take grace, enter into the Holy of Holies, and cooperate with God, we shall certainly live out the birthright
To meet the demands of His holiness we need to be sanctified, to be made holy, by the heavenly, present, and living Christ
Romans stresses the matter of justification for Gods righteousness whereas Hebrews emphasizes the matter of sanctification for Gods holiness
God has revealed that if we do not cooperate with Him in His administrative economy but rather break His government, He will punish us
Although Romans 8:2 does mention the law of the Spirit of life, Hebrews covers the law of life much more thoroughly than Romans does
As we have seen, the law of life is neither in the outer court nor in the Holy Place; it is in the ark of testimony in the Holy of Holies
When the believers assembled themselves together in ancient times, that assembly was the practical and actual church
As we have seen, in 12:18-24, we have a contrast between the sight of the old covenant and the scene of the new covenant
In the scene of the new covenant we see Mount Zion Gods holy city the myriads of celebrating angels and the church of the firstborn ones
Verse 2 says, 'Do not be forgetful of hospitality, for through this some have entertained angels without knowing it'
No one can estimate how much hospitality has built up the Lord's testimony since the beginning of the Lord's recovery in this country
In Romans 12:13 we are told to pursue hospitality, and in 1 Timothy 3:2, Titus 1:8, and 1 Peter 4:9 we are admonished to be hospitable
Verse 3 says, 'Remember the prisoners as bound with them, and those who are ill-treated as being yourselves also in the body'
Verse 4 says, 'Let marriage be held in honor among all, and the bed undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge'
Whether a church is sound and healthy or loses its element and essence is very much dependent upon the marriage life
We must possess our body, our vessel, in sanctification and honor , that 'no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter'
We should always be satisfied with our circumstances that we may not be distracted from the church life by mammon
Since we have the Lord as our helper, we should be content and at peace that we may be fully kept in the enjoyment of the church life
We may have the peace to sacrifice everything for the Lord and for the church life, not worrying about our living
The church members will not only receive the word they minister, but also imitate their faith expressed in their manner of life
Verse 16 says, 'Do not be forgetful doing good and sharing with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased'
If we would maintain a good order in the house of God, we must have the leading ones, and all the saints must obey them and submit to them
These young men, all of whom were in their early twenties, were just boy elders, having been established by some self-appointed king
Verses 18 and 19 say, 'Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring in all things to conduct ourselves rightly
As we consider these ten virtues, we see that they are all necessary for the church life and should be practiced among us
The altar, laver, incense altar, and ark form a line, and the showbread table and the lampstand form an intersecting line
He comes to the altar where he kneels down, makes confession, and takes Christ as his substitute, Redeemer, and Savior
Once we are in the Holy Place, we make a right turn to the showbread table where we enjoy Christ as the bread of life
Now, after coming into the church, we have been helped to eat Christ, to feed on Him, and even to masticate Him
After feeding on Christ at the showbread table, we must make an about-face and take a straight path to the lampstand
At the lampstand we are enlightened by the light of life , that is, by the light which comes from feeding on Christ
When we begin at the altar in the outer court, we are filled with many negative things, such as sin, the world, the flesh, lusts, and Satan
What remains after making all these turns is a resurrected, uplifted humanity which is suitable to be mingled with divinity
At the time of their festivals, all the Israelites were excited, much more excited than Americans and Europeans are at Christmas time
The Judaizers might have come to the Hebrew believers, saying, 'In a few days the feast of tabernacles will begin
The writer seemed to be telling the Hebrew believers, 'Brothers, God sent His messengers to preach to you the word of Christ
If you accepted Him as the Christ in the past, you should not change your concept now due to the strange teachings about eating
Because of the dissension and division caused by strange teachings, the apostle charged people 'not to teach differently'
The writer warned the Hebrew believers not to let the teachings carry them away from the church life under the new covenant
The teachings about Christmas trees, Santa Claus, and stockings are some of today's various and strange teachings
Others have said, 'We know that the Lord's recovery is the way, but because our children cannot give up Christmas, we cannot take this way'
The writer of this book argues that in the sin offering, the basic offering for their yearly atonement , there was nothing for anyone to eat
Since our problem with God is basically a problem of sin, the sin offering is the basic and most crucial of all the offerings
Several times in this book we are told that Christ offered Himself , but each time we see that Christ offered Himself as the sin offering
Verse 12 says, 'Wherefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate'
Christ's body suffered the death of the cross outside the gate, and His blood was brought into the Holy of Holies for our sanctification
By participating in Him in this way, we shall be enabled to follow Him outside the camp by the sanctifying pathway of the cross
Those who have forsaken the church meetings and have returned to the religious practices in Christianity have given up their birthright
Those who have done this do not care for Christ and the church; they only care for today's religious attractions
Since they have sold their birthright, they can neither enjoy Christ nor exercise the priesthood and the kingship
If we would have the exercise of our birthright which will issue in receiving the reward in the kingdom, we must remain in the church
Our heart must be confirmed by grace, not by any religious food, that is, not by any religious attractions, positions, titles, and practices
Many things are waiting for an opportunity to distract us from the paths of this race, that is, from the enjoyment of grace
As the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle reveals, every path of this race is an aspect of the enjoyment of Christ
If we would experience Christ in this aspect we must take the way of the cross suffering persecution rejection and opposition from religion
We do not have a permanent city, any organized realm, but we seek the coming one, God's Holy City, the New Jerusalem
By using the pronoun we in these verses the writer was considering himself and his readers as real rivercrossing Hebrews like the patriarchs
Verse 15 says, 'Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name'
He as the life-giving Spirit praises the Father in our spirit, and we, by our spirit, also praise the Father in His Spirit
In the Holy of Holies, the unique place, there is one unique thing-the ark of testimony, which is the full symbol of Christ
In the book of Hebrews, both the gate and the camp signify the Jewish religion with its two aspects, the earthly and the human
Inside the camp, that is, in the organization of religion, there are no angels, church, Savior, saved ones, Christ, or sprinkled blood
The book of Hebrews instructs and charges us to come forward to the Holy of Holies and to enter within the veil
Although the Lord Jesus firstly went outside the gate and then entered within the veil, it is exactly the opposite with us
After showing us the heavenly Christ within the veil, the book of Hebrews encourages us to enter within the veil
We must go outside the camp, wherein is the worship of the idol, that we may enjoy the Lord's presence and hear His speaking
The religion either Judaism Catholicism or Protestantism which has rejected the Lord is a camp a human organization given up by the Lord
The great Babylon mentioned in Revelation 17 is even a worldly city, an earthly realm, from which the Lord's people must come out
Rather, the serpent spoke to her in a religious way, saying, 'Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden'?
Because we were born and raised in religion, religion is not only in our concept, but also in our being, in our blood
The more we are in our spirit enjoying the heavenly Christ, the more we shall be outside religion following the suffering Jesus
To be in our spirit to enjoy the glorified Christ enables us to come outside religion to follow the rejected Jesus
The more we contact the heavenly Christ in His glory in our spirit the more we shall go to the lowly Jesus in His suffering outside religion
The Holy of Holies, the pathway of the cross , and the kingdom are three crucial matters set forth in this book
The Holy of Holies enables us to take the pathway of the cross, and the pathway of the cross ushers us into the kingdom in its manifestation
The writer seemed to be telling the Hebrew believers, 'Brothers, get out of your camping mind and get into your spirit'
Do not think they need some religious ones to tell them to behave themselves, to learn patience, and to camp religiously
If we experience Christ in such an inner way, we shall see how much of the religious camping element is still in our blood
We are for anything that is for God's economy, for the dispensing of the Triune God into us for the building up of the Body of Christ
By experiencing these things, we are infused, empowered, strengthened, and enabled to go outside of every camp
My real burden in all these messages on Hebrews is that we may all enter within the veil and go outside the camp
Within the veil we behold the glorified Christ that we may be attracted to follow the suffering Jesus outside the camp
We also participate in the ministry of the heavenly Christ that we may be equipped to minister Him to the thirsty spirits outside the camp
Only here, with the word 'doing in us that which is well-pleasing in His sight,' does this book imply the indwelling of Christ
It is through the indwelling Christ whom we enjoy within the veil in our spirit that God works in us that we may do His will
When God brought in redemption in Exodus 12, the eating was changed to include more than just the one item, the tree of life
In the first stage, eating was only for man's life supply, but in the second stage, eating was for both redemption and the life supply
Since there certainly was no blood in the manna, the eating of manna was unrelated to redemption; it was altogether for the life supply
The Lord said, 'Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves'
As we have pointed out, the entire book of Hebrews is focused on Christ as the heavenly Minister with His kingly and divine priesthood
We have seen that the book of Hebrews calls us to come forward to the Holy of Holies, to the throne of grace, and to God
In the Holy of Holies we are not gathered around the cross for redemption; we are meeting around the throne of grace for the life supply
After passing through the second veil, we enter into the inner chamber of the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies
Because these items are all in the ark in the Holy of Holies, we may say that they are the kernels within the kernel
In color, shape, appearance, taste, and in every other aspect it was absolutely different from anything they had ever seen before
Whenever we touch Christ as our life supply, we have the deep sense that heaven has come to us in a soft, watering manner
As we enjoy touching Christ as our manna, we have the sense that heaven has come down to visit, water, and refresh us
Although some hymns have been written to praise Christ for His greatness, we also need to praise Him for His smallness
While we are being watered and refreshed, we also sense that the negative things within us, such as our negative attitudes, are being killed
The more we take in Christ as our life supply, the more our color will be reduced and the whiter we shall become
As our manna, Christ has this element of the mingling of the animal life with the vegetable life which becomes our sweet nourishment
According to the original Hebrew, Numbers 11:7 says, 'The manna was as coriander seed, and the eye thereof as the eye of bdellium'
If you are surrounded by several brothers who love the Lord and feed on Him, you will sense that everything is transparent
It can he eaten as bread, cake, and wafers, it has the taste of honey and fresh oil, and its appearance is like an eyeball
Although we might have read Exodus 16 and Numbers 11 many times, we probably have never noticed all these aspects of the manna
Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations'
The open manna, the people's portion, came from God, and the hidden manna, God's portion, was offered back to God
The children of Israel were required to take the top tenth, the choicest portion of their produce in the good land, and offer it to God
After this had been offered to God, it was given to the serving ones, to the priests and Levites who served the tabernacle
When the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, God gave them manna from heaven as a gift every day
The open manna was the people's portion, and this offered, hidden manna in the pot before God's testimony was God's portion
The principle was the same with offering the produce after the children of Israel had entered into the good land
Once they were in the land, God no longer sent manna from heaven, for the good land provided all that was needed for their living
The children of Israel did so, giving this one tenth to the priests and the Levites who served in and around the tabernacle
God told the priests and the Levites to take one tenth of what they received from the people and offer it to God
While we are enjoying Christ as our manna, we must take the best portion and offer it to God, offering Christ to God
Do not think that you will suddenly enjoy Christ as your hidden manna if you have never enjoyed Him as your open manna
Applying this to our situation today, we see that outside the church life it is impossible to enjoy the hidden manna
As many of us can testify, before we joined a service group, we were not even in the outer court; we were on the street
When we are in the place where we touch the golden pot, we are absolutely outside the world, our self, and our natural man
After joining a service group, you were ushered into more of the church life and you began to experience something finer
On some occasions, you were so close to God that you were beyond the world, your self, and even your natural being
Because so few Christians experience the hidden manna, their rod does not bud, and we very rarely find one who lives by the law of life
They do not understand the record in the Bible concerning the hidden manna the budding rod and the law of life because they lack experience
When we partake of the hidden manna, we are not experiencing a Christ on the altar, nor are we partaking of a Christ on the showbread table
Peter 1:4 says, 'Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature'
In the golden pot, that is, in the divine nature, there is the hidden manna as the special portion for our enjoyment
It is here that we enjoy the hidden Christ, the Christ who is hid in God with us and the Christ with whom we are hid in God
The golden pot is in the ark, and the ark is in the Holy of Holies, and the Holy of Holies is joined to our spirit
If we are troubled in this way, we are far off from our spirit, and thus it will be difficult for us to be in the Holy of Holies
When we are beyond all situations, good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant, then we are in our spirit touching the ark and the golden pot
If anyone wanted to partake of spiritual food, the heavenly manna, he had to leave Egypt and go into the wilderness
Even if an Israelite was in the wilderness, he still had to be near the camp of the children of Israel in order to partake of the manna
By this we see that the distance between us and the Lord is a very important matter in the enjoyment of spiritual food
After the children of Israel had enjoyed the manna, God commanded the Israelites to present an omer of manna to Him
Because you are far off from the innermost chamber of the tabernacle, you do not have the right to enjoy the hidden manna
Although you may eventually come into the outer court, you still cannot enter into the Holy Place, much less into the Holy of Holies
If you are a priest, you may be in the Holy Place and be closer to God than the Levites who are serving in the outer court
According to Numbers 18:26-28, after the priests and the Levites received the tithe, they offered one tenth of the tenth to the Lord
Since he was the one closest to God, he had the right to enjoy the topmost portion of the produce of the good land
If we overcome being worldly, we shall be in the presence of God and have the privilege of eating the hidden manna
If you read history and the biographies of the saints, you will see that many of them enjoyed Christ as the open manna
In the little booklet Ministry to the House or to the Lord Brother Nee encourages us to minister to God not to something good other than God
There is a special portion of Christ kept in the presence of God for the dear ones who overcome the situation of the church in Pergamos
It is that portion of Christ which we enjoy in the presence of God when there is no distance between us and Him
At other times, when there is no distance between us and the Lord, we enjoy Christ in the most intimate and hidden way
When we forsook that work, even at the cost of our lives, we were brought directly into the presence of the Lord
We also know it by the deep inner sense that we are enjoying the hidden Christ as the top portion of the produce of the good land
Many Christians can understand something of the manna, for they know that it is a heavenly food signifying Christ as the bread of life
After the Israelites had received the law at Mount Sinai, the Lord told them to put the two tables of the law into the ark
Out of that rebellion came the budding rod, which was put before the testimony, which was in the ark, as a sign
If we try to understand these three items by our mentality and for the purpose of acquiring knowledge, we shall not succeed
The children of Israel were at least a few million in number, for the male warriors alone numbered more than six hundred thousand
Since the number of the Israelites was so great, there was certainly the need, as there is today, for the building up of God's people
In order for God's people to express God and to represent Him, there must be both the priesthood and the kingship
In the church today there is still the need of the priesthood to express God and the kingship to represent God
Moses, representing the kingship, and Aaron, representing the priesthood, were put together for God's leadership
God did not take Moses and put him into the leadership immediately after he had completed his education in Pharaoh's palace
Since he did not have a worldly education God raised up the circumstances to enable him to receive the highest education in Pharaohs palace
The children of Israel were delivered out of the land of Egypt and they should have entered into the land of milk and honey
Eventually, in Numbers 16, the rebels blamed Moses and Aaron, and not their own unbelief, for their not entering into the good land
In Numbers 17 God seemed to be saying to Moses, 'Those sons of rebellion were fighting with you over the leadership
A staff is for helping and supporting those who are weak and crippled and who have difficulty standing or walking
Only with the proper leadership among God's people is there a rod budding with resurrection life and yielding fruit to nourish others
The leadership among Gods children must be Christ Himself as the resurrection life which buds blossoms and bears almonds to feed Gods people
When the fifth sister hears that her name is mentioned last, she may be so bothered that she will be unable to pray for a week
A brother who is close to eighty years of age may have no ambition, but a young man may desire to be today's Apostle Paul
When Moses was forty, he was ambitious to take the lead to rescue God's people from the tyranny of the Egyptian king
Today, as those who are in the church loving the Lord, you are ambitious and expect that one day you will be qualified for the leadership
Not only is there within us the rebellion against other leaders, but many times our soul rebels against our spirit
We must look at them as a collective person, a corporate person, who includes Moses, Aaron, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram
There is also another element within you- the regenerated element, the life element which is Christ Himself as the resurrection life
When you get into the ark in the Holy of Holies and touch Christ as the resurrection life, this element will become your leadership
As long as these two things, the ambition and the rebellion, are fighting within us, the building can never go on
The element of Christ within us must be vindicated, strengthened, enriched, uplifted, and made to bud, blossom, and yield almonds
As we walk the path from the altar to the budding rod, the rebellion must be eliminated and the positive ambition must be released
God's building depends upon this budding rod, which can only be experienced within the ark in the Holy of Holies
For this, we must come forward to enter the Holy of Holies and enjoy the very Christ who is the unique ark of God's testimony
Have you ever heard a message on the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the two tables of the law contained in the ark?
In the previous message we pointed out that for the fulfillment of His purpose God had to have a people as a corporate unit
Even as they were wandering in the wilderness, they were a corporate people, not a group of individuals with everyone taking his own way
There was just one tabernacle which, as God's unique dwelling place, was the center for the building up of God's people
Korah who belonged to the tribe of Levi the same tribe to which Moses and Aaron belonged considered himself to be equal to Moses and Aaron
Dathan and Abiram probably thought that because their tribe was the first, they also should be among the leaders
When many Christians read Hebrews 9 they pay no attention to the budding rod because among them there is not the building up of Gods people
Because most Christians do not pay attention to this matter of the building, they are not interested in the budding rod
Many today talk about spirituality, gifts, behavior, and speaking in tongues, but who is concerned about the building up of God's people?
If we are not for this, we have neither the standing nor the qualifications to understand the significance of the budding rod
If you enter into the Holy of Holies and experience the ark, you will discover that in the ark is a basic item-the budding rod
If you are seeking the Lord, you must realize that God's goal is to bring you to the budding rod within the ark in the Holy of Holies
When he heard that he had been put on that service group, he wondered whether his position in that group would be the first or last
The sign at the altar is the judgment of the natural element , and the sign in the ark is the resurrection of the resurrected life
In Numbers 17 God told Moses to bring twelve dead rods, one for each of the twelve tribes, and to place them in His presence for a night
Whenever we come into the tabernacle, we must firstly come to the altar and see there a sign of God's judgment upon our natural element
Although you may love the Lord and care for His testimony, within you there are the elements of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram
The more you experience this, the brighter will shine the brass on the altar as a reminder that your natural man must be judged
If you bring a case to the natural brother, the issue will always be death, for he is a dead rod and can do nothing but kill
It is not a matter of competition; it is a matter of being judged and of having the self, the natural life, and the natural element burned
I'm filled with Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and with so many natural things that must be judged on the brass altar'
Whoever is willing to be judged will immediately be brought into the Holy of Holies and have the budding rod, the resurrection life
Of budding, you die; instead of blossoming, you kill others; and instead of bearing fruit, you deaden everyone who contacts you
We all need to exercise our spirit to contact the hidden Christ and to enjoy the topmost portion of the Christ hidden in the divine nature
The authority among God's people today is neither capability nor position; it is the budding, the blossoming, and the fruit-bearing
We should only care for the enjoyment of the top portion of the hidden Christ, that we might be able to bud even during the dark night
The Old Testament frequently speaks of the tables of the testimony , and the New Testament mentions the tables of the covenant
It is quite easy to understand why the law was called the tables of the covenant because in the Old Testament the law was the old covenant
Whatever was placed in front of the testimony was before God , for the testimony could not be separated from Him
When something was before the testimony, it was before God, and when it was before God, it was before the testimony
We have seen that the ark is called the ark of the testimony and that the tabernacle is called the tabernacle of the testimony
God's intention has been, still is, and for eternity will be the same-to work Himself into man that He may be expressed and have a testimony
God gave man the law because man did not know that, as a fallen being, he could neither satisfy God nor express Him
In Christianity, when many young people are examined for membership in the so-called churches, they must recite the ten commandments
Although you may be able to recite the commandments, perhaps you have never heard that the testimony in Psalm 119 is the law
They will require their children to arise early in the morning, to wash themselves, and then to clean their rooms
On the side of the law-maker, the law is a testimony; on the side of the law-keeper, the law is a commandment or regulation
In the Old Testament the law was God's testimony, but today Jesus Christ is His living, full, and adequate testimony
It is not sufficient to say that it is only in the Holy of Holies, for it is in the ark, that is, within the fourth layer
We have seen that the outer court is our body, that the Holy Place is our soul, and that the Holy of Holies is our spirit
It would have been a mistake for God to put the law in the altar, because His intention was not that man should keep the law
One day the real law, the living law, Christ, the reality of God's testimony, came, and we received Him into us
God's intention is to put the law into our innermost part and to have us submit ourselves to it, not to try to keep it
If you simply submit to Christ, He will live Himself out of you, and you will become the expression and testimony of God
We should not stay at the altar, nor linger at the laver, nor even remain in the Holy Place eating the superficial food
If we would thoroughly understand and apprehend the law of life, we must understand the basic concept of the divine revelation in the Bible
The basic and central concept in the Bible is that God intends to work Himself into us in order to make us His living expression
God desires to work Himself into His chosen people that they may be born of Him and have Him as their life and thus become His expression
Although this basic concept is found throughout the Bible, it has nearly been lost by fundamental Christianity
Eventually, this life will transform us and conform us to His very image, making us His living expression in the universe
Although this basic concept has nearly been lost, we thank God that now, in these last days, He has opened up to us this matter in His Word
God is now working Himself into us that we may have His life, that we may be one with Him, and that He may be one with us
Before Jesus Christ resurrected from the dead, God had only one Son, the One whom the Bible calls the Only Begotten Son
After His resurrection He was no longer the unique Only Begotten Son of God for in resurrection He became the Firstborn among many brothers
Hebrews 2:10 says that God is leading many sons into glory, and Romans 8:29 says that Christ is the Firstborn among many brothers
Deep in his heart, this man feels that only two of his sons are sons in life, sons in reality, while the other ten are merely sons in term
The Bible reveals that the Only Begotten Son of God has become the Firstborn among many sons, proving that God has just one kind of son
In saying that God has only one kind of son, are we saying that we, the many sons, are exactly the same as Jesus Christ?
Although in our spirit we are the same as the Son of God, in our mind, emotion, and will we are not yet the same as He
Perhaps even today you were thinking about a certain brother, saying to yourself, 'I don't like Brother So-and-So
After coming into us, He has been imprisoned within us, for He does not have the freedom to spread out from our spirit
The ministers and teachers in Christianity make molds, put them on people, and charge them to live in a certain way
If you would attempt to teach a peach tree to bring forth peaches, the tree would say, 'No one is as stupid as you are
No one instructs an apple tree to bring forth apples, because producing apples is the function of the life of an apple tree
When the demons met the Lord Jesus, they addressed Him as the Son of God , but He commanded them not to say this
When the Devil tempted the Lord in the wilderness, he said, 'If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread'
The Lord Jesus replied, 'It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God'
In ancient times there were the ancient modernists, called the Sadducees, who believed neither in angels, nor in demons, nor in resurrection
The Sadducees, along with the Pharisees, thought of the Lord Jesus simply as a Jew whose parents were Mary and Joseph
Once the demons admit that Jesus is the Son of Man they are destroyed, and once a man confesses that Jesus is the Son of God he is saved
If He had not become a man but had forever remained only as the Son of God with divinity, how could we have been saved?
John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh, and 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit
Our Savior today is not the same as He was before the incarnation, nor the same as He was when He was on earth
Within this life-giving Spirit there is the powerful, indestructible divinity, and there is also the proper, uplifted humanity
Both this wonderful divinity and this uplifted humanity are now in the Spirit, just like both the tea and the milk are in the water
Through His death, the old creation was terminated, the problem of sin was solved, and all the enemies and adversaries of God were destroyed
If we agree and cooperate with this wonderful One, opening up to Him, He will spread outward into our soul from our spirit
It is not a matter of imitating Jesus; it is a matter of being saturated with the sonship, just as water is saturated with tea
In Hebrews we are told that, after His first coming, Christ eventually became, through resurrection, the Firstborn Son
Before His incarnation He was the Only Begotten Son of God, but through resurrection He was born the Firstborn Son of God
They have more or less neglected the law of life and the conformation to the image of the Firstborn Son of God
Conformation is necessary for the completion of the sonship, for the completion of the many brothers of the Firstborn
Verse 14 says For as many as are led by the Spirit of God these are sons of God and verse 15 says that we have received a spirit of sonship
We know that we have received a spirit of sonship because the 'Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God'
Bad we may be or however defeated we are in our Christian life, we still have the witness in our spirit that we are sons of God
Romans 8 mentions the Spirit of life in verse 2, sonship in verses 14 through 16, and conformation in verse 29
Many times when you went shopping in a department store, you sensed that your mind was not on your spirit, but you still bought something
The mind of a fallen person is the representative of his whole being, for such a person does everything according to his mind
The Bible reveals that God's eternal intention is to have many sons and to make all these sons the same as He is
Since God is divine and we are human, how can we become God's divine sons, becoming the same as He is in both life and nature?
Although He became a man, He was still the very God, for He did not put off His divinity to become a mere human being
Having become a man in the flesh with human nature, Christ was crucified on the cross, was buried, and was resurrected
When the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you'
The Lord was not only the Spirit; He was the wonderful One with a body of flesh and bones in which could be seen the prints of the nails
John 1:14 says, 'The Word became flesh,' and 1 Corinthians 15:45 says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
As the Son of God, He became a man, and after becoming a man, He became the life-giving Spirit consisting of divinity and humanity
As the wonderful life-giving Spirit, He is now working all that He is into our being, transforming our being into His
Since we have the law of life and the anointing working and moving within us, we do not need the outward teachings of man
In so-called Pentecostal Christianity, people stress the exercise of the gifts, especially speaking in tongues
If they come to a meeting where there is no tongue speaking or manifestation of the so-called gifts, they are unhappy
On the one hand, fundamental Christianity stresses the teachings; on the other hand, Pentecostal Christianity stresses tongues
Even when the tongues are false, they still enjoy them, and even if their prophecies are not fulfilled, they are still addicted to them
Although that prophecy was not fulfilled, so many of the Pentecostalists are still addicted to their prophecies
As long as the little baby is living, he does not need anyone to teach him about what is sweet and what is bitter
The baby's reaction to sweet and bitter substances is not a matter of knowledge; it is a matter of the taste of nature
Before we were saved, we all did things which were not good, things such as gambling, drinking, smoking, dancing, and going to movies
From the very moment we were saved, we have had something within us which troubles us and disagrees with our doing certain things
After you were saved, especially after coming into the church life, you began to be troubled by the living Person of Christ
The very Christ who is now indwelling our spirit is the ointment composed of the Spirit of God and other elements
Whenever the Lord Jesus teaches us from within, His teaching is that of His anointing which gives us this comfortable, soothing sense
When the sisters are in a department store, many times their inner taste forbids them to purchase a particular item
If you try to suppress this function, it will spring up all the more, for the more it is suppressed, the higher it rises
If we take a step which He does not want to take, the anointing will stop, and the soothing, comforting sense will diminish
You might have spoken half a sentence, but, sensing that the anointing has ceased, you should not speak the remainder of that sentence
We have the spreading of the indwelling Christ into every part of our being and we undergo the process of God's transformation
What is being wrought into us is not only the Savior or the divine life, but also the prototype of the sonship, the Firstborn Son of God
As we have pointed out, there is a great difference between the Only Begotten Son of God and the Firstborn Son of God
With the Firstborn Son, on the contrary, there are both divinity and humanity because He is not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man
Between regeneration and glorification there is the process of sanctification, transformation, and conformation
According to the pure word of the Bible, the meaning of sanctification is to be saturated with the element of the prototype
The more we are saturated by the element of the Firstborn Son as the prototype, the more we are separated unto God from the world
Whether you are good or bad, right or wrong, moral or immoral, ethical or unethical, 'spiritual' or unspiritual, your being is still dark
Because you are so dark and non-transparent, you need to be sanctified by having the wonderful element of the prototype saturate your being
The more we are saturated with the element of Christ the more we are sanctified and the more we are sanctified the more we are transformed
By the Lord's mercy, we are in the proper church life being sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God's Firstborn Son
It can only be produced by the indwelling prototype, the real and living Firstborn Son of God, who automatically works in us
In ancient times, God called His people, the children of Israel, out from among the Gentiles and gave them the law
As the living God, He is the highest Person, having the full right to tell us one thing today and another thing tomorrow
Tonight the anointing may not allow you to go to the department store, but tomorrow the anointing may encourage you to go
While the law of life will never allow you to buy a fancy lamp, the anointing may or may not allow you to go to the department store
When they go to bed at night, they must even place their shoes in a certain direction according to a verse in the Old Testament
These orthodox Jews think that they are the people of God and that God is their God according to their religion
Gradually, however, our living according to the law of life developed into a habit, and the habit became a regulation
If we do this, we shall enjoy God and become His people, and God will become so living, rich, and enjoyable to us
We must also read Romans 8:16 and 17: 'The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God
If children, heirs also; heirs of God and joint-heirs of Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him'
He desires to saturate us until we are sanctified transformed and conformed to His image and reach the perfection and completion of sonship
His Son, the prototype, has been wrought into us and is awaiting the opportunity to saturate us with His element
We all have been destined to sonship and we are presently undergoing the process of becoming the full sons of God
We have seen that the function of His nature is the working of the law of life and that the moving of His Person is the anointing
When God sent His Only Begotten Son into the world, His intention was to beget many sons through Him, making Him His Firstborn Son
Although the Lord Jesus came the first time as the Only Begotten Son of God when He comes the second time He will come as the Firstborn Son
One day the earth will be filled with the sons of God, and wherever we go, we shall see the image of the Father, the expression of God
Regardless of the kind of life it is-vegetable, animal, human, or divine-as long as it is a life, it has a nature
A dog has a dog's life because it has a dog's nature, and a man has a human life because he has a human nature
The more you speak this way to the dog, the more it will react according to the working of the law of its nature
If, on the contrary, you command the man to behave like the dog, he will find it impossible, for he does not have a dog's nature
Christianity misses this, having never seen the difference between the Only Begotten and the Firstborn Son of God
In the Only Begotten Son there was only divinity, no humanity, but in the Firstborn Son of God there is humanity as well as divinity
In a factory, a company first produces a prototype and then mass-produces the models according to the prototype
The law which has been imparted into our spirit is the function of the divine life; it comes from the nature of the divine life
Since the day this law came into our spirit, it has been awaiting the opportunity to spread into our mind, emotion, and will
With scarcely one exception, nearly all Christians have been distracted from this law and have gone astray from it
Why did God, after giving the law to Moses, still need to use Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and the other prophets?
We have pointed out that the law was given to be a testimony of God, having been given according to the nature of the Lawgiver
God chose Israel from among the nations to be His people, desiring that they would be His people according to what He is
Because the people did go astray God sent the prophets to call them back by rebuking charging and directing them to return to Gods testimony
We are told that the presence of God should mean everything to us and that we must do all things in God's presence
For thousands of years, the angels have been walking in the presence of God, but they have never satisfied Him
For a flea to walk in your presence means nothing, but for a flea to live according to your human nature means a great deal
Because most Christians know only the presence of God but not His nature, it is easy for them to grasp the matter of the anointing
Recently, many have testified that formerly they served in the church by organization, but that now they serve by the anointing
When they hear about the things of life, they respond like the Jews in ancient times, saying, 'This is a hard word; who can hear it'?
As we have pointed out in some of the life-study messages on Genesis, his family functioned as a team to transform him
Should someone have gone to Laban's home and spoken to Jacob, saying, 'Jacob, why are you here wasting your life?
If you stay home, you should stay there not only according to the anointing, but also according to the law of life
When such a brother is at home, he bothers his wife; and when he comes to clean the meeting hall, he bothers the brothers
Do not think that if a dog is in an unclean place, it will bother someone, but if it is in your living room, it will not bother anyone
My wife may be afraid of my being home, and the brothers may be afraid of my coming to the hall, saying, 'Be careful with this brother
Perhaps all of us have misunderstood 1 John 2:27, which says that 'the same anointing teacheth you of all things'
In ancient times, the people of Israel got off the center, which is God's law, and God sent the prophets to bring them back
Rather, it is mentioned in a book dealing with degradation, because many Christians had been distracted by the teachings of the antichrists
He does not care much about what we say to our wives, but He does care about the life by which we speak to them
Any kind of political talk, even if it is about love, is like rotten honey because it originates from our corrupted nature
When we live day by day according to the divine nature, we shall be saturated with Christ and transformed to His image
During the twenty years he was in Laban's home, Jacob did nothing, but he underwent a good deal of transformation
In the church service, it is not just a matter of serving according to the anointing and of not serving according to organization

At the center of God's people, the children of Israel, was the tabernacle which was enclosed by a wall of linen curtains
Our eyes must be opened to see that the Lord's recovery is not so much in the anointing as it is in the law of life
In the New Testament the anointing is mentioned less than twenty times, while life is mentioned more than a hundred times
Its apple-tree life has the apple-tree nature, and issuing from this apple-tree nature is the law of the apple life
Rather, while life grows the law of life functions in the positive sense of shaping us, that is, conforming us to the image of Christ
Though we are occupied with overcoming sin, the world, our ugly flesh, and our bad habits, God would say, 'Forget about these things!
Remember that the law of life is not mainly regulating us; it is mainly shaping us, conforming us to the image of Christ
Although the Bible tells us clearly of the function of the law of life, we have been blinded by our natural concept
Many saints who were seeking after the Lord but who were blinded by their natural concept have written books on how to overcome sin
If we are aware of them and, for the sake of our holiness, try to overcome them, they will rise up and defeat us
There is only the divine life with the divine nature and the divine law which shapes us and conforms us to the image of Christ
As life grows, its law works, not mainly to regulate or correct us, but to shape us, to conform us to the image of the Firstborn Son of God
In His humanity, He was also begotten of God through His resurrection to be the Firstborn Son of God with both divinity and humanity
Now, as the Firstborn Son of God with divinity and humanity, Christ is the model, the pattern, for a mass production
Through His resurrection, all those who believe in Him have also been regenerated to become the many sons of God
We, the many sons of God, who are the many brothers of the Firstborn Son of God, are those who constitute the church
The Firstborn Son of God has been perfected and glorified, and He is now the Pioneer who has entered into the realm of glory
He is also the Captain of our salvation who has fought the battle and who is taking the lead to bring us, His many brothers, into His glory
The house of God is the equivalent of God's dwelling place which was typified by the tabernacle wherein was the Holy of Holies
In the heavens, He, as the High Priest in His kingly and divine priesthood, is ministering into us all that He is and all that He has done
Whatever He is and whatever He has done are now being wrought into us through the working of the law of life in our spirit
Following this, we experience Christ as the incense altar through which we are ushered into the Holy of Holies
