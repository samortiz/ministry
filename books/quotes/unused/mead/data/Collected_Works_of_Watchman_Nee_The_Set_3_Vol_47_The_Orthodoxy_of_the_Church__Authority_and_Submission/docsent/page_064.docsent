   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Warning to the Opinionated Ones Paul</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul was an intelligent, able, wise, and sensible person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was capable and confident in his work, and served God with his own zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When he was on his way to Damascus with a company of men to lay hold of Christians, he suddenly met a great light, which struck him to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In that moment all of his opinions and methods were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All his capabilities were shattered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not go back to Tarsus, nor did he go back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only was his trip to Damascus thrown away; all of his reasons were thrown away as well.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When many encounter difficulties, they turn another direction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If one way is blocked, they try another way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the while they still journey according to their own methods and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many are so foolish that they do not fall even when they are struck by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are only struck by God in the event.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are not struck by God in their reason; their thoughts are still present.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many have been cut off from their way to Damascus, but they still find a way to Tarsus or to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But once Paul was struck, everything was over.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nothing more needed to be said.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nothing more needed to be considered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not know anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He asked the Lord, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here was a man who was submissive from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His thoughts were captured by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Saul had been an outstanding and distinguished person everywhere he went, but when he met the authority of God, all of his opinions were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The biggest mark of a person who has met God is the absence of prejudice and cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to ask for God's mercy that we would be simple in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He who meets God's authority will fall before God's face and spontaneously have no more opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul said that he had been captured by God to be His prisoner.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now is not the time for us to express opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our place is just to listen and submit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>King Saul</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Saul was rejected by God, not for theft but for offering a sacrifice to God of sheep and oxen that he assumed were the best.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was trying to please God by his own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His thoughts were not captured, and he was thus rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One cannot say that Saul was not zealous in his service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were the best of the sheep and the oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The problem, however, was that he made a decision based on his own opinion 1 Sam 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A servant of God cannot express his own opinion; he can only carry out God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should have only one desire: "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If this is not our attitude, we are completely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To obey is better than sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no place for man to express his opinion before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When King Saul saw so many fat sheep and oxen, he wanted to keep some for offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His heart was for God, but his obedience was short.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Having a heart for God cannot replace the words, "I dare not say anything."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And the offerings of the fat cannot replace an attitude of "having no voice" before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God commanded that all the Amalekites with their sheep and oxen be completely destroyed, but Saul was unwilling to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later, the Amalekites killed him, and his reign was stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whoever comes up with a proposal to save the Amalekites will be killed by the Amalekites in the end.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nadab and Abihu</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nadab and Abihu were also rebellious in the matter of sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They did not submit to the authority of their father, but instead made a proposal out of their own initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They committed the sin of offending God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was a sin of offering strange fire, a matter of overstepping God's minister.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although they did not say anything or murmur any reasonings, they burned incense by their own will and according to their own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They thought that this kind of service was a good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If they were wrong, they thought that it was but a mistake in service.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To them it was not a great sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But it turned out that they were immediately rejected by God and immediately died.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Testimony of the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Made Possible Only through Submission</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God does not check on our zeal for the gospel or our willingness to suffer; He checks to see whether or not we are obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Refraining from opinion, stopping all reasonings, ceasing all evil speaking, and submitting to God completely are the beginning of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This will be a day of glory, the day that God has been waiting for since the foundation of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God has a Firstborn who has already submitted, who is the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet God is waiting for all the sons to be conformed identically to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If there is a church on earth that truly submits to God's authority, there will be the testimony of the kingdom, and Satan will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Satan is not afraid of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As long as we stand on the principle of rebellion and act independently by our own will, Satan will laugh in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to the law of Moses, the ark should have been borne by the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But when the Philistines sent the ark back to the Israelites, they did so with an oxcart.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When David desired to receive the ark into the city of David, he did not seek the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, he made his own proposal and pulled the ark by the oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When the oxen stumbled, the ark fell, and Uzzah stretched forth his hand to uphold it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Immediately, he was smitten by God and died.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even if the ark did not fall, it was at most on an oxcart; it was not on the shoulders of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When the Levites lifted the ark across the Jordan, the waves were high.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Yet the ark was in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This tells us one thing: God does not like man's proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Man must forever be submissive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Only when God empties us completely can His will be done unhindered.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we come with our human opinions, service to God will never have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Everything is done through God's ruling, not man's scheming.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Man's opinion must be thoroughly dismantled.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>His thoughts must be shut up; they must be forbidden from making suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the past there was freedom in living by the self.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But when the thoughts are captured, there is no more freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As a result we can be obedient to Christ and have the true freedom, a freedom that is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Second Corinthians 10:6 says, "We are ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Only when the thoughts are captured can obedience be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Everyone who can still maneuver and express opinions before God does not have his obedience fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When our obedience is fulfilled, He will rise up to avenge the disobedient ones.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we would thoroughly turn around and be fearful of our own opinions and proposals, our obedience will be fulfilled, and God will manifest His authority on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If the church cannot be submissive, much less can the world be submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If the church is not submissive, it is vain to hope for others to submit to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Only with a submissive church can there be a submissive response to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>All of us have to learn to be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Our mouths have to be disciplined to stop speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Our minds have to be disciplined to stop reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Our hearts have to be disciplined to stop proposing.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we do this, a way of glory will be before us, and God will manifest His authority on earth.</S>
