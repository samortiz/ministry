   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORGIVENESS THROUGH CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must never neglect God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we must never forget our side either.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is true that the Lord Jesus is presenting His blood and His accomplished work before God continually.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if we sin intentionally, continuously, and without repentance, repudiation, or an inclination to deal with our sins, the work of the Lord's blood will lose its effect and efficaciousness for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The work of the Lord's crucifixion is not just for us, but for the whole world also.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The one work of the Lord Jesus has included everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this work of the Lord can be realized only in those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ's work of advocacy is the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is continuous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regardless of whether a Christian will confess and repent of his sins or not, the cleansing work of Christ is continually effective.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But how this can be realized in the believers is another problem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First John 1:7 tells us that a Christian is forgiven of his sins before God because of the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the other hand, verse 9 shows us what we should do on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First John 2:1 tells us that the Lord Jesus is our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But 1 John 1:9 tells us that on our side we have to confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This does not mean that it is our confession that grants us forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If confession itself can earn forgiveness, the forgiveness is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose that I stole a hundred dollars from a brother, and I go to him and confess my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he forgives me on account of that confession, is he righteous?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If that were the case, I could steal another hundred dollars again and could confess again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If confession alone can earn us forgiveness, this is the most unrighteous thing there is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If that were the case, we could not say that God is faithful and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We would have to say that God is an unrighteous, sloppy God, who overlooks our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why does John say that God is righteous to forgive?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is because the Lord Jesus has become our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His blood has cleansed away all of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our sins have been judged and condemned in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, when we confess our sins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I have stolen money from a brother and someone has paid it back for me, then confession will indeed bring me forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without the blood of the Son of God, God's forgiveness would be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today the blood of the Son of God has been shed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Son of God has become the Advocate before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has to forgive us now.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If He does not forgive, He will be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today when I confess my sins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Word of God tells me that the Lord Jesus has died.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has to be faithful to His own Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He also has to be righteous regarding the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That is why He has to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's forgiveness of our sins is based entirely upon the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sins of the sinners are forgiven through the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The sins of the Christians are likewise forgiven through the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because the Lord Jesus is the Savior, God can forgive the sins of the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because the Lord is the Advocate, God can forgive the sins of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Lord Jesus' being both the Advocate and the Savior, it is His blood that grants us forgiveness of sins and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What then is confession?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The apostle did not say that confession is praying that God would forgive our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many prayers and pleadings before God for forgiveness are not confessions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nor did the apostle say that confession is just to utter something with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What the apostle said was that we have to acknowledge the sin, to treat the sin as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Confession means that we stand on the same ground as God does, admitting before God that our deed is indeed a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The moment you confess your sin, you will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To confess is not to plead for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Forgiveness is the Lord Jesus' business.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What you have to do is judge the sin as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have to judge it, acknowledge it, and confess that it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You have to take sin as sin and treat sin as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What you must confess before God is that a sin is indeed a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you confess your sins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive all your sins and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Just as a sinner receives the forgiveness of sins through the work of the Lord Jesus, a Christian receives the forgiveness of sins from God by judging his sin as sin and through the work of Christ upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Simply put, confession is our saying that something is sin because God says that it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, suppose a brother's child goes out into the street and plays with some bad children.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because he picks up foul language and gets into mischief, the brother brings in the children who have been leading his son to do these things and tells them that they are wrong and that they should no longer play with his child.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He also tells his son not to play with them anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The child says that he wishes to confess that he is wrong and asks for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But although he says this with his mouth, in his heart he is thinking of a way to sneak out the back door to go out and play again.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He does not stand one with his father.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At issue here is not forgiveness, but whether or not we acknowledge something as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Confession means that whatever God considers as sin I also consider as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It means that I say the same as what God has said.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If God says that it is wrong, I say that it is wrong also.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Confession is your recognition and declaration of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When you do it, God forgives your sins and cleanses you from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is not forgiving you because of your confession; He is forgiving you because of the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>His blood is the basis of everything in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But through confession, the blood produces forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Salvation is by the blood through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But forgiveness is by the blood through confession.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is like saying that tap water comes by the source of the water department through the pipes.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the same way, forgiveness comes by the blood through confession.</S>
