   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-EIGHT EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES 74</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son of God who is better than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>h.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Having Made Purification of Sins,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He Having Sat Down on the Right Hand</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>of the Majesty on High until God Makes</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His Enemies a Footstool for His Feet</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ made purification of sins and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high until God makes His enemies a footstool for His feet Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 Having Purified Sins in the Past</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 3 tells us that Christ made purification of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In God s redemption there are three time periods.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, the Lord purified our sins in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has not only propitiated for our sins but also made purification of them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Propitiation means covering, but purification means that our sins have been washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Old Testament type the propitiation was able only to cover sins Psa 32:1 ; it was unable to take away sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So the propitiating priests stood daily, offering the same sacrifices Heb 10:11 , and could never sit down.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Son took away sin John 1:29 and accomplished the purification of sins once for all; hence, He sat down forever Heb 10:10, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the eyes of God, sin is over, and throughout the whole universe sin has been washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sin should not be in us, in the church, or in our home.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sin has been washed away, and the purification of sins has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Son completed this work in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2 Sitting at the Right Hand of God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>in the Present</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hebrews 1:3 goes on to say that Christ sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This clearly refers to the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His ascension Christ, as the ascended Son of God, is much superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is no longer in the tomb or on the earth; He is at the right hand of the Majesty on high.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is His ascension in which He was inaugurated into His office to carry out God s eternal purpose, that is, to build up the church and to bring His many brothers into glory 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Son is now sitting, resting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is sitting on the right hand of God, watching His lovers and seekers experience His purification of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At least five times the book of Hebrews tells us that the Lord Jesus is sitting 1:3, 13; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regarding redemption, He has no work to do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not need to wash us again, for He has thoroughly washed us already.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before we even made our confession, He had already washed us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In fact, we were washed before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord has finished all the work of redemption 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>3 Waiting for the Subduing of the Enemies</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>in the Future</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hebrews 1:13 says, To which of the angels has He ever said, Sit at My right hand until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet ?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ the Son is waiting for His enemies to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will occur in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord lacks nothing except a footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He has the throne and the crown, but He does not yet have the footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Be assured that one day He will obtain this footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is sitting at the right hand of God until God makes all His enemies and adversaries serve Christ as a footstool for His rest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we are still in the period of until, the period of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are still in the time when God is working to bring all His enemies under the feet of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The book of Hebrews stresses the fact that Christ has accomplished everything for God and us, leaving nothing for us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His sitting at the right hand of God signifies that His work has been accomplished and that He is resting there, waiting for only one thing that God will make His enemies a footstool for His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is sitting there in the heavens waiting for a footstool that He may have complete rest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>i.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Being Begotten to Be the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>and Coming Back as God s Firstborn</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is also in resurrection that Christ is declared to be the Son of God who is superior to the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Resurrection means a new beginning; it denotes germination.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 3 refers to His death by saying, Having made purification of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 5 indicates His resurrection by which He was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33 as the beginning of a new age, the age of the church, which is composed of His many brothers born of God through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In God s economy, God has the firstborn Son and the many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before Christ was incarnated, God had only one, unique Son.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the Bible this Son is called the only Begotten John 1:14, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>John 3:16, a verse familiar to every Christian, says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God s only begotten Son was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Before His death and resurrection, Christ was the unique Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The New Testament reveals that through Christ s death and resurrection the many sons of God were born 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Early in the morning of the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus said to Mary, Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He never called His disciples brothers before that morning.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even in John 15 He said, No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends v. 15 . The most intimate term He used regarding His disciples before His resurrection was friends.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But after His resurrection, He met one of His female disciples and told her to go to His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This was prophesied in Psalm 22.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The first words of this psalm, My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? were spoken by the Lord when He was on the cross Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The first twenty-one verses of Psalm 22 speak of the Lord s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Suddenly, verse 22 says, I will declare Your name to my brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This proves that He passed through death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After He passed through death and resurrection, the many brothers were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He was that one grain of wheat, which through death and resurrection became many grains John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Now God has many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He not only has the only begotten Son but also the many sons with the Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Before His resurrection Christ was the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After His resurrection, since the many sons of God have been produced, He became God s firstborn Son with many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Before Jesus Christ was resurrected, God did not have a firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He just had the only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What is the difference between the firstborn Son and the only begotten Son?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As the only begotten Son, Christ did not have the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He had only the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When He was incarnated, He put on human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The thirty-three and a half years of His life on earth were a transitory state.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>On the one hand, He was still the only begotten Son of God; on the other hand, He had put on human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The divine nature within Him was the Son of God but the human nature was not.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, during those thirty-three and a half years, Jesus was quite peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He had the divine nature that was the Son of God but He also put on the human nature that was not the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>That human nature had not been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>According to His divinity, His divine nature, He was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But before His resurrection, He had something that was not born of God the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He needed to pass through death and resurrection in order for that human part to be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Psalm 2:7 is a strong basis for this: You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>What was prophesied in Psalm 2:7 was fulfilled on the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is indicated by Acts 13:33 which, referring to the resurrection of Christ, quotes this verse from Psalm 2.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In His human nature Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>After this, He became the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Now, as the firstborn Son, He has both the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>As the only begotten Son of God, He did not have the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>While He was on earth after His incarnation, He had the human nature, but in those thirty-three and a half years His human nature had not been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It was through His resurrection that the human part of His being was born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>By this begetting, He became the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>While the only begotten Son of God had only the divine nature and not the human nature, Jesus today as the firstborn Son of God has both natures.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The firstborn Son of God is not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>As the Son of God, He is superior to the angels in His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Hebrews 1:6 alludes to this.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When He brings again the Firstborn into the inhabited earth, He says, And let all the angels of God worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We know that this verse refers to the second coming because it speaks of Christ as the Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In His first coming, He was God s only begotten Son John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>As the only begotten Son of God, Christ possessed divinity but not humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In incarnation, however, Christ as the only begotten Son of God became the Son of Man, and in resurrection He was born in His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Therefore, when Christ returns, He will not come in the same status that He had when He came to the earth the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Christ came to the earth the first time as the only begotten Son of God, but He will come the second time as the firstborn Son of God, the Son of God possessing both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In other words, when God brought Christ to earth the first time, He came in His status as the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In such a status, He became the Son of Man in His incarnation, and as the Son of Man He was begotten to be the Son of God in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Hence, when God brings Him to the inhabited earth the second time, He will come in His status as the firstborn Son of God, a status in which He is both the Son of God and the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>For this reason, He declared to the Jewish opposers in Matthew 26 that they would see Him coming back as the Son of Man on the clouds of heaven v. 64 . When God brings Christ again into the inhabited earth as the Firstborn, all the angels will worship Him.</S>
