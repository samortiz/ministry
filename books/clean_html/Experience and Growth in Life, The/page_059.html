<p>Question: What is a practical example of dealing with our disposition?<p>Answer: In the New Testament, disposition and character are implied in such terms as self, soul-life, the old man, and the I in Galatians 2:20. These things are all related to the natural life. However, these terms are too general, and their particular meaning and denotation have been lost. But to say that we must deal with our disposition and character is very particular. Actually, to deal with our disposition means to deal with our self, our old man, our soul-life, and the I.<p>Question: Is transformation the addition of God’s element to our God-given disposition?<p>Answer: In describing our relationship with the Lord, many different kinds of terminology have been used. The terminology may be different, but the fact is the same. However, some terminology is not very accurate and can be very misleading. Some have said that we as Christians live an exchanged life. This terminology is absolutely wrong. It is better to say that we live a grafted life. To live an exchanged life can be illustrated by exchanging a watch for a set of eyeglasses. The watch and the eyeglasses are two different things. But to live a grafted life means that two lives have been grafted, even mingled, together. They have been grafted, but both lives continue to exist. On one hand, we are finished, but on the other hand, we still live, as what is unveiled in Galatians 2:20. We are finished in the death of Christ, and we live in the resurrection of Christ. Thus, even in eternity we will continue to live with the divine element added to, grafted to, and mingled with our being. This does not change our nature or characteristic. Our nature and characteristic will remain forever, with something new and living added.<p>Before we received Christ, we were just ourselves with our nature and characteristic. After we received Christ, we were still ourselves but with something living and new added. This new and living element did not eliminate our nature. Our being still remains. In eternity we will see and recognize all the brothers and sisters, but they will be much newer and much more living. In the past, before we received Christ, we lived by ourselves; but now we live by Christ who lives in us (Gal. 2:20), not in an old way but in an entirely new way.<p>Transformation deals mainly with our disposition, and renewal deals mainly with our character. Both transformation and renewal simply mean to deal with our disposition and character. A transformed person will not remain in his old disposition, and a renewed person will not remain in his old character or expression.<p>Question: Is dealing with our disposition and character different from being changed by the divine dispensing?<p>Answer: The divine dispensing always works to transform us, not only to correct or change us. To change is just to change yourself by your own effort. To transform indicates something divine, something of the Lord, which you do not have by your habits or birth. By the divine dispensing, a divine element is dispensed into you. This element works in you to transform you. If your countenance is pale, through eating, the element of the food will transform your pale color into a healthy color. This healthy color is a transformed color. Without the divine element dispensed into you, you could only have a change but not transformation.<p>In order for us to experience this transformation, there is the need of the breaking of our disposition and character because our disposition and character are the greatest obstacles to God’s dispensing of Himself into us and to His transforming and renewing work on us.
