<h1 class="title">THE THREE DISPENSATIONS<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S DEALING WITH MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 17:30-31</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The first period&mdash;God was overlooking
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the first period, God allowed man to do whatever he wanted. It seems that God did not concern Himself too much with what man did. This was God&rsquo;s overlooking.</li>
	<li>This period was also the time of man&rsquo;s ignorance. Because the gospel had not yet been preached, and because man was without the light of God&rsquo;s revelation, he was in ignorance. Prior to the gospel age God overlooked much and let man go his own way.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The second period&mdash;God commands men to repent
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>During the second period, God concerns Himself with what man does. This is the period when God visits men, seeks men, and saves men. He commands all men to repent and be saved.</li>
	<li>Since the beginning of the human race, the things concerning God were never preached in such a clear way until the gospel age. In this period, God gives special revelation to man. Through the gospel He gives light to men that they may know God. So there can be no excuse for men not knowing God.</li>
	<li>This period is called the gospel period. During this time God&rsquo;s purpose is to save men, and God&rsquo;s work is to have the gospel preached that they may be saved. Therefore, in this period man should repent, believe, and receive God&rsquo;s salvation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The third period&mdash;God will judge men
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When the gospel period has passed, God will judge the whole world in the day which He has appointed.</li>
	<li>The future judgment will be according to God&rsquo;s righteousness as well as man&rsquo;s deeds or works. But because by works no one is perfect, all will be condemned and the result will be eternal perdition.</li>
	<li>While today God saves man through Jesus Christ, in the future God will judge man through Jesus Christ. As He is the Savior today, so shall He be the Lord of Judgment in that day.</li>
	<li>If a man receives Christ today, to him Christ is a Savior. If a man does not receive Christ today, he will still have to meet Him in the future. At that time Christ will be the Lord of Judgment to him. Sooner or later all men will face the Lord. No man will be able to escape His presence. If today, under grace, you do not get involved with Him as your Savior, you will still have to get involved with Him that day. Today, He is your Savior; if not, in that day He will be your Judge. Whether He is your Savior or your Judge is not up to Him; it is up to you. You cannot avoid this decision; please make your decision now.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s saving way
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God raised Jesus from the dead; this is God&rsquo;s saving way. By Jesus&rsquo; death, man&rsquo;s sins are taken away, and by His resurrection, man may obtain eternal life. This eternal life is the very life of God.</li>
	<li>Today, as we are in the gospel period, those who do not believe in Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection nor accept His salvation will come under His judgment in that day.</li>
	<li>Jesus died and was resurrected. This is a faithful saying. When you receive the Lord Jesus you are not receiving a historical figure, but a living and real Savior. How do you know that Jesus died for sinners? Because Jesus was resurrected! Jesus is not a dead historical figure, but a living and real Savior. He works miracles, brings men from darkness into light, makes the weak strong, turns the hearts of men, and hearkens to the prayers of men. All these prove that Jesus is a living Savior.</li>
	<li>Men receive God&rsquo;s salvation by believing. Believe that the Lord Jesus has died and resurrected to save you from sin and from judgment.</li>
	<li>To believe you must first repent. In the gospel period, God specifically wants men to repent. Repent and believe, and you will be saved, and will not be judged in that day.</li>
