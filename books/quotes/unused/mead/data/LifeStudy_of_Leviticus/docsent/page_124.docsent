   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. ALL DEAD THINGS BEING UNCLEAN, AND DEATH BEING MORE DEFILING AND ABOMINABLE THAN SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All dead things are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Uncleanness, therefore, equals death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Death is more defiling and abominable than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But according to our concept, sin is more serious than death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not have the right concept concerning death, it will not be easy for us to realize that death is more defiling than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of our ethical and moral concepts, we know that lying is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If someone lies to us, we shall condemn that lie as sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, we may not realize that talk which is ethical may nevertheless be filled with death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, we may not realize talking with a brother about his family may involve death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such talk may be ethical but still be filled with death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Using another illustration, I would point out that even giving a book to a brother may involve death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose a brother gives a book to another brother with the intention of pleasing him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even such a good thing may be filled with death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should give something to a brother not with the purpose of pleasing him but simply because we are following the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is political to have a purpose, an intention, when we give something to a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose one's intention in giving a book to a brother is to please the brother so that he will then stand with the one who gave him the book.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This kind of intention is filled with death, and those who have spiritual understanding, spiritual discernment, will recognize it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The issue of giving a book with this intention is the forming of a party, and such a party will spread death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, the one who receives the book will be defiled by death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then between these two brothers who have formed a party, there will be nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The giving of the book was apparently good, but it involved death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From this illustration we can see that death is more hidden than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not easy for us to see through a thing and discern that it is filled with death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A deed like the giving of a book may have a very good appearance but may actually be filled with the uncleanness of death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Death surely is more defiling and abominable than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A. Through a Trespass Offering Any Sin Shall Be Forgiven Immediately</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Leviticus 5 reveals that through the trespass offering any sin shall be forgiven immediately vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2, 17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From this we see that to deal with sin, to have sin forgiven, is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We simply offer the trespass offering, and then we are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. A Person Touching the Carcass of Any Animal Shall Be Unclean until the Evening, and a Person Touching the Carcass of Any Man Shall Be Unclean Seven Days</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Leviticus 11, a person touching the carcass of any animal shall be unclean until the evening vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>24-25, 27b-28a, 31b, 39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Until the evening" means until the end of one's daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that it takes time for us to be cleansed from the defilement of death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our experience proves this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we commit a trespass and then confess it to the Lord, we shall be forgiven immediately, and the matter is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if we are defiled by death, we cannot be cleansed "until the evening."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that a certain period of time must pass before we can be cleansed from the defilement of death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Time is not a factor in being forgiven of our sins, but it is a factor in being cleansed from the defilement of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We Christians deal with sins simply by confessing them and applying the Lord's precious blood to our case.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As soon as we do this, we are forgiven and cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, if we touch a "carcass" and are thereby defiled by death, this defilement will remain with us for quite a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although it does not take time for us to be cleansed from sin, it does take time for us to be cleansed from the defilement of death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This proves that death defiles us more and longer than sin does.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whereas a person who touches the carcass of an animal shall be unclean until the evening, a person who touches the carcass of a man shall be unclean seven days Num 19:11,13 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates not only that death is more serious than sin, but also that the carcass of a man is more defiling than the carcass of an animal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the sight of God, human beings are the most defiling element.</S>
