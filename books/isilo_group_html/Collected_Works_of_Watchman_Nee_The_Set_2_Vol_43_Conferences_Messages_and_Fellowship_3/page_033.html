We have seen the blood, the flesh, the crucifixion, and the bearing of the cross. We have already seen the first two items in detail, concerning how Christ propitiated our sins with His blood and how He crucified the old man. The blood and the crucifixion are related to our being in Christ. The flesh and the bearing of the cross are related to Christ being in us. The work of Christ can be divided into two parts: we in Him and He in us. In John 15:4 the Lord said, "Abide in Me and I in you." The first two items of the work of Christ relate to "Abide in Me." The last two items relate to "I in you." The blood and the crucifixion relate to what we have obtained in Christ. The flesh and the bearing of the cross, which we will talk about, relate to what Christ will accomplish within us. In order for us to be in Christ, we must believe, and in order for Christ to be in us, we must obey. Believing and obeying are the two most important matters to a Christian.</p><p>Believing means believing that we are already in Christ and that we are already one with Him. All that He has is ours, and all of His experiences are our experiences. A living faith believes that all that Christ has is ours. However, Christ being in us requires not only faith but also obedience. We need to obey His leading. Sometimes He works in us by urging us and sometimes by stopping us. Sometimes when we remain still, He lets us know what we should do. Sometimes when we act by our flesh, He stops us inwardly and discourages us from doing what we should not do. The Lord is either urging or stopping us all the time from within. Believing and obeying mean that we are willing to go along with His urging and stopping. Very often we sense a voice that is not quite a voice, a feeling that is not quite a feeling; it is something that we cannot see, hear, or touch, yet something quite visible, audible, and touchable. This something within us tells us what we should or should not do. Often when we talk too much, this something within will stop us. Obedience means obeying this something. It is not just obeying the Scriptures but also obeying this inward leading. In order to live an overcoming life, one must know what faith and obedience are. If there is no living faith or obedience, we will only have doctrines in our mind; there will be nothing in our spirit.</p><p>A Christian should receive all that is in Christ through faith and receive all that Christ is in us through obedience. The way of victory consists of two things&mdash;faith and obedience. The blood is related to faith rather than obedience because the blood is a work of Christ. Christ's work can only be obtained by faith, not by obedience. Similarly, the crucifixion of the old man is by faith, not by obedience. We must exercise our faith to believe that we are already in Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">"BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED THEM,<br />AND YOU WILL HAVE THEM"</h2><p>Tonight let us consider the meaning of a living faith. Only after we know what a living faith is can we exercise this faith. How can we receive the riches of Christ? Everyone knows the word faith, but the faith of many people is not truly faith; their faith does not produce any effect on them. The Bible tells us that the old man is dead. Many people say that they believe this, but their faith is not effectual. They do not seem to have died at all. Let us look into the Scripture to find out what kind of faith is truly faith.</p><p>To many people, faith is merely a mental consent; it is not a genuine believing in the heart. In their mind they agree that something is good and logical. Brothers and sisters, never consider this as faith; this is merely a mental reckoning. After one hears a doctrine, he may appreciate its excellence and logic. But knowing a good doctrine does not mean that one has faith in the doctrine.</p><p>What is faith? Let us consider what the Lord said in Mark 11:24: "All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them." This is the only place in the entire Bible that tells us what faith is. We must understand what is being said in this verse before we can know what faith is. This is the only verse in the entire Bible that tells us the way to believe. "Believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</p><p>What is faith? Faith is believing that we have already received. It is not believing that we can receive, will receive, shall receive, or want to receive. Faith is believing that we have already received. Perhaps you do not realize how great a difference this makes. If a person believes he can receive, may receive, will receive, or wants to receive, his faith is not real. Only one kind of faith is real&mdash;living faith. Only one kind of faith can receive God's promise. Only one kind of faith secures the riches of Christ for us. It is the faith that believes that we have already received. The problem today is that many of God's children think that they have faith and that they will receive. They do not realize, however, that even if they believe ten million times that way, they still will not receive. God does not consider this kind of believing as faith; He ignores it. Only one kind of faith is acceptable to God. The word "have" in Mark 11:24 is a very important word. If we believe that we have received something, we will have it. If we hope that we will receive it, whatever we have is not faith.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 43: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (3) &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
