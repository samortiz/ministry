   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SELECTING MATERIAL THAT IS LIVING,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT NEW AND UNUSUAL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our preparation to minister the word, we must look for material that is living, not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If those who minister the word desire to be different from others, they will be tempted to select material that is new and unusual but also dead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, their messages are frivolous and do not have the taste of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, when we prepare a message, we should avoid the thought of being original by using material that is new and unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, we should endeavor to give messages that are living and full of life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, though others have spoken concerning regeneration many times, we should still speak of it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Regeneration is an old topic that does not have anything new or unusual, but if our material is living, our speaking will be full of supply and taste.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we only care to tell stories and neglect the supply of life, we are simply professional storytellers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the saints may laugh, our speaking will be an offense to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AVOIDING THE EXPOUNDING OF SCRIPTURE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When looking for material, we should avoid expounding Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible is not a simple book.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we speak from the Bible, we will not have many problems, but if we expound the Bible, we will have many problems, because speaking from the Bible is different from expounding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can release a message based on a few verses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, when we quote Hebrews 2:3, How shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation, to stir up people s appreciation of salvation, we are speaking from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when we try to explain the meaning of the words salvation and neglect, we are expounding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who speak from the podium must avoid expounding Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They can speak from the Bible, but they should not expound it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Expounding the Bible is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we should avoid material that expounds Scripture since such material does not contain much life and is subject to error.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Strictly speaking, only those with the gift of teaching should expound Scripture, and not everyone has this gift.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The words in the Bible can be used to speak a message, but expounding the Bible can cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, it is best to avoid books that expound the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most of the books that expound the Bible impart knowledge to people but do not supply much life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In addition, there are many ways to expound the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same portion of the Word often has many different interpretations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I was young, I read a good book concerning the seventy weeks in the book of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After reading the book, I began to speak what I had learned to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I later realized that I was behaving like a fool, and I laughed at myself because there are many interpretations of the seventy weeks, and each interpretation seems logical.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a serious matter to expound the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should try our best to avoid expounding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Throughout the centuries most sermons were based on Bible verses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, Dr. John Sung used the flow of blood in Luke 8:43 to give a sermon on the Lord s precious blood, without expounding the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should avoid expounding the Bible unless we are establishing a biblical basis.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Exposition is to meet a need for establishing a biblical basis.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should expound the Bible within the boundary of this real basis.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should stay within this boundary; otherwise, our message will be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must hold on to the basic principle that the message must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we want our message to be living, we cannot speak empty doctrine; we must not merely expound the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should expound the Bible only when we need a biblical basis to convey a thought to people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As long as such a need is met, there is no need for much explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, quoting others may cause confusion among the saints because of the different viewpoints in the expositions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first time I read the Bible, I spent much time reading reference books concerning the prophecies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Matthew 24 the Lord Jesus said that two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left v. 41 . An authoritative expositor among the Brethren said that the one who was left was the best, and he gave many reasons in support.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How can the better one be left?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We believe that the one who was taken was better.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, if we do not have discernment, we will be misled.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are many books in Christianity, so the ministers of the word are often tempted to use them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although they need to consult different books, some of these books are inaccurate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, Andrew Murray truly knew the Lord inwardly, but his expositions were not always accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can rely on his spiritual experiences, but we cannot always rely on him in Bible expositions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When Brother T. Austin-Sparks was in Taiwan, he said that the New Jerusalem did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He went beyond his portion and began to expound the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot accept this exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even though we highly regard the spiritual matters Brother Austin-Sparks ministered to us, we cannot go along with this exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If there is no New Jerusalem, where will the believers be?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For this reason we have been very careful in the matter of exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Generally speaking, it is not difficult to select material for the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if we are not absolutely sure concerning material that expounds the Bible, we should not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We also should not attempt to expound the Scripture unless it is absolutely necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Throughout the centuries different spiritual persons have expounded the Bible, but it was difficult for them not to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Andrew Murray, Brother Austin-Sparks, and even Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis made serious mistakes in exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those of the inner life had good spiritual experiences but were far off in expounding Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sister Dora Yu was very spiritual, but she also was inaccurate in expounding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She said that being saved was not equivalent to being regenerated, and those who were saved still needed to repent in order to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, we need to avoid Bible exposition when we select material.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is best not to select material that touches Bible exposition unless there is a definite need, and we are sure of its accuracy.</S>
