   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING SUBMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY First Finding Out the Deputy Authority</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Witness Lee: How can one see the authority of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Watchman Nee: The submission of some people seems to be selective.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to practice submission, the first thing to ask is who is above me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we go to work in the secular world, we should first ask who the boss is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do not get this question settled, we will not be able to do a proper job, not to mention the possibility of being punished.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The same principle applies to working in an office or in an institution.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first thing that comes to the mind of many people when they sit down is how to be the boss.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These people need to learn a serious lesson of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Submission is a lesson that a man has to learn before God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to be disciplined to such an extent that we bear a submissive nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever any brother or sister or co-worker goes to a place, he or she has to find out who his or her authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, the brothers and sisters who are staying at our guest houses have to submit to the authority in that house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When they come to the meeting, they have to submit to the ushers and have to sit where they are told to sit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every house that you stay in has its own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Christian should learn to look for authority and to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All those who pretend to be the head do not know what headship means in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Submission without Any Preference</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have never seen a man who knows the Head yet does not submit to Christ's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A person who knows the Lord will never be selective in the matter of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, Brother Witness's children cannot be selective in their submission to their father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a brother or a sister has not learned to submit to every deputy authority assigned by the Lord, he is under the greatest deception.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible says that there is no authority except from God Rom 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are very few places in the Bible that speak of direct submission to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most of the time the Bible speaks of submission to man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wherever you go, you have to submit, not criticize freely with your lips.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If others give you some special authority, that is up to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, you have to learn to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people have never learned the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Wherever they go, they tear down the authorities, and they do not bridle their tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of person is rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we will not be wild Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only should we not be selective in our submission, but we should actively seek after the ones we should submit to.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Submission to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Being the Nature of the Lord's Life</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I was staying in London, everything was set up by the host.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the morning we woke up at six o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At noon we had our meal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At three o'clock in the afternoon, we had our afternoon tea.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One Swiss brother from Japan shook his head and sighed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I asked why he was so unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was fifteen years older than I was, and he made tens of thousands of pounds every year.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He had a few thousand workers working under him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He told me that he was having a hard time because he had not been a student for over twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the guest house where he was staying, the brother in charge was a rather uneducated person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was very unpleasant for this Swiss brother to come under that brother's supervision.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I stayed in London for eighteen months.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If I had not learned submission, but instead criticized and opposed, how could I have been happy within?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Submission is the nature of the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is for our protection to submit to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Learning Submission in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A Christian should learn coordination, and coordination comes from submission.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A rebellious and independent person is one who will not be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christians should learn to submit one to another and to be delivered from rebellious acts, critical words, and reviling conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not only should a person have the realization of authority in the church and in the Body, but when he is alone, he should still have this realization.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We learn submission first in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is rather difficult to learn submission outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is more natural to learn submission in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is God's protection; it keeps us from exposing ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we learn the lesson this way, the spirit of antichrist will be removed from us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>SUBMISSION TO THE GOVERNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Concerning submission to our government, we know that no Christian can overturn any government.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If certain political factors are contrary to our faith, the most we can do is escape.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is like what the Lord says, that we escape from one city to another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the Bible escaping is not a shameful thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If a government is not good, we can escape.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But at the same time, all Christians should still pray for the governments that are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One brother asked: If there are government-enacted laws which the government itself does not keep, should a Christian still keep them?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Watchman Nee: We still have to keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But under certain circumstances, there are laws which a Christian cannot keep.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brother D. M. Panton once said that if a law is itself unlawful, we do not have to consider whether or not to keep that law.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For example, Pharaoh ordered all the Hebrews to kill their male children.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The midwives did not obey this order, yet the Bible says that God dealt well with them Exo 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Moses' mother did not obey the order of Pharaoh 2:1-2 , yet Hebrews 11 praised her faith.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is because Pharaoh's law was itself a lawless order.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the New Testament Peter and John were acting under the same principle when they disobeyed the order of the high priest.</S>
