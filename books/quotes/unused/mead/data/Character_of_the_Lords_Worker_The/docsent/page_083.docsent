   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many difficulties arise in the church today because God's children sacrifice the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A local church became divided after a brother said, "I had no intention to be separated from you, but last night something happened in the church, and I was not informed of it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today I will no longer meet with you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The truth is absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the brother's separation of himself was right, he should have done so even if he had been informed of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Likewise, if the brother's separation of himself was wrong, he should not have done so even when he was not informed of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he is absolute for the truth, the act of informing him bears no significance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If his separation is based on a lack of informing, man has been elevated above the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Another place wanted to have separate tables and to break bread separately because a brother was offended when he asked a question in the meeting and did not receive an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If it was right for him to separate himself, he should have started another table much sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If it was wrong for him to separate himself, he should not make an excuse of not receiving an answer to his question.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is what it means to be absolute to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If having separate tables is according to the truth, there should be separate tables, even if the brothers are attached to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If having separate tables is not according to the truth, there should not be separate tables, even if there are offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must deny all forms of self before we can serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there is any pride, selfishness, or thought of receiving respectable treatment as a condition for upholding God's word, we are putting ourselves above God's truth; we are saying that we are more important than His truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This disqualifies us from His service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our service to the Lord, we have to deny ourselves absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether or not we like what is happening and whether or not we feel hurt about something have nothing to do with the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If something must be done one way, it must be done that way no matter how we feel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if we suffer greatly by doing so, we still have to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even if others mistreat us, despise us, or count us worthless, we still have to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot force God's truth to go our way just because we want to go that way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man is too bold; he always forces God's truth to follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to see the glory of God's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot project our own feelings into His truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we stand beside God's truth, we should not just consider ourselves to be smaller than it; we should consider ourselves to be non-existent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we involve the self even a little, we will end up with trouble immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A brother, who had been criticized in some quarters, came to the church and felt quite happy about the contacts he made.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He felt that he had been unjustly criticized where he had been, but he did not really touch the truth before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was merely impressed by a few of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a brother was very undisciplined in his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some time later another brother said to him, "Brother, you have been too loose," and he proceeded to point out some of the things that the new brother had done.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was a speaking of truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when the new brother heard this, he left, remarking in anger, "No wonder so many people are against this church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It should be criticized."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, this brother was not absolute to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he had been absolute to the truth, he would not have said this when he was rebuked by others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because he was not absolute to the truth, he changed his tone as soon as he was rebuked.</S>
