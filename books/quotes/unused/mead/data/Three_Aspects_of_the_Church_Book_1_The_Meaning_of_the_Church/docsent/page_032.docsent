   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 3 THE SHULAMMITE The Shulammite</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Typifying the Church s Experience</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Resurrected Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and Her Enjoyment of Rest with Him David and Solomon Typifying</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ in His Two Aspects</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Old Testament the seventh and last woman to typify the church is the Shulammite S. S. 6:13 . The Shulammite was Solomon s queen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Solomon typifies the resurrected and glorified Christ; hence, the Shulammite typifies the church in resurrection and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some people think that Christ s glorification will begin with His second coming; however, the Bible clearly reveals that Christ entered into glory after His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Luke 24:26 the Lord said to two of His disciples on the road to Emmaus, Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that the Lord entered into glory as soon as He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In principle, Christ s being in the heavens now, His coming back to the earth in the future, and His living in us and being with us today are all in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Solomon is a type of Christ in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before Christ was glorified, He experienced on the earth all kinds of sufferings and eventually death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>David typifies the Christ who passed through all kinds of sufferings, and David s wife, Abigail, typifies the church in the midst of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Solomon typifies the glorification of Christ, and the Shulammite, the queen of Solomon, typifies the church reigning in glory and enjoying the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The entire book of Song of Songs portrays how the Shulammite experienced and enjoyed Solomon, typifying the church s experience and enjoyment of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Christ in Song of Songs is the resurrected Christ who passed through death, came out of death, and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today the Christ in us is the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Christ whom we experience every day is the One who passed through all kinds of sufferings, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that the Christ whom we contact and with whom we fellowship is the Christ in Song of Songs, the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we walk on the earth by relying on the resurrected Christ, we live out Christ in suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only by the power of resurrection can we take the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>David and Solomon, as types of Christ, are related.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Solomon, as a type, did not come into being after the death of David but rather while David was still living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>David and Solomon typify two aspects of a shared experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>David typifies the lowly aspect of Jesus, that is, His footsteps in His living; Solomon typifies the glorious aspect of Christ, that is, His power in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord was first Jesus and then Christ, first David and then Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, in our experience He is first Christ and then Jesus, first Solomon and then David.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the beginning the One whom we contacted was not Jesus but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The expression believing into Jesus is not according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the New Testament we cannot find such an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jesus was a man into whom we have no way to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The One into whom we believe is the Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He overcame the constraints of man, resurrected, and is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He came out of death and entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This glory is resurrection and also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The three the Spirit, resurrection, and glory cannot be separated; they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once the Lord entered into resurrection, He entered into glory; that is, He entered into the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At that time, strictly speaking, He was not merely Jesus but the Christ; He was Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was Jesus becoming the Christ in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, the One into whom we believe is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Scriptures there are the expressions believed into Christ Jesus and faith in Christ Jesus Gal 2:16; 3:26; Phil 3:9; 2 Tim 3:15 , but there is no such expression as believing into Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, the One whom we first contacted is the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is in resurrection, that is, in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through our believing, He touched our inner being, and our inner being touched Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This may be likened to the radio waves in the air coming into contact with a radio transmitter, which corresponds to the radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Similarly, the faith in us corresponds to the law of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Spirit touches our inner being, our inner being touches the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Spirit is resurrection, and He is the Christ into whom we believe and whom we contact.</S>
