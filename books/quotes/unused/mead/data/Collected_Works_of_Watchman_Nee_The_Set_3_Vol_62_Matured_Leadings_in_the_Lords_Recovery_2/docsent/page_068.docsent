   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THINGS TO TAKE CARE OF IN OUR VISITATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The brothers and sisters should take care of a few things in their visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not Having the Thought of Going to Teach Others</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, in visiting others we should not have the thought that we are going to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not think that we know more than others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A teaching spirit is a proud spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It will only debilitate others' spirits; it will not edify and supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaiah 50 says we must have a tongue of a learner before we can strengthen the weak with our words v. 4 . We must learn to listen, to fellowship with the Lord in our spirit, and to look to Him for light before we can help others with a suitable word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our Words Must Be Accurate and Full of Supply</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In visiting others we have to be careful with our words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our words must be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many words should be held back, and we should not speak them easily.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Often our words are inaccurate because our tongue is untamed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of us think that we are only wild in our thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, we are wild in our speaking as well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we apply ourselves to learn this lesson, we will discover that the tongue is just as difficult to bridle as the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1935 God asked me to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He wanted me to learn to be accurate in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time I felt this was very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Within one day I would apologize to others many times.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once my child was filling a tub with water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>About eight to ten drops of water spilled onto the floor because his hands were shaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I saw this I rebuked him, saying, "How can you wet the whole floor?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After I said this something within me said, "Not even half of the floor is wet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can you say that he has wet the whole floor?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I had to apologize to my son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times the Holy Spirit is released through our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But many times death is also released through our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, never talk about things related to church service when visiting others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If others ask us about a certain elder, we should not answer him directly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times such discussions turn into gossip, criticism, and complaints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The result is death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should learn to be accurate in the words we use in our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should only speak words that supply life and should not touch gossip, criticism, and condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not Raising Arguments</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In visiting the brothers and sisters, we must be careful to not raise any arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If brothers and sisters have questions regarding the church, individuals, the truth, or the work, we should not argue with them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We visit them because we care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not there to discuss what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If arguments occur in our visitation, it is to no one's benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such arguments will only bring both parties into the darkness of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, in visiting others, we should avoid arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If our spirit is strong enough we will do our best to lead people to touch God in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way, we will avoid many negative problems.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>ARRANGEMENTS CONCERNING VISITATION</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>FOR SHEPHERDING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The assignment of visitation should be based on the name lists which are distributed to the various districts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our visitation should pay much attention to the care of the new ones and to conducting make-up lessons for them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The assignment of visitation in the various districts should be open to changes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the number of those engaged in visitation in a district is not enough, the church should assign saints from other districts to come to the aid of this district.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Church visitation is for making up the lack in district visitations.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are a few kinds of visitations which can come under the description of church visitations.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Special Visitations</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Visitation for special occasions includes many things, such as funerals, marriages, moving, changing jobs, starting new jobs, unemployment, sickness, etc. Anything that a man encounters which causes a change in the environment can be considered a special occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The most dangerous period that a man faces is in the transitional time when he experiences a change in his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church has to strengthen such a one with visitations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everyone moving to Hong Kong as well as every visitor should receive proper hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church has to pay attention to all the needs that accompany changes in the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the church can cover this kind of visitation work, it will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if it does not do anything, nothing will happen.</S>
