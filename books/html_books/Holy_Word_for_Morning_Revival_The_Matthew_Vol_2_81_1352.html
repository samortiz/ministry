And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</p> <p>5 &nbsp;And...a centurion came...beseeching Him</p><p>6 &nbsp;And saying, Lord, my servant is lying in the house paralyzed, terribly tormented.</p><p>7 &nbsp;And He said to him, I will come and heal him.</p><p class="bold">8 &nbsp;But the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not fit for You to enter under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.</p> <p class="bold">9 &nbsp;For I also am a man under <sup>1</sup>authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes;...and to my slave, Do this, and he does it.</p> <p class="bold">10 &nbsp;Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, With no one in Israel have I found such great faith.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>2<sup>1</sup> The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior to be the people of the kingdom is represented by a leper. According to the examples in the Scriptures, leprosy results from rebellion and disobedience. Miriam became leprous because of her rebellion against God&#8217;s deputy authority (Num. 12:1-10). Naaman&#8217;s leprosy was cleansed because of his obedience (2 Kings 5:1, 9-14). All fallen human beings have become leprous in the eyes of God because of their rebellion. The kingly Savior came to save men from their rebellion and to cleanse them from their leprosy that they might become His kingdom people.</p><p>3<sup>1</sup> According to the law, a leper was to be isolated from the people because of his uncleanness. No one was allowed to touch him (Lev. 13:45-46). But the new King, as a man and as the kingly Savior, touched this leper. What mercy and sympathy! By His one touch, his leprosy was immediately cleansed. What wonderful cleansing!</p><p>9<sup>1</sup> The centurion, a Gentile, recognized the authority of the kingly Savior and realized that His word had the authority to heal. Thus, he believed not only in the kingly Savior but also in His word, asking Him not to go in person but only to speak the word. This was stronger faith, and it was marveled at by the Savior (v. 10).</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In Matthew 8:1-17 three miracles-the cleansing of the leper, the healing of the paralyzed Gentile servant, and the healing of Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law-and the healing of many are grouped together to present a meaningful doctrine, that is, they have a dispensational significance.</p><p>The diseases healed in the cases recorded in Matthew 8 are significant, for every disease signifies a specific spiritual sickness. The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior to be the people of the kingdom is represented by a leper....The leper here represents the Jews. The Jews have become rebellious against God....Nevertheless, the heavenly King came...not to judge them, but to heal them....He came as a Physician to heal the sick [9:12].</p><p>The Jewish leper was healed by the King&#8217;s direct touch....But the centurion&#8217;s servant was...healed by the King&#8217;s word. The Gentile centurion believed in this word, and his servant was healed. The Jews are always saved through the King&#8217;s direct touch, but we Gentiles are saved...through believing the enlivening, regenerating word of the gospel. Hence, the centurion&#8217;s servant represents all the Gentile believers. The Lord did not commend the faith of the leper, because faith was not the outstanding characteristic there. The significant thing was the King&#8217;s touch. But with the healing of the centurion&#8217;s servant, faith is very outstanding. Hence, the Lord praised the centurion&#8217;s faith. Consequently, the servant was healed.

At that time, during the great tribulation, the Jews in the eyes of God will be &#8220;in a fever&#8221; (v. 14), &#8220;hot&#8221; in things other than God. After the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the kingly Savior will come back to this remnant of the Jews that they may be saved (Rom. 11:25-26; Zech. 12:10). Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law was healed in Peter&#8217;s house. At the end of this age all the remnant of the Jews will be saved in the house of Israel. Furthermore, they will be saved by the kingly Savior&#8217;s direct touch (v. 15), as was the Jewish leper (v. 3).</p><p>16<sup>1</sup> Many who were demon possessed and all those who were ill represent all the people on earth in the millennium. The millennium is the last dispensation of the old heaven and old earth; thus, it is considered the &#8220;evening&#8221; of the old heaven and old earth. In the millennium the power to cast out demons and heal illnesses will be manifested to the uttermost. Hence, all the demon possessed and all the sick will be healed. Such extensive power is the power of the coming age (Heb. 6:5). The casting out of demons and the healing of the sick in this age are only a foretaste of the extensive power of the coming age. The signs recorded in vv. 2-17 bear a dispensational significance and show the coming kingdom in miniature.</p><p>The order of the four incidents recorded in vv. 2-16 differs from that in Mark 1:29-2:1 and Luke 4:38-41; 5:12-14; and 7:1-10. In Mark&#8217;s record, which shows that Jesus is the Servant of God, the order is according to history. In Matthew&#8217;s record, which proves that Christ is the King of the kingdom of the heavens, the order is according to doctrine; i.e., Matthew puts certain incidents together to present a doctrine. In Luke&#8217;s record, which reveals that Jesus is the proper man to be man&#8217;s Savior, the order is according to morality. In John&#8217;s record, which testifies that Christ is the Son of God and even God Himself, the order is somewhat according to history.</p><p>17<sup>1</sup> All healings accomplished on fallen people are a result of the Lord&#8217;s redemption. On the cross He took away our infirmities, bore our diseases, and accomplished full healing for us. However, in this age the application of this divine healing power can be only a foretaste to us; in the coming age we will experience the full taste.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The temperature of the Jews today is very high in their fervency for [science, finance, education,] politics, industry, agriculture, and warfare....But in their heat and fervency they neither trust in God nor care for morality. [Nevertheless], at the Lord&#8217;s second coming, the Jews will be directly touched by His arrival and be saved.</p><p>Immediately after Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law was healed, she arose and served the Lord (v. 15). This signifies that at the Lord&#8217;s coming back, the remnant of the Jews, after being saved, will arise and serve Him in the millennium.

The way is revealed through the cases of two who came to the King. The first, [was] a scribe,...[and the second, a disciple]....The Lord seemed to be saying to the scribe, &#8220;Do you intend to follow Me? You have underestimated the price. You, a scribe, a learned one with a high rank in society, must realize that I am nothing and that I have nothing. I have even less than the birds and the foxes, for I have nowhere to lay My head.&#8221; I believe that the scribe was disappointed and that he did not follow Him. The principle of following the Lord is the same today. We must consider the price. In following this King, there is no material enjoyment.</p><p>Verse 21 says, &#8220;And another of the disciples said to Him, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.&#8221; In saying this, this disciple, who was not a scribe, overly considered the cost of following the King of the heavenly kingdom. This disciple, apparently warned by the first case, overestimated the cost. He seemed to be saying to the Lord, &#8220;I will follow You, but I have a dead father. Let me first go back to bury him, and then I will come back to follow You.&#8221;...Because this disciple overestimated the cost of following the King, He answered him in the way of encouraging him to follow Him, to drop his consideration of the cost, and to leave the burial of his father to others. The Lord said, &#8220;Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.&#8221; How wonderful the Lord Jesus is! He purposely disappointed the first and deliberately encouraged the second. The Lord was very wise in dealing with people.... Thus, He discouraged [the] person of high rank. But to the disciple who had been warned by this case not to follow the Lord in a light or loose way, the Lord...encouraged him to forget about all the preparations he was making, to leave the dead to bury the dead, and to follow Him.</p><p>By these two cases we see that it is not easy to contact people. How would you deal with these two if they came to you today? Probably you would accept both of them. However, the Lord differentiated between them, discouraging the one and encouraging the other.</p><p>In these two cases we see the way to follow the heavenly King. First, as we follow Him, we should not expect to have any material enjoyment. Second, in order to follow Him, we must ignore the requirements of the dead. The Lord told the disciple to &#8220;let the dead bury their own dead.&#8221; The first dead refers to those who are dead spiritually, as mentioned in Ephesians 2:1, 5; the second dead refers to the disciple&#8217;s father, who was dead physically. Eventually, the spiritually dead will fulfill the duty of burying the physically dead....We are the living ones and we must go on to follow the King....If you do not expect any material enjoyment and if you will leave the dead duties to the dead, you can go on to follow Him.

The fallen angels in the air and the demons in the water collaborated to frustrate the King from going to the other side of the sea because they knew He would cast out the demons there (vv. 28-32).</p><p>When the Lord Jesus had come to the country of the Gadarenes, He was met by two who were possessed by demons....The demons cried out, saying, &#8220;What do we have to do with You, Son of God? Have You come here before the time to torment us?&#8221; (v. 29). The King called Himself the Son of Man (v. 20), but the demons called Him the Son of God, tempting Him to deviate from His standing as the Son of Man....The word &#8220;Go!&#8221; [in verse 32] was the King&#8217;s authoritative order, and the demons obeyed it. The King complied with the demons&#8217; entreaty to enter into the hogs because hogs are unclean in the eyes of God (Lev. 11:7). Unable to tolerate being possessed by the demons, the hogs rushed into the sea. The demons consented because the water is their lodging place (Matt. 12:43-44).</p><p>In 9:1-8 we see the King&#8217;s authority to forgive sins. [Here] a paralytic was brought to Him....The mention of sins in verse 2 indicates that the paralytic was sick because of his sins.</p><p>&#8220;Some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes&#8221; [v. 3]. The scribes, confident that they knew the Scriptures, thought that only God had authority to forgive sins and that Jesus, who in their eyes was only a man, had blasphemed God when He said, &#8220;Your sins are forgiven.&#8221; This indicates that they did not realize that the Lord was God. By uttering such a word, they rejected the King of the heavenly kingdom. This was the first rejection by the leaders of the Jewish religion....As God, He not only has authority over the natural environment and over demons; He also has the full authority to forgive people of their sins.

After the King decreed the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens and after He manifested His authority as the King in many situations, in 9:9-13 we see Him feasting with sinners.</p><p>In 9:9 we have the calling of Matthew....Matthew was also called Levi (Mark 2:14; Luke 5:27). He was a tax collector who became an apostle by God&#8217;s grace (Matt. 10:2-3; Acts 1:13, 26). He was the writer of this Gospel....According to the record in 9:9 it seems that this was the first time the Lord met Matthew. There must have been some attracting power with the Lord, either in His word or appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him.</p><p>After being saved, Matthew was so grateful to the Lord that he opened his house and prepared a feast for Him and His disciples. Thus, this section of the Word opens in such a sweet, intimate way....While the Lord Jesus was enjoying the feast with all the tax collectors and sinners, the Pharisees criticized and condemned Him, and they asked the disciples why their teacher ate with such people [v. 11]. This question indicates that the self-righteous Pharisees did not know the grace of God. They thought that God deals with man only according to righteousness....This was a continuation of the rejection of the heavenly King, begun in verse 3, by the leaders of the Jewish religion.</p><p>In verse 12 we see the Lord&#8217;s reply to the Pharisees&#8217; question: &#8220;Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.&#8221;...In calling people to follow Him for the kingdom, the King of the heavenly kingdom ministered as a Physician, not as a Judge. A judge&#8217;s judgment is according to righteousness, whereas a physician&#8217;s healing is according to mercy and grace. Those whom He made people of His heavenly kingdom were lepers (8:2-4), paralytics (8:5-13; 9:2-8), the fever-ridden (8:14-15), the demon possessed (8:16, 28-32), those ill with all kinds of diseases (8:16), despised tax collectors, and sinners (9:9-11). If He had visited these pitiful people as a Judge, all would have been condemned and rejected, and none would have been qualified, selected, and called to be the people of His heavenly kingdom. However, He came to minister as a Physician, to heal, recover, enliven, and save them that they might be reconstituted to be His new and heavenly citizens....The Lord&#8217;s word here implies that the self-righteous Pharisees did not realize that they needed Him as a Physician. They considered themselves strong; hence, blinded by their own self-righteousness.</p><p>The self-righteous Pharisees were confident they knew all things concerning God. In order to humble them, the Lord told them to learn more [v. 13].</p><p>Mercy is part of the grace that man receives from God. But self-righteous men do not like to receive mercy or grace from God; they prefer to give something to God. This is contrary to God&#8217;s way in His economy. Just as God desires to show mercy to pitiful sinners, so He wants us to show mercy in love to others (Micah 6:6-8; Mark 12:33).

However, some of John&#8217;s disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to some of his practices, and made those practices a religion. To be religious is to do something for God, without Christ. To do anything, even if it is scriptural and fundamental, without the presence of Christ is to be religious. Both John&#8217;s disciples...and the Pharisees, who were...without Christ...made fasting a matter of religion. Meanwhile, they condemned the disciples of Christ, who did not fast but had Christ with them and lived in His presence.</p><p>In the case of the new religion, the Lord is not only the Physician but also the Bridegroom....Now Christ, the kingly Savior, reminded some of them of this. The kingly Savior first healed His followers, and then made them the sons of the bridechamber; eventually, He will make them His bride....They were with Him at a joyful wedding, not without Him at a mournful funeral. How then could they fast and not feast before Him?</p><p>In 9:16 the Lord continues with something even finer, sweeter, and more intimate....The Greek word translated unfulled...means...unfinished, unshrunk, untreated. The unfulled cloth signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion, as a piece of new cloth, untreated, unfinished; whereas the new garment in Luke 5:36 signifies Christ as a new robe after He was &#8220;treated&#8221; in His crucifixion....Christ first was the unfulled cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and be acceptable to Him (Luke 15:22; Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 1:30). A patch of unfulled cloth sewn on an old garment pulls away from the garment because of the strength of its shrinking, thus making the tear worse. To sew a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment means to imitate what Christ did in His human life on earth....The old garment in verse 16 signifies the good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices produced by man&#8217;s old, natural life.</p><p>The new wine [v. 17] signifies Christ as the new life [who] strengthens us, energizes us, and makes us very happy....Old wineskins signify religious practices, such as the fasting maintained by the Pharisees, who were of the old religion, and by the disciples of John, who were of the new religion. All religions are old wineskins. New wine put into old wineskins bursts the wineskins by the power of its fermenting....The new [fresh] wineskin is the church life...Christ enlarged....He is the Bridegroom, the new garment, the new wine, and also the corporate vessel to contain what we enjoy of Him. The meaning here is very profound.

These miracles are grouped together to present a meaningful doctrine; that is, they have a dispensational significance.</p><p>The first class of people saved by the kingly Savior is represented by a leper. The leper here represents the Jews. Leprosy in the Scriptures signifies rebellion and disobedience. The Jewish leper was healed by the King&#8217;s direct touch. In contrast, the Gentile centurion&#8217;s servant was healed by the King&#8217;s word. At the end of this age salvation will come back from the Gentiles to the Jews, not the scattered ones, but to the Jews in the house of Israel. At that time the Jews will be sick of a fever-fervent in science, in finance, in education, and in all manner of worldly pursuits. In the eyes of God all this is a fever. In their fervency they neither trust in God nor care for morality. Just as the Lord healed Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law (vv. 14-15), so will He come back again at the end of this age to heal the Jews not through their faith, but through His direct touch.</p><p>In verses 18 through 22 we see the way to follow the heavenly King. The way is revealed through the cases of two who came to the King. First, as we follow Him, we should not expect to have any material enjoyment. Second, in order to follow Him, we must ignore the requirements of the dead. Eventually, the spiritually dead will fulfill the duty of burying the physically dead (Eph. 2:1, 5).</p><p>In Matthew 8:23-9:8 we see the authority of the King which is of three aspects: over the winds and the sea, over the demons, and the authority to forgive sins. Together these cases reveal a clear picture of who this heavenly King is. He is the Savior of the Jews and also of the Gentiles. As God, He not only has authority over the natural environment and over the demons; He also has the full authority to forgive people of their sins.</p><p>After He manifested His authority as the King, in many situations, in 9:9-13 we see Him feasting with sinners. The Pharisees criticized and condemned Him. They assumed that God deals with man only according to righteousness. As the Lord was feasting with all those sick ones, He revealed Himself as the Physician to heal them, not as a Judge to condemn them.</p><p>Matthew presents us another case in 9:14-17: the case of fasting without the Bridegroom. The disciples of John the Baptist were fasting without Christ, without the Spirit. Hence, they formed another religion. Religion is doing things to please God apart from Christ and the Spirit. Now in this case the Lord Jesus likens Himself to a bridegroom at a wedding. The Lord asked if the sons of the bridechamber can mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them. It is a joyful time with the Bridegroom, but when the Bridegroom is taken away, they may fast.</p><p>Finally, we see that Christ is not only our new garment as our outward qualification and new wine as our inward energizing life, but being increased He is also our new wineskin, the church, the Body (1 Cor. 12:12), capable of holding the wine. Christ is everything.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 7 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 9:18, 20-22, 33</h2><p class="bold">18 &nbsp;...A ruler came and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live.</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;And behold, a woman, who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years approached from behind and touched the fringe of His garment,</p> <p>21 &nbsp;For she said within herself, If only I touch His garment, I will be healed.</p> <p class="bold">22 &nbsp;And Jesus, turning and seeing her, said, Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you. And the woman was healed from that hour.</p><p>33 &nbsp;And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man <sup>1</sup>spoke....</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>These verses give a brief picture of this age and the coming age. Hence, the record in this section has a dispensational significance, as did the record in 8:1-17. The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue represents the Jews, and the woman with the hemorrhage represents the Gentiles. When the daughter died, the woman was healed. After the woman was healed, the daughter was revived. Subsequently, two blind men and one dumb man were healed. This is a type, showing that when the Jews were cut off, the Gentiles were saved, and that after the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the Jews will be saved (Rom. 11:15, 17, 19, 23-26). After that, the millennium will begin, in which all the blind and dumb will be healed (Isa. 35:5-6).</p><p>As the Lord was on the way to the ruler&#8217;s house, a woman who had been sick of a hemorrhage for twelve years &#8220;approached from behind and touched the fringe of His garment.&#8221;...The woman had been sick for twelve years, the age of the ruler&#8217;s dead daughter (Luke 8:42).... The woman here and the centurion in 8:5-10, both representing the Gentiles, came to contact the Lord in the same way-with faith. The woman was healed while the Lord was on the way to the ruler&#8217;s house. This signifies that the Gentiles are saved while Christ is on the way to the house of Israel. Christ&#8217;s garment signifies His righteous deeds, and the fringe signifies the heavenly ruling....Out of Christ&#8217;s heavenly-ruled deeds issues the virtue that becomes the healing power (Matt. 14:36).</p><p>In verses 23 through 26 we have the healing of the synagogue ruler&#8217;s daughter. The daughter here and Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law in 8:14-15, both representing the Jews at the end of this age, were healed in a house by the Lord&#8217;s coming and His direct touch. This indicates that at the end of this age all the remnant of the Jews will be saved in the house of Israel by the Lord&#8217;s coming and His direct touch (Rom. 11:25-26; Zech. 12:10).</p><p>Immediately after the raising of the ruler&#8217;s daughter, two blind men and a dumb man are brought to the Lord (vv. 27-33)....These two blind men called the Lord the Son of David. In the millennial kingdom, that is, in the restored tabernacle of David (Acts 15:16), the Messianic kingdom, the Jews will recognize Christ as the Son of David, and their blindness will be healed. This is typified by the two blind men recognizing Christ as the Son of David. The two blind men were healed in the house by the Lord&#8217;s direct touch (v. 29)....The opening of [their]...eyes signifies the recovery of inward sight, by which we see God and spiritual things (Acts 9:18; 26:18; Eph. 1:18; Rev. 3:18)....In verses 32 and 33 we see the healing of the demon possessed dumb man. Dumbness caused by demon possession signifies man&#8217;s inability to speak for God (Isa. 56:10) and praise God (Isa. 35:6) because of his worshipping of dumb idols (1 Cor. 12:2). (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 353-356)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>33<sup>1</sup> The dumb man&#8217;s speaking signifies that our speaking and praising ability is recovered by our being filled with the Lord in the spirit (Eph. 5:18-19).</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 353-357; Hymns: #124</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 7 - DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 9:35-38</h2><p>35 &nbsp;And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the <sup>1</sup>gospel of the kingdom and healing <sup>2</sup>every disease and every sickness.</p><p class="bold">36 &nbsp;And seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were <sup>1</sup>harassed and cast away like <sup>2</sup>sheep not having a <sup>2</sup>shepherd.</p><p class="bold">37 &nbsp;Then He said to His disciples, The harvest is great, but the workers few;</p><p class="bold">38 &nbsp;Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>35<sup>1</sup> See note 23<sup>2</sup> in ch. 4.</p><p>35<sup>2</sup> Every disease and every sickness signifies spiritual illness.</p><p>36<sup>1</sup> In Greek harassed refers to the sheep&#8217;s being skinned by a cruel shepherd and thus suffering pain. Cast away refers to the sheep&#8217;s being abandoned by a wicked shepherd and falling into a distressed condition in which they are homeless, wandering from place to place, and helpless. The Lord Jesus&#8217; word here depicts a situation in which the pitiful Israelites were afflicted and in anguish under the hands of the chief priests and scribes, the evil shepherds.</p><p>36<sup>2</sup> This indicates that the heavenly King considered the Israelites sheep and Himself as their Shepherd. When Christ came to the Jews the first time, they were like lepers, paralytics, the demon possessed, and all manner of pitiful persons because they had no shepherd to care for them. Now in His kingly ministry for the establishing of His heavenly kingdom, He ministered to them not only as a Physician but also as a Shepherd, as prophesied in Isaiah 53:6 and 40:11.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Now we come to the enlargement of the King&#8217;s ministry (9:35-10:15). The continuation of the King&#8217;s ministry in chapter nine...enabled Him to reveal Himself...as the Shepherd and as the Lord of the harvest. The heavenly King considered the people not only sheep but also the harvest [v. 37]. The sheep needed shepherding, and the harvest needed reaping....The King of the heavenly kingdom considered Himself not only the Shepherd of the sheep but also the Lord of the harvest. His kingdom is established with things of life that can grow and multiply.</p><p>We all need to see a vision of the Lord Jesus as the Lord of the harvest. In verse 38 the Lord told us to beseech the Lord of the harvest that He may thrust out workers into His harvest. First, in His economy, God has a plan to accomplish; then there is the need for His people to beseech Him, to pray to Him, concerning it....Many times when we sense the need for workers, we sound out the call for help. But from now on, whenever you sense the need for workers, you must first pray to the Lord of the harvest, saying, &#8220;Lord, here is Your harvest. You are the Lord of the harvest. We call on You to thrust out some reapers. Lord, send more reapers into Your harvest.&#8221; Praying like this will make a difference....Whenever you pray that the Lord would send reapers into His harvest, you honor Him very much. How different this is from inviting people to help you in your work! When you do that, you do not honor Christ as the Lord of the harvest. Rather, it is a matter of your work, not of His harvest. You become the master of that work, and He is not considered as the Lord of the harvest. Therefore, we need to call on Him and say, &#8220;Lord, You are the Lord of the harvest. The work in this field is Yours, and this harvest is Your crop. We call on You for Your crop. Lord, send Your reapers.&#8221;</p><p>It is a principle in the Bible that, whenever you pray to the Lord for something, the Lord will send you to accomplish that for which you have prayed. The twelve disciples prayed for the Lord of the harvest to send out reapers, and the Lord answered their prayer by sending them out.

Now the twelve disciples (v. 1) were to be sent; thus they became the twelve apostles. In sending out the twelve apostles, the Lord arranged them in pairs....We need to be impressed with this principle. We all must be paired. None of us, especially the young people, should go anywhere by ourselves. We need another one to match us....Whenever you are burdened by the Lord to go to a certain place, do not go by yourself. Rather, go in pairs. If you do not have another one to match you, you will miss the blessing. In order to receive the blessing, you must be paired. This is not my opinion; it is the Lord&#8217;s economy. Hence, we all must learn the lesson to be paired, to be matched with others.</p><p>In 10:5-15 we have the way to spread the gospel of the kingdom to the house of Israel. In verses 5 and 6 we see that the Lord Jesus charged the twelve apostles not to go into the way of the Gentiles or into a city of the Samaritans, but only to &#8220;the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&#8221; The Samaritans were a mixture of Gentiles and Jewish blood (2 Kings 17:24; Ezra 4:10; John 4:9).</p><p>When the Lord sends us,...the authority, the presence of the Lord, and the peace follow us. This is the reason the Lord told the apostles to look for one worthy of their peace [Matt. 10:11, 13]....To receive the Lord&#8217;s sent ones, the apostles, means to receive the presence of the Lord and the peace. To reject them means to reject the presence of the Lord and the peace. It is not an insignificant matter to be sent by the Lord, for as sent ones, we become the Lord&#8217;s representatives....Wherever we go, we bring [His authority, His presence, and His peace] with us.

In 10:16-11:1 many things are brought to the surface. By seeing these things, we will be able to understand the situation in which we find ourselves today.</p><p>In verses 16 and 17 the Lord predicted the persecution that would come from Judaism upon His apostles....Even the Jewish nation had been fully taken over by God&#8217;s enemy....The Lord spoke of persecution coming from the Sanhedrin and the synagogues. The Sanhedrin was the highest council among the children of Israel. The Sanhedrin&#8217;s function was to see that the Jews followed the law of the Old Testament. The synagogue was a place where the Word of God was taught to the children of Israel. It is very significant that the Lord exposed the Sanhedrin and the synagogues as being opposed to God&#8217;s economy. He said that His apostles, His sent ones, would be delivered up to sanhedrins and scourged in the synagogues. A synagogue...in a sense...was a holy place, a place where the holy Word of God was taught to God&#8217;s people....By this we see what an evil thing the synagogue had become....In our experience throughout the years, nearly all the persecution, rumors, opposition, and attack have come from the religious organizations, not from the Gentiles.</p><p>The apostles have not only the authority of the heavenly King (v. 1) but also the Spirit of their Father [v. 20]. The King&#8217;s authority deals with the unclean spirits and diseases; the Father&#8217;s Spirit deals with the opposers&#8217; persecution....As long as we have the Spirit of the Lord, we have the presence of the Lord. The presence of the Lord is the Spirit for speaking. We should learn to face persecution not in ourselves, but learn to turn to our spirit and trust in the indwelling Spirit.</p><p>Those who would be the heavenly King&#8217;s apostles for the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom must suffer the breaking of the closest human ties [v. 21].</p><p>In verse 24...according to the context, the word here means that in suffering persecution His apostles cannot be above Him, because He was persecuted to the uttermost. Verse 25 says, &#8220;It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of His household!&#8221; Beelzebub meaning the lord of the flies, was the name of the god of the Ekronites (2 Kings 1:2). It was changed contemptuously by the Jews to Beelzebul, which means the lord of the dunghill, and was used for the ruler of the demons (12:24, 27; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15, 18-19). In 9:34 the Pharisees, the leading ones of the Jewish religion, reviled the heavenly King by saying that He cast out demons by the ruler of demons. In using this most blasphemous name, they expressed their strongest objection and rejection.

In verse 37 the Lord said, &#8220;He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me.&#8221; Our love for the Lord must be absolute. We should love nothing above Him.</p><p>Verse 38 continues, &#8220;And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.&#8221; Christ took the Father&#8217;s will and was crucified (26:39, 42). When He was baptized, He was counted as crucified, and from that time He bore His cross to do the will of God....He asked [His called ones] to take their cross and follow after Him, that is, to take the will of God by putting themselves aside. This demanded that at any cost they first give their love to Him that they might be worthy of Him.</p><p>Verse 39 says, &#8220;He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.&#8221; To find the soul-life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and to escape suffering. To lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to lose its enjoyment and thereby to suffer. If the heavenly King&#8217;s followers allow their soul to have its enjoyment in this age, they will cause their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age. If they allow their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the King&#8217;s sake, they will enable their soul to have its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age, that is, to share the King&#8217;s joy in ruling over the earth (25:21, 23).</p><p>In 10:40-11:1 we have the matter of the heavenly King&#8217;s identification with the sent ones. Verse 40 says, &#8220;He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who has sent Me.&#8221; The apostles sent by the heavenly King, having been entrusted with His authority (v. 1) and peace (v. 13) and having been indwelt by the Spirit of the Father (v. 20) and identified with the King in His suffering (vv. 22, 24-25) and death (vv. 21, 34-39), were one with Him. Thus, he who received them received Him. To participate in such an identification with the heavenly King requires us to love Him above all, at any cost, and to follow Him by taking the narrow way of the cross, as revealed in verses 37 through 39. Not only do the sent ones have the King&#8217;s authority and peace and the Spirit of the Father, but they are also one with the King and are identified with Him....All this is for the spreading of the King&#8217;s ministry.

After that, John was put into prison (Matt. 4:12), where he waited, expecting that Christ would do something to deliver him. However, Christ did nothing for him, although He did much to help others. When John heard of this it might have been that he was about to be stumbled (v. 6). Hence, he sent his disciples with such a question to provoke Christ.</p><p>In...the Lord&#8217;s answer to John...[He] mentioned the blind&#8217;s receiving of sight, because there had been no such miracle in the Old Testament. By this He gave clear evidence to John that none other than the Messiah could have done such a miracle (Isa. 35:5). In the spiritual sense also, the blind&#8217;s receiving of sight comes first. In the Lord&#8217;s salvation, first He opens our eyes (Acts 26:18); then we can receive Him and walk to follow Him. The lame signify those who cannot walk in God&#8217;s way. After being saved, they can walk by new life (9:5-6; John 5:8-9). The cleansed lepers signify those who have been saved from their rebellion (leprosy) to become the kingdom people. The deaf signify those who cannot hear God. After being saved, they can hear the Lord&#8217;s voice (John 10:27). The dead signify those who are dead in sins (Eph. 2:1, 5), unable to contact God. After being regenerated, they can fellowship with God by means of their regenerated spirit. The poor signify all who are without Christ and without God and who have no hope in the world (Eph. 2:12). Upon receiving the gospel, they are made rich in Christ (2 Cor. 8:9; Eph. 3:8). [Matthew 11:6] implies that John the Baptist might have been stumbled...because the Lord did not act on his behalf according to his way....In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we need to learn this lesson. Whenever the Lord does something positive for us, we are excited. But many times the Lord will not do anything for us. The reason He did nothing to rescue John from prison was that if John had been released from prison his ministry would have been in competition with the Lord&#8217;s ministry.

All the prophets prior to John prophesied only that Christ was coming, but John testified that Christ had come. The prophets were looking forward to Christ, but John saw Christ. Hence, John was greater than all the prophets. Although John saw the incarnated Christ and introduced Him to people, he did not have the resurrected Christ indwelling him. The kingdom people do. John could say only, &#8220;Here is Christ,&#8221; but the kingdom people can say, &#8220;To me, to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21). Hence, the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he. Whether a person is greater or lesser depends on his relationship to Christ. Christ is the deciding factor.

After the woman was healed, the daughter was revived. Following this, two blind men and one dumb man were healed. This is a type, showing that when the Jews are cut off, the Gentiles are saved and that after the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the Jews will be saved (Rom. 11:15, 17, 19, 23-26). Following this, the millennium will begin, and at that time all the blind and dumb will be healed (Isa. 35:5-6).</p><p>The Lord is revealed as the Shepherd and as the Lord of the harvest in Matthew 9:35-38.

Those sent by the heavenly King shall be opposed by today&#8217;s religious organizations just as Judaism opposed the apostles.

When John the Baptist was conceived, it was said that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:17). Hence, in a sense, John may be considered &#8220;Elijah, who is to come&#8221; (cf. Matt. 17:10-13). However, the prophecy of Malachi 4:5 will actually be fulfilled during the great tribulation, when the real Elijah, one of the two witnesses, will come to strengthen God&#8217;s people (Rev. 11:3-12).</p><p>After the Lord appraised John, He turned to the rejecting generation and reproached them. His appraisal reminded them that John had been rejected.

In this verse some authorities read &#8220;children&#8221; instead of &#8220;works.&#8221; The kingdom people are the children of wisdom, who justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom.

The main point in this chapter is how we should face rejection.</p><p>Verse 25 opens with the words, &#8220;At that time.&#8221; This refers to the time the Lord was rebuking the cities. Verse 25 says, &#8220;At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth.&#8221; When the Lord was rebuking those leading cities, He answered and said, &#8220;I extol You, Father.&#8221; The word &#8220;answered&#8221; is very meaningful. Whom did the Lord answer? He answered the Father. While the Lord was rebuking the cities, He fellowshipped with the Father.</p><p>As the Lord was rebuking the cities, a third party was present. The Lord was the first party, the cities were the second party, and the Father, who was with Him, was the third party. As the Lord was rebuking Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, the Father might have...said to the Son, &#8220;You are rebuking these cities because they have rejected You. Do You feel good about this?&#8221; The Lord immediately answered and extolled the Father, the Lord of heaven and of earth....The Greek word rendered &#8220;extol&#8221; in verse 25 means to acknowledge with extolment. The Lord acknowledged with extolment the Father&#8217;s way in carrying out His economy. Although people, instead of responding to His ministry, slandered Him (vv. 16-19), and the leading cities rejected Him (vv. 20-24), He extolled the Father, acknowledging the Father&#8217;s will. He did not seek prosperity in His work but sought the Father&#8217;s will; His satisfaction and rest were not in being understood and welcomed by man but in being known by the Father (vv. 26-27). Christ believed that the cities&#8217; rejection of Him was of the Father. What about our situation today? When we are rejected, opposed, criticized, attacked, and condemned, could we extol the Father?</p><p>In the Lord&#8217;s extolling address, &#8220;Father&#8221; refers to the Father&#8217;s relationship with Him, the Son, whereas &#8220;Lord of heaven and of earth&#8221; refers to God&#8217;s relationship with the universe. When God&#8217;s people were defeated by His enemy, God was called &#8220;the God of heaven&#8221; (Ezra 5:11-12; Dan. 2:18, 37). But when there was a man standing for Him on the earth, God was called &#8220;the Possessor of heaven and earth&#8221; (Gen. 14:19, 22).</p><p>In verse 28 the Lord [called all the toiling and burdened people to Himself to receive rest]. What a gracious word!...In verses 29 and 30 we have the way to rest....To take the Lord&#8217;s yoke is to take the will of the Father. It is not to be regulated or controlled by any obligation of the law or religion or to be enslaved by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father. The Lord lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38). He submitted Himself fully to the Father&#8217;s will (26:39, 42)....In verse 29 the Lord tells us to learn from Him. He is meek and lowly in heart. To be meek, or gentle, means not to resist any opposition, and to be lowly means not to esteem oneself highly. Throughout all the opposition the Lord was meek, and throughout all the rejection He was lowly in heart. He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself.

The Sabbath was ordained so that the Jews would remember the completion of God&#8217;s creation (Gen. 2:2), keep the sign of God&#8217;s covenant made with them (Ezek. 20:12), and remember God&#8217;s redemption accomplished for them (Deut. 5:15). Hence, to profane the Sabbath was a serious matter in the eyes of the religious Pharisees....But they did not have adequate knowledge of the Scriptures.</p><p>The Lord&#8217;s word [Matt. 12:3-4] implies that He is the real David. In the ancient time David and his followers, when rejected, entered into the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, seemingly breaking the Levitical law....Just as David and his followers were not held guilty, so Christ and His disciples should not have been condemned.</p><p>Furthermore, the Lord&#8217;s word here also implies the dispensational change from the priesthood to the kingship. In the ancient time the coming of David changed the dispensation from the age of the priests to the age of the kings, in which the kings were above the priests. In the age of the priests the leader of the people had to listen to the priest (Num. 27:21-22). But in the age of the kings the priest had to submit to the king (1 Sam. 2:35-36). Hence, what King David did with his followers was not illegal. Now the coming of Christ changed the dispensation again, this time from the age of the law to the age of grace, in which Christ is above all. Whatever He does is right.</p><p>The Lord revealed to the Pharisees that He was greater than the temple. This indicated another turn, a type-fulfilling turn from the temple to a person. In the case of David there was a turn from one age to another. In this case, a case concerning the priests, there was a turn from the temple to a person who is greater than the temple. Since the priests were guiltless in acting on the Sabbath in the temple, how could the Lord&#8217;s disciples be guilty in acting on the Sabbath in Him who is greater than the temple? In the first case the king broke the Levitical regulation; in the second case the priests broke the sabbatical regulation. According to the Scriptures neither was guilty. Hence, scripturally, what the Lord did here was right.</p><p>In verse 8 the Lord indicated the third turn, a right- asserting change from the Sabbath to the Lord of the Sabbath. As the Lord of the Sabbath, He had the right to change the regulations concerning the Sabbath. Thus, the Lord gave the condemning Pharisees a threefold verdict. He was the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath. Therefore, He could do whatever He liked on the Sabbath, and whatever He did was justified by Himself. He was above all rituals and regulations. Since He was there, no attention should have been paid to any ritual and regulation.

This took place on another Sabbath day (Luke 6:6)....In the synagogue was a man with a withered hand. When the Pharisees inquired of the Lord whether it was lawful to heal on the Sabbath, He said to them, &#8220;What man will there be among you who will have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! So then it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath&#8221; (vv. 11-12). [Following this], the Lord gave the man the word, &#8220;Stretch out your hand.&#8221; In the Lord&#8217;s word was the enlivening life. By stretching out his hand,...his withered hand was restored by the life in this word.</p><p>Leading the disciples into the grainfields [v. 1] indicates that the Lord cares for Himself as the Head of the Body. As the Head, He is everything-the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath. Restoring the withered hand signifies that He cares for His members. He healed a man&#8217;s withered hand, likening this man to a sheep. The hand is a member of the body, and the sheep is a member of the flock. The Lord would do anything for the healing of His members, for the rescue of His fallen sheep....He does not care for the Sabbath. He cares only for His headship and for the members of His Body.</p><p>In the eyes of the religious Pharisees, for the Lord to break the Sabbath was to destroy God&#8217;s covenant with the nation of Israel, that is, to destroy the relationship between God and Israel. Hence, they took counsel against Him, as to how they might destroy Him....They were absolutely blinded, veiled, covered, by their religion....At this point, 12:14, the rejection of Christ by religion reaches its peak.</p><p>[Verse 18] indicates clearly that because of the Jew&#8217;s rejection, the heavenly King with His heavenly kingdom would turn to the Gentiles, and the Gentiles would receive Him and trust in Him (v. 21).</p><p>While He was being rejected and opposed, He was still full of mercy [v. 20]. The Jews were accustomed to making flutes of reeds. When a reed was bruised, they broke it. Also they made torches out of flax, which can burn oil. When the oil ran out, the flax smoked, and they quenched it. Some of the Lord&#8217;s people are like the bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound; others are like the smoking flax that cannot give a shining light. Yet the Lord will not break the bruised ones or quench the smoking ones.</p><p>This portion of the Word reveals that, on the one hand, the Lord is bold and that, on the other hand, He is merciful....Do not think that in chapter twelve the Lord was defeated....He was not defeated; He was establishing His kingdom....This is the way the kingdom of the heavens is built.

This fighting is implied in 12:22-37.</p><p>Although the crowds were amazed [at the Lord&#8217;s healing of the blind and dumb man], the Pharisees were offended, unable to tolerate the fact that through an extraordinary miracle the Lord Jesus had gained all the crowds. Hence, these Pharisees had to say something to deal with the situation. According to verse 24, they said, &#8220;This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons.&#8221; This was the greatest blasphemy heaped upon the heavenly King by the opposing Pharisees.</p><p>The Lord seemed to be saying to the Pharisees [vv. 25-26], &#8220;How could I cast out a demon by Satan? If I did this, then Satan would be fighting against Satan, and his kingdom could not stand.&#8221; Verse 26 is unique in the whole Bible in that no other verse opens the secret that Satan has his kingdom. Satan is the ruler of this world (John 12:31) and the ruler of the authority of the air (Eph. 2:2). He has his authority (Acts 26:18) and his angels (Matt. 25:41), who are his subordinates as rulers, authorities, and worldrulers of the darkness of this world (Eph. 6:12). Hence, he has his kingdom, the authority of darkness (Col. 1:13).</p><p>The Spirit of God is the power of the kingdom of God [v. 28]. Where the Spirit of God is in power, there the kingdom of God is, and there the demons have no ground. By the Lord&#8217;s word here we see that the battle fought for the kingdom is not fought by just a man himself, but by a man with the Spirit of God.</p><p>Verse 29 reveals that before the Lord cast out the demon, He firstly fought against Satan....The &#8220;house&#8221; here signifies the kingdom of Satan, and &#8220;the strong man&#8221; is Satan, the evil one. The Greek word translated &#8220;vessels&#8221; also means instruments, apparatus; hence, goods, stuff. The fallen people, who are under Satan are his vessels, his instruments, and are for his use. They are his goods, kept in his house, his kingdom. The word about binding the strong man indicates that when the Lord cast out demons, He first bound Satan....The way to bind the strong man is to pray....The Lord&#8217;s word [in 17:21] to His disciples indicates that before He cast out a demon, He surely fasted and prayed. In order to bind the strong man, we must fast and pray. The Lord fasted and prayed secretly. The disciples did not see this. We must learn of the Lord to fast in secret and to pray in secret....We all must be in the same spirit today. Every day our spirit must be a fasting spirit and a praying spirit so that we may daily bind the strong man, who is Satan, the king of the kingdom of darkness.

To insult the Spirit is to disobey Him willfully. Many believers do this. If they confess this sin, they will be forgiven and cleansed by the Lord&#8217;s blood (1 John 1:7, 9). But to blaspheme the Spirit is to slander Him....[According to verse 32, speaking against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven in this age or in the one to come.]...In the economy of the Triune God, the Father conceived the plan of redemption (Eph. 1:5, 9), the Son accomplished redemption according to the Father&#8217;s plan (1 Pet. 2:24; Gal. 1:4), and the Spirit reaches sinners to apply the redemption accomplished by the Son (1 Cor. 6:11; 1 Pet. 1:2). If a sinner blasphemes the Son as Saul of Tarsus did, the Spirit will still have the ground to work on him and cause him to repent and believe in the Son that he may be forgiven (see 1 Tim. 1:13-16). But if a sinner blasphemes the Spirit, the Spirit will have no ground to work on him, and there will be no one left to cause him to repent and believe. Hence, it is impossible for such a person to be forgiven. This is not only logical according to reason but also governmental according to God&#8217;s administrative principle, as revealed here by the Lord&#8217;s word.</p><p>In God&#8217;s governmental administration His forgiveness is dispensational. For His administration He has planned different ages. The period from the first coming of Christ to eternity is divided dispensationally into three ages: (1) this age, the present one, from Christ&#8217;s first coming to His second coming; (2) the coming age, the millennium, the one thousand years for restoration and heavenly reigning, from Christ&#8217;s second coming to the end of the old heaven and old earth; and (3) eternity, the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth. God&#8217;s forgiveness in this age is for sinners&#8217; eternal salvation. This forgiveness is given to both sinners and believers. God&#8217;s forgiveness in the coming age is related to the believers&#8217; dispensational reward. If after being saved a believer commits a sin but will not make a clearance through confession and the cleansing of the Lord&#8217;s blood (1 John 1:7, 9) before he dies or the Lord comes back, the sin will not be forgiven in this age but will remain to be judged at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). In such a case, the believer will not be rewarded with the kingdom [to] participate with Christ in the glory and joy  in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, but will be disciplined so that the sin is cleared, and will be forgiven in the coming age (Matt. 18:23-35). This kind of forgiveness will maintain this believer&#8217;s eternal salvation but will not qualify him to participate in the glory and joy of the coming kingdom.</p><p>An idle word [mentioned by the Lord in verse 36] is a non-working word, an inoperative word, a word that has no positive function and is useless, unprofitable, unfruitful, and barren. In the day of judgment, those who speak such words will render account concerning every one of them.</p><p>In verse 37 the Lord concludes, &#8220;For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.&#8221; What a warning this is! We must learn to control and restrict our speaking.

Verse 13 proves that the coming of John the Baptist terminated the Old Testament dispensation.</p><p>In chapter eleven we see how the King deals with rejection and how we should face rejection. As the Lord was rebuking the unrepentant cities (vv. 20-24), He fellowshipped with the Father (v. 25). At such a time He could say, &#8220;I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth...&#8221; (see vv. 25-27). I recognize Your authority. If this were not of You, none of these cities would reject Me. Even their rejection is of You. Furthermore, the Lord called the burdened to rest and revealed the way to rest in verses 28 through 30. The way is by taking the heavenly King&#8217;s yoke and learning from Him. His yoke is the Father&#8217;s will. To learn from Him is to be meek and lowly in heart. To be meek means not to resist any opposition, and to be lowly means not to esteem oneself highly.</p><p>Matthew chapter twelve reveals the establishment of the King&#8217;s rejection. The reason for the rejection of the Lord was the breaking of the Sabbath (vv. 1-14). The Lord Jesus took the lead not to keep the Sabbath regulations by bringing His disciples out of a regulation-keeping situation into the grainfields where they all found something to eat. This environment afforded the Lord Jesus the opportunity to unveil Himself as the real David (vv. 3-4), the greater temple (vv. 5-6), and the Lord of the Sabbath (v. 8).</p><p>The establishment of the King&#8217;s rejection is continued in verses 9 through 14 with His kingly salvation to turn from the Jews to the Gentiles (12:15-21). While He was being rejected and opposed, He was still full of mercy. The Jews who were opposing Him were like bruised reeds and smoking flax. Likewise, today many of His followers have become bruised reeds that can no longer give a musical song and many no longer burn as a bright light. Christ would not break and throw away the bruised reeds nor quench the smoking flax. Rather, He would wait for you to receive His mercy and grace.</p><p>In order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there is the need of a spiritual battle. This fighting is implied in 12:22-37 where the Lord healed a demon possessed man. The Pharisees said that He cast out the demons by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons. If the Lord had done this, then Satan would be fighting against Satan, and his kingdom could not stand. Satan&#8217;s house is his kingdom, and in his house are many vessels, the many fallen persons. In order to take a fallen person out of Satan&#8217;s house, we must bind the strong man by prayer and fasting.</p><p>According to verse 36, &#8220;Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.&#8221; The Lord seemed to be telling the opposers, &#8220;Be careful with your speaking. There will be a day of judgment, and whatever you say will be judged at that time.&#8221; We must learn to control and restrict our speaking!</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 9 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 12:38-42</h2><p>38 &nbsp;Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.</p> <p>39 &nbsp;But He answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.</p><p class="bold">40 &nbsp;For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</p><p class="bold">41 &nbsp;Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something <sup>1</sup>more than Jonah is here.</p><p class="bold">42 &nbsp;The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The Lord Jesus proceeded to tell [the Pharisees] the significance of the sign of Jonah. In verse 40 He said, &#8220;For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.&#8221; This was to be a very meaningful sign to them. The heart of the earth is called &#8220;the lower parts of the earth&#8221; (Eph. 4:9) and Hades (Acts 2:27), where the Lord went after His death. Hades, equal to Sheol in the Old Testament, has two sections, the section of torment and the section of comfort (Luke 16:23-26). The section of comfort is Paradise, where the Lord went with the saved thief after they died on the cross (Luke 23:43). Hence, heart of the earth, lower parts of the earth, Hades, and Paradise are synonymous terms, referring to the place where the Lord stayed for three days and three nights after His death and before His resurrection.</p><p>In the Lord&#8217;s conversation with the Pharisees, suddenly another sign appeared: the sign of Solomon [v. 42]. Christ, as the Son of David, as the King, is more than Solomon the king. Solomon built the temple of God and spoke the word of wisdom, and to him the Gentile queen came (1 Kings 6:2; 10:1-8). This too was a type of Christ, who is building the church, making it the temple of God, and is speaking the word of wisdom. To Him the Gentile seekers turn. This type, and that in verse 41, indicate that Christ, whether as the Prophet sent by God or as the King anointed by God, would turn from Israel to the Gentiles, as prophesied in verses 18 and 21. According to history King Solomon preceded Jonah the prophet. But according to spiritual significance, Jonah came first, as recorded in Matthew. This too shows that Matthew&#8217;s record is not according to the sequence of history but according to the sequence of doctrine. According to doctrine, first Christ had to die and be resurrected; then He would build the church and speak the word of wisdom. Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection are the real sign to this generation, to both the Jews and the Gentiles (1 Cor. 1:22, 24). (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 418-420)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>41<sup>1</sup> The Greek word for more, occurring also in v. 42, means better in quality and larger in quantity; hence, more....Christ, as the Prophet sent by God to His people (Deut. 18:15, 18), is more than Jonah the prophet. Jonah was the prophet who turned from Israel to the Gentiles and was put into the belly of the great fish. After remaining there for three days, he came out to become a sign to that generation for repentance (Jonah 1:2, 17; 3:2-10). This was a type of Christ, who would turn from Israel to the Gentiles and who would be buried in the heart of the earth for three days and then be resurrected, becoming a sign to this generation for salvation.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 417-421; Hymns: #193 (vv. 1-2, 7)</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 9 - DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 12:43-45, 48, 50</h2><p>43 &nbsp;When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, it roams through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it.</p> <p>44 &nbsp;Then it says, I will return to my house from which I came out.

(See Life-study of Genesis, Message Two.) Since a demon cannot find rest in dry places, it returns into the human body that it originally possessed and settles down there (vv. 44-45).</p><p>Doctrinally, verse 43 continues verse 22. Between these two verses is a record of the Jews&#8217; rejection of Christ and of Christ&#8217;s forsaking of them. Here the Lord likened the evil generation of the rejecting Jews to the demon possessed man. In the eyes of the Lord the rejecting Jews were like demon possessed people. The signs of Jonah and Solomon indicated that the Gentiles would repent, but the case of the demon-possessed man indicated that the rejecting Jews would not repent. They would only sweep away the dirt and decorate by adding good things to beautify themselves. They would not receive Christ and allow Him to fill them. Rather, they would remain empty and unoccupied.</p><p>The Lord describes this house [v. 44] with three words: unoccupied, swept, and decorated. This word was also a prophecy, a prophecy that has been fulfilled and yet is still to be fulfilled....The entire nation of Israel today has been cleansed [swept], and so many things have been cast out. Furthermore, they have been decorated with various good things; the Jewish people excel in science and other areas. However, the nation of Israel remains unoccupied.</p><p>I love Israel, but I must speak according to God&#8217;s revelation....When the demon realized that the person was unoccupied, it took seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all came to occupy the vacancy. This indicates that year by year the nation of Israel will become more and more devilish. More and more demonic things will be found there. The Jews are like a clean house, but they will not accept Christ and receive Him into them. Rather, they remain unoccupied....The nation of Israel today has no goal; hence, it is unoccupied.</p><p>After this, as the Lord Jesus was speaking to the crowds, His mother and His brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to Him....The Lord said, &#8220;Who is My mother, and who are My brothers? And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, Behold, My mother and My brothers! For whoever does the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother&#8221; (vv. 48-50)....Whoever does the will of His Father is a brother who helps Him, a sister who sympathizes with Him, and a mother who tenderly loves Him....In verses 46 through 50 we see a great turn, even a dispensational turn....Thus, Romans 11 says that Israel was cut off, [and] that the Gentiles have been grafted in.

When I read this verse as a young man, it meant nothing to me. But now I realize that this verse is very meaningful. At the end of chapter twelve, the heavenly King, having been fully rejected by the leaders of the Jewish religion, made a break with them. On that day He went out of the house and sat beside the sea. This is very significant. The house signifies the house of Israel (10:6), and the sea signifies the Gentile world (Dan. 7:3, 17; Rev. 17:15). The King&#8217;s going out of the house to sit beside the sea signifies that after His break with the Jews, He forsook the house of Israel and turned to the Gentiles. It was after this, while on the seashore, that He gave the parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom. This signifies that the mysteries of the kingdom were revealed in the church. Hence, all the parables in this chapter were spoken to His disciples, not to the Jews.</p><p>Verse 2 says that great crowds were gathered to Him. But this does not mean that all those in these great crowds became His relatives. Verse 2 also says, &#8220;He stepped into a boat and sat, and all the crowd stood on the shore.&#8221; The boat, which was in the sea but not of the sea, signifies the church, which is in the world but not of the world.</p><p>Verse 3 says, &#8220;And He spoke many things to them in parables.&#8221; He spoke these parables in the boat on the sea. Do you want to know the mysteries of the kingdom? [v. 11]. If you do, then you must leave the house and not stand on the seashore, but get into the boat close to the Lord. This is the only place where we can understand the mysteries of the kingdom.</p><p>Before we consider the parables in Matthew 13, I would like to impress you with some of the warnings found in this chapter....The King of the heavenly kingdom used parables to reveal the things of the kingdom (v. 34) in order to make them mysteries to the opposing and rejecting Jews so that they would not understand them. From the time the King came to sow the seed until He comes back to reap the harvest, everything concerning the kingdom is a mystery to the natural mind. Only the enlightened mind of a submissive heart can understand these mysteries.</p><p>In verse 12...the words whoever has refer to the receiver and follower of the heavenly King; to such a one the revelation concerning the kingdom will be given in abundance. But the one who does not have is the opposing and rejecting Jew, from whom what the heavenly King has spoken and done will be taken away.</p><p>The reason those in that stubborn generation could not understand lay in their heart, which had become fat [v. 15]. Fat signifies the pride of having something....That was the actual situation of the Pharisees. Because their heart had become fat, their eyes and ears were affected. They could see, but not perceive; they could hear, but not understand.

In contrast to what He said in the other six parables (vv. 24, 31, 33, 44-45, 47), at the beginning of this parable, the first of the seven parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom, the Lord did not say, &#8220;The kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like...,&#8221; because the kingdom of the heavens began with the second parable. In the first parable, the Lord went out only to sow the seed for the kingdom. At that time the seed had not yet grown to be the crop for the formation of the kingdom. As the Lord said in His preaching at that time, the kingdom had not yet come but had only drawn near (4:17)....The sower in verse 3 is the Lord Himself (v. 37). Actually, the Lord did not come to teach, but to sow the seed. What is this seed? It is the word of the kingdom with the Lord being in this word as life (v. 19). The seed is also the sons, the people, of the kingdom (v. 38). If we check with our experience, we will realize that the seed sown by the Lord Jesus into our humanity is just Himself as life to make us the seed of the kingdom. Here three things are interrelated: the word of the kingdom, the sons of the kingdom, and Christ Himself as the life within the seed. These three cannot be separated.</p><p>Verse 4 says, &#8220;And as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the way, and the birds came and devoured them.&#8221; Beside the way refers to a place close to the way. It is hardened by the traffic of the way; thus, it is difficult for the seeds to penetrate it. The wayside signifies the heart that is hardened by worldly traffic and cannot open to understand, to comprehend, the word of the kingdom (v. 19). The birds signify the evil one, Satan, who comes and snatches away the word of the kingdom sown in the hardened heart.</p><p>The rocky places [vv. 5-6] that do not have much earth signify the heart that is shallow in receiving the word of the kingdom. Deep within such a heart are rocks-hidden sins, personal desires, self-seeking, and self-pity-which hinder the seed from taking root in the depths of the heart. The sun with its scorching heat signifies affliction or persecution (v. 21). The scorching heat of the sun causes the seed that is not rooted to wither. The heat of the sun is for the growth and ripening of the crop, which take place once the seed has been deeply rooted. But because of the seed&#8217;s lack of root, the sun&#8217;s heat, which should cause growth and ripening, becomes a death blow to the seed.</p><p>Verse 7 says, &#8220;And others fell on the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.&#8221; The thorns signify the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches, which utterly choke the word, preventing it from growing in the heart and causing it to become unfruitful.</p><p>The good earth [in verse 8] signifies the good heart that is not hardened by worldly traffic, that is without hidden sins, and that is without the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches. Such a heart gives every inch of its ground to receive the word that the word may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold (v. 23).

But the church can be produced only by sowing Christ as the seed into humanity....If we see this vision, we would no longer trust in what we do because we would know that the kingdom is a matter of life, that the church is a matter of growth in the life seed sown into our humanity....Those who have been with us for a number of years can testify that I do not teach others what they should do. I do not give them instructions regarding their behavior.

Young people, if you go to the campuses to do a work, that will mean nothing. You should not go there to work, but to sow the seed, to be a sower.

She was in China sowing Christ, even sowing herself in Christ. She was a seed sown into that district in China. Eventually, something grew out of that seed. The Lord&#8217;s recovery today is the produce of the seed sown by Sister Barber and Brother Nee.</p><p>According to this parable and the Lord&#8217;s own interpretation of it, this seed is sown into our heart (v. 19). In the past we have pointed out that our heart is not the receiving organ but the loving organ, and that our receiving organ is our spirit. We say this based upon Ezekiel 36, where God promises to give us a new spirit and a new heart, a new spirit to receive God and a new heart to love Him....In 1 Peter 3:4 our spirit is called the inner man of our heart. This indicates that our spirit is surrounded by our heart.... When we believed in the Lord Jesus...we opened our heart. The result, however, was that He came into our spirit. When we opened our heart to believe in Him, He came into our spirit. But our spirit is not the soil for growing Christ. The soil is our heart. This parable makes it perfectly clear that our heart is...the earth, the very place where the seed is sown and where it grows.</p><p>The parable of the sower seems very simple, but it is actually deep and profound. It exposes the real condition of our heart in the presence of the heavenly King.

It was from that time, after the church had been founded, that the tares, the false believers, were sown among the true believers, the wheat, forming the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>[In] verse 25...the men were the slaves (v. 27), referring to the Lord&#8217;s slaves, mainly the apostles. It was when the Lord&#8217;s slaves were sleeping and were not watching that the Lord&#8217;s enemy, the devil, came and sowed false believers among the true.</p><p>A tare is a kind of darnel, a weed resembling wheat. Its seeds are poisonous and can cause sleepiness, nausea, convulsions, and even death. The sprout and leaves of tares look the same as those of wheat. It is impossible to distinguish wheat from tares until the fruit is produced. The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow, but that of the tares is black.</p><p>When the King&#8217;s slaves wanted to collect the tares (v. 28), He said, &#8220;No, lest while collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them.&#8221; Both the tares and the wheat grow in the field, and the field is the world (v. 38). The false believers and the true live in the world. To collect the tares from the field means to take away the false believers from the world. The Lord did not want His slaves to do this, because while taking away the false believers from the world, they might also take the true ones away. The Catholic Church did this very much and by so doing killed many true believers.</p><p>Many Christian teachers have wrongly interpreted the field, saying that it is the church. According to this interpretation, in the church there are both false ones and real ones. But the Lord says clearly in verse 38 that the field is the world. The wheat and the tares are allowed to grow together in the world, not in the church. According to the Epistles, not even sinful ones are allowed to remain in the church....If even the real but sinful ones must be cast out [1 Cor. 5], then how much more the false ones? The church is not to tolerate the false believers, but both the false and the true are allowed to grow together in the world.</p><p>In Galatians 2:4 and 2 Corinthians 11:26 Paul mentioned false brothers, saying that he was damaged by the false brothers. This indicates that in Paul&#8217;s time the tares were present. Of course, a great many more tares have come in since Constantine made Christianity the state religion.</p><p>In this parable the Lord points out the serious matter of the judgment upon the tares [vv. 30, 40-42]. This will be a special judgment, for the tares will be bound into bundles and cast into the furnace of fire, which is the lake of fire....The judgment upon the tares will be so serious because they have been confusing, frustrating, and damaging God&#8217;s economy.

The sign for the evil and adulterous generation was the sign of Jonah. The Lord followed this sign with the sign of Solomon. By His word in verses 40 through 42 the Lord prophesied fully concerning His death, burial, and resurrection. Jonah was a type of Christ in His death and burial, and Solomon was a type of Christ in His resurrection. His death and resurrection were to be the unique sign to this age and to that generation.</p><p>Matthew 12:43-45 reveals the rejecting generation becoming worse. Here the Lord likened them to the demon possessed man out from whom a demon had gone. That person was like a vacant house which the Lord described with three words: unoccupied, swept, and decorated. When the demon realized that the person was unoccupied, it took seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all came to occupy the vacancy. This indicates that the Jews will not accept Christ, and their situation will become worse and worse. The Jews&#8217; rejection of Christ in this chapter caused Christ to forsake them fully. Thus, in verses 46 through 50 we see a dispensational turn. After that, His relationship with people was based upon something spiritual. All those who do the will of the Father are His relatives.</p><p>The heavenly King went out of the house and gave the parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom beside the sea. The house signifies the house of Israel (10:6), and the sea signifies the Gentile world (Dan. 7:3, 17; Rev. 17:15). All the parables were mysteries to that stubborn Jewish generation simply because of their pride (Matt. 13:14-15).</p><p>In the first parable, that of the sower (13:3-8), Christ establishes the kingdom of the heavens by sowing Himself as the seed of life into believing people. The kingdom is not established by outward working but by inward growing. The Lord&#8217;s recovery today is the produce of the seed sown by Sister M. E. Barber and Brother Watchman Nee.</p><p>This parable makes it clear that our heart is the soil (v. 19), the earth, the very place where the seed is sown and where it grows. The first type of soil, the wayside-because of much worldly traffic-corresponds to those who are not poor in spirit and pure in heart. The second, the rocky places, corresponds to those who still have their temper, lust, sin, self, and flesh beneath the surface. Instead of depth, there are rocks. The third type of soil, the thorns, is difficult for the seed to grow in because of anxiety and the deceitfulness of riches. The fourth type of soil, the good heart, is the soil that can grow the kingdom.</p><p>The kingdom of the heavens began with the second parable (13:24-30, 36-43) and began to be established when the church was built (16:18-19) on the day of Pentecost. From that time, the tares, the false believers, were sown among the true believers, the wheat, forming the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. The wheat and the tares are allowed to grow together in the world, not in the church (1 Cor. 5:2, 13). At the time of the harvest, the judgment upon the tares will be so serious because they have been confusing, frustrating, and damaging God&#8217;s economy.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 10 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 13:36-40, 43</h2><p class="bold">36 &nbsp;Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house.

He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>This parable discloses that not long after the kingdom was established...with the sons of the kingdom, the wheat, that the sons of the evil one, the tares, grew up to alter the situation,...[having] formed the outward appearance of the kingdom, which today is called Christendom.</p><p>In Christendom there are millions of so-called Christians, but so many of them are not real believers. Let me illustrate this from my own experience. I was born of a Southern Baptist mother. She taught us the stories of the Bible; however, at that time, although she was for Christianity, she herself definitely had not been saved....The professor of world history in the American Presbyterian college where I studied came from a Jewish background. He was a false believer, believing neither in the Bible nor in the resurrection of Christ....Some of the missionaries in China were modernists. Among both the Methodists and the Presbyterians, modernistic missionaries taught the people that the Bible was a book of fairy tales.</p><p>In Matthew 13 we see a picture of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. (Please refer to the chart on pages [30-31, RcV].) The kingdom of God covers everything from eternity past to eternity future. Between the two eternities there is time divided into various ages or dispensations. The first is the dispensation before law....The period of the Patriarchs, the fathers, extending to Moses.... Then comes the dispensation of law. Following this are two crucial dispensations, the first of which is the dispensation of grace, the church age, and the other, the dispensation of the kingdom, the millennium....The kingdom of the heavens covers only these two dispensations. In the dispensation of grace there are a number of complications, for the kingdom of the heavens has three aspects: the aspect of reality [chs. 5-7], the aspect of appearance [ch. 13], and the aspect of manifestation [ch. 24]. As long as the church is normal, it is the reality of the kingdom. In a normal situation the church equals the reality of the kingdom. The third aspect of the kingdom, the manifestation, is in the heavenly part, the upper part, of the millennium.</p><p>The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is today&#8217;s Christendom. It is dark, devilish, and even hellish, and we all must condemn it. Where are you? Are you in the appearance of the kingdom or in the reality of the kingdom?...All real Christians are in the church, but some...have become abnormal and defeated. You may say that you are neither in the world nor in Christendom, the appearance of the kingdom. You are in the church. But are you in the church in a normal situation or in an abnormal situation?...Thus, there are four classes of people: the normal believers, the abnormal [and defeated] believers, the false believers, and the worldly people....We want to be real and normal believers, real sons of the kingdom who...grow Christ by living a life according to the constitution [of the kingdom of the heavens].

First we have the parable of the sower, who sows the seed to bring forth the constituents of the kingdom of the heavens. Then we have the parable of the tares sown by the enemy, the false ones among the constituents that cause the kingdom of the heavens to become Christendom. Following the parable of the tares, we have the parable of the mustard seed (13:31-32).</p><p>Verse 31 says, &#8220;The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed.&#8221; The fruit of the wheat in the first two parables and the fruit of the mustard seed here in the third parable are for food. This indicates that the kingdom people, the constituents of the kingdom and the church, should be like a crop that produces food for the satisfaction of God and man. Both wheat and mustard are good for food....However, in both the second and third parables we see the thought of the evil one, the subtlety of Satan. The evil one came in to sow tares among the wheat. As any farmer can tell you, tares greatly frustrate the growth of the wheat because they exhaust the fertility of the soil which is meant to nourish the growing wheat. Because the soil has been exhausted, wasted, by the tares, the wheat cannot grow properly. We may apply this to our present situation....Wherever there are many false believers, it is difficult for the real believers to grow in life. This is the subtlety of the enemy. As we will see, the subtlety of the enemy with respect to the mustard seed is to cause it to grow into a huge tree that is no longer good for food.</p><p>Verse 32 says that after the mustard seed has grown, &#8220;It is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree.&#8221; The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb that produces food. However, its nature and function were changed, so that it became a &#8220;tree,&#8221; a lodging place for birds. (This is against the law of God&#8217;s creation, that is, that every plant must be after its kind-Gen. 1:11-12.) This change happened in the first part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world. He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church. Hence, this third parable corresponds with the third of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the church in Pergamos (2:12-17). The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant. The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth. But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled as a tree in the earth, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches in which many evil persons and things are lodged. This resulted in the formation of the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>Verse 32 also says that the birds of heaven come and roost in the branches of this tree. Instead of producing foodstuff, this tree is a roost for birds. Because the birds in the first parable signify the evil one, Satan (vv. 4, 19), the birds of heaven in verse 32 must refer to Satan&#8217;s evil spirits with the evil persons and things motivated by them [see Rev. 18:2]. They lodge in the branches of the great tree, that is, in the enterprises of Christendom. The birds refer to the evil one and to evil persons, evil matters, and evil things-in short to all evil pertaining to the evil one. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 461-463, 465)</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 461-466; Hymns: #945 (vv. 1-6, 12)</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 10 - DAY 3</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 13:33</h2><p class="bold">33 &nbsp;Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions form Life-study Messages</h2><p>With the appearance of the kingdom, there are three items: the changed nature, the tares; the changed outward appearance, the fa&#231;ade, the big tree; and the inward rottenness and corruption, the leaven....In the Scriptures leaven signifies evil things (1 Cor. 5:6, 8) and evil doctrines (Matt. 16:6, 11-12). [This brings us to the parable of the leaven.]</p><p>The church, as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ, the unleavened fine flour, as its content, must be a loaf of unleavened bread (1 Cor. 5:7-8). However, the Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century and which is signified by the woman here, took in many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ, leavening the whole content of Christianity. This mixture became the corrupted content of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. This fourth parable corresponds with the fourth of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the church in Thyatira (2:18-29)....Meal, for making the meal offering (Lev. 2:1), signifies Christ as food to both God and man. Three measures is the quantity needed to make a full meal (Gen. 18:6). Hence, the hiding of the leaven in three measures of meal signifies that the Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. This is the actual situation in the Roman Catholic Church. Such leavening is absolutely against the Scriptures, which strongly forbid putting any leaven into the meal offering (Lev. 2:4-5, 11).</p><p>The woman of Matthew 13 is the Jezebel of Revelation 2....Eventually this evil woman will become the great harlot, called Babylon the Great, seen in Revelation 17.... After the papal system had been established, the many pagan practices which had been brought in were confirmed by that system. This is documented in Alexander Hislop&#8217;s book, The Two Babylons.</p><p>Leaven is something added to make things easy to eat....Our natural being likes to use certain methods to make spiritual things easier to assimilate....Not only the Catholic Church has taken in leaven, but the Protestant denominations and groups have also. Rock music and drama are types of leaven....Using basketball for gospel preaching is also leaven....So many things in Christianity are leaven. These include Christmas, Easter, idols, pictures, images,...and the entire YMCA system....Whether or not people receive our word is a matter of the Father&#8217;s will. We do not want to use any gimmicks to help in our preaching. Every gimmick is leaven. We are not for a work or for a movement-we are for the testimony of Jesus....In [preaching the gospel], building up the church, and spreading the Lord&#8217;s testimony, the only way is to pray and to minister the pure Word. In the eyes of God, any gimmick-anything other than Christ, the Word, prayer, and the Spirit-is leaven.</p><p>We must see the difference between the reality of the kingdom and the appearance of the kingdom. The reality is precious to God, but the appearance is abominable to Him. Therefore, we must treasure the reality and reject the appearance. We do not like the tares, the big tree, or the rottenness. We care for the pure wheat flour and the little mustard herb which are good for food. This is the church&#8217;s testimony, which is food to God and man....Many of us can testify that we were hungry for years, but that once we came into the church, we were satisfied....This is the Lord&#8217;s recovery, and this is the dining table.

These are the parables of the sower, the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven. The last three were given privately to the disciples in the house [v. 36]....This indicates that the things covered by these three parables are more hidden.</p><p>In each of the first four parables there was something related to eating. By this we see that the first four parables cover the matter of food. God&#8217;s intention is to have a people on earth to be the constituents of His kingdom, and these people must be like food that is good to satisfy both God and man. But the enemy came in....Here we see Satan&#8217;s subtlety. First, he sowed tares among the wheat to frustrate the growth of the wheat; second, he caused the mustard herb to grow abnormally and to lose its function; third, seeing that some wheat was produced to make fine flour for a loaf to satisfy God and man, Satan added leaven to the meal.</p><p>In the first four parables in Matthew we have the life growing, and in the next parable [v. 44] we have the treasure hidden in the field. The treasure must be made up of gold, silver, and precious stones, probably mainly precious stones. In the following parable [vv. 45-46] we find the pearl. The New Jerusalem is built with gold, precious stones, and pearl....In the first four parables the Lord revealed the life that grows Christ into the kingdom. In the next two parables He revealed the matter of transformation for building. This brings us back to the basic thought of the Bible-life and building. The parables in Matthew 13 reveal the matters of life and building. Life is Christ Himself as the seed sown into our humanity. This life grows within us, growing Christ into the kingdom. The growing of this life eventually produces precious stones and pearls. After spending much time on Matthew 13, I found that its basic thought is the same as that of 1 Corinthians 3. In both chapters we have God&#8217;s cultivated land and God&#8217;s building....If we are not impressed with this matter, we will not be able to understand the fifth and sixth parables.</p><p>The treasure hidden in the field [v. 44] must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem (1 Cor. 3:12; Rev. 21:18-20). Since the church is the practical kingdom today, and the New Jerusalem will be the kingdom in manifestation in the coming age, the treasure hidden in the field must signify the kingdom hidden on God&#8217;s created earth.</p><p>The field in verse 44 is the earth created by God for His kingdom (Gen. 1:26-28). In the Bible the earth signifies the world created by God, and the sea signifies the world corrupted by Satan. The earth also signifies Israel, the Jewish nation, because Israel was chosen by God, separated by God, and placed by God in a specific situation. Hence, the Jewish people stand before God as the earth created by Him. Based upon the same principle, the sea also signifies the Gentile world, for the Gentiles are the people corrupted by Satan.</p><p>The man here [in verse 44] is Christ, who found the kingdom of the heavens in 4:12 to 12:23, hid it in 12:24 to 13:43, and in His joy went to the cross in 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; and 26:1 to 27:52 to sell all He had and to buy the field-that is, to redeem the created and lost earth- for the kingdom...because within the earth there was the kingdom, the treasure.

After finding it in 16:18 and 18:17, He went to the cross and sold all that He had and bought it for the kingdom....The pearl [v. 46], produced in the death waters (the world filled with death) by the living oyster (the living Christ), wounded by a little rock (the sinner), and secreting its life-juice around the wounding rock (the believer), is material for the building of the New Jerusalem. Since the pearl comes out of the sea, which signifies the world corrupted by Satan (Isa. 57:20; Rev. 17:15), it must refer to the church, which is constituted mainly of regenerated believers from the Gentile world and which is of great value.</p><p>According to Revelation 21, the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones and pearls. In other words, the New Jerusalem is a combination of the treasure and the pearl. In Matthew 13 these are two, the treasure in the field and the pearl out of the sea. But in Revelation 21...the New Jerusalem is both the kingdom and the church. In Matthew 16 the terms church and kingdom are used interchangeably [see vv. 18-19]....Ultimately, in the New Jerusalem the kingdom and the church become one entity.</p><p>At this point some may be asking the following question: Since the kingdom is the church and the church is the kingdom, what is the difference between them?...As the kingdom, we are something of the earth created by God and redeemed by Christ; and as the church, we are something out of the world corrupted by Satan and condemned by God. The treasure, the symbol of the kingdom, is concealed within the earth....But the pearl, the symbol of the church,...is something produced out of the sea.</p><p>Among us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery there should be no sea [Rev. 21:1]. Instead of the sea, we should have the renewed earth....If our conversation is filled with talk about worldly things, about money or the movies, it is a sign that we are filled with the things of the Satan-corrupted world. This is the sea. But if among us there is no gossip or criticism, but Christ, the church, and transformation, this is a sign that we are the new earth....Transformation makes us pearls and precious stone, pearls for the church and precious stones for the kingdom.</p><p>The mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens encompass the main points of Christian history between the Lord&#8217;s first coming and His second coming. To interpret these parables properly, we need to take care of the facts of history....What is there in history that can be regarded as the fulfillment of the treasure and the pearl? As I was considering this matter before the Lord, He showed me that in history...there have been the overcomers, who are more solid, genuine, precious, and valuable in the eyes of God than the wheat. In God&#8217;s eyes these overcomers are likened to the treasure hidden in the field and to the pearl out of the sea....Those who are like this are not just the wheat, bulky in size and abundant in quantity; they are the transformed precious stones, smaller in quantity and hidden under the earth. Not many people can see them, but the Lord sees them.</p><p>Many saints...can testify that...during the years they have been in the recovery, they...are constantly being reduced, transformed, and made more solid....This is more than a seed sown in a field to produce wheat; it is something that has become precious through the secretion of the life of Christ....In the Lord&#8217;s recovery the quantity is small, but the quality is higher and more solid, because here we have the treasure and the pearl.

The sea into which this net is cast signifies the Gentile world, and every species signifies all the nations, all the Gentiles (25:32). During the tribulation, Antichrist, who will oppose all religion, will persecute both Christians and Jews. Christ will consider these persecuted Christians His brothers.

[Those who would]... persecute and kill...God&#8217;s people must hear that God will come in to avenge them.</p><p>Christ will judge the living at the time of His coming back. This will take place before the millennium. In addition to the Jews and the Christians,...a number [of unbelievers] will still be living at the time He comes again. These living ones will be the nations....The eternal gospel declared in Revelation 14 will be the basis for Christ&#8217;s judgment upon the living nations....According to Matthew 25 [vv. 32-46], the King will judge the nations according to the way they have treated His little brothers...during the tribulation....Those who treat the believers favorably will be regarded by the King as sheep. But those who do not treat them well will be regarded as goats. The goats [the foul, 13:48], will be cast into eternal fire, but the sheep [the good, 13:48], will be transferred to the millennium to be the citizens on the earth.</p><p>At the end of this chapter the Lord spoke an additional parable [v. 52]....After giving the seven parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom, the Lord likened the discipled scribe to a householder who has a treasure, a rich store of things new and old, signifying not only the new and old knowledge of the Scriptures but also the new and old experiences of life in the kingdom. A scribe...in the Old Testament...knew the books of Moses and the prophets....Such a learned one has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens. Formerly he was a scholar of the Old Testament dispensation, but now he has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens....For this reason he is likened to a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old. When the new things are put with the old things, we have the precious things. The apostle Paul was such a person. He was an Old Testament scribe who one day was discipled into God&#8217;s New Testament economy.</p><p>In giving this parable the Lord was expecting that some of His listeners would be scribes, not all fishermen....At the turn of the new economy, He had to go to Galilee to find the unlearned fishermen. But after the turn had taken place, there would be the need of some learned ones to carry out all the mysteries....I hope that some of the young people will become scribes. For the Lord&#8217;s recovery today we need both the fishermen and the scribes.

With the appearance of the kingdom, there are three items: the changed nature, the tares; the changed outward appearance, the fa&#231;ade, the big tree; and the inward rottenness and corruption, the leaven.</p><p>Following the parable of the tares, the third parable is that of the mustard seed (13:31-32). Here, the enemy in his subtlety caused the mustard seed to grow into a huge tree-a lodging place for birds-that is no longer good for food. This is against the law of God&#8217;s creation, that is, that every plant must be after its kind (Gen. 1:11-12).</p><p>The fourth parable concerns leaven. In the Scriptures leaven signifies evil things (1 Cor. 5:6, 8) and evil doctrines (Matt. 16:6, 11-12). The Roman Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. Our natural being likes to use certain methods to make spiritual things easier to assimilate. In the eyes of God, any gimmick-anything other than Christ, the Word, prayer, and the Spirit-is leaven.</p><p>In the fifth parable we have the treasure hidden in the field (v. 44). Christ redeemed the God-created earth because within the earth, the field, there was the kingdom, the treasure. The next parable reveals Christ as the merchant (v. 45) seeking the church for His kingdom. After finding it He sold all that He had and bought it for the kingdom. Since the pearl comes out of the sea, which signifies the world corrupted by Satan, it must refer to the church, which is constituted mainly of Gentile believers. In the first four parables the Lord revealed the life that grows Christ into the kingdom. In the next two parables He revealed the matter of transformation for building. The overcomers can be regarded as the fulfillment of the treasure and the pearl. Through their remaining under the secretion of Christ&#8217;s life, constantly being constricted, reduced and transformed, they are more solid, genuine, precious, and valuable in the eyes of God than the wheat.</p><p>The first six parables in Matthew 13 are related to the church. The seventh parable, the parable of the net, is related to the world, to the Gentiles. The net here signifies the eternal gospel which will be preached to the Gentile world during the great tribulation (Rev. 14:6-7). The nations are likened to fish in the sea. These &#8220;fish&#8221; are brought to the presence of the Lord, and the Lord exercises His judgment upon them according to the way they have treated the believers during the great tribulation.</p><p>In verse 52 the Lord spoke another parable. A learned one, a scribe, who has been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens is likened to a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old. The apostle Paul was such a person. Today in His recovery, the Lord not only needs the fishermen, but some scribes full of knowledge for the carrying out of His New Testament economy.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p></body></html>
