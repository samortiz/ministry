<p>A condition on the positive side for having prayer answered is faith. Faith is indispensable. Without faith, prayer is ineffectual. The story in Mark 11 speaks loudly of the need for faith in prayer. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them&rdquo; (v. 24). We must believe when we pray. If we believe that we have received what we are praying for, we will have them. We hope that as soon as a person has received the Lord, even a week after his conversion, he will know what faith is. The Lord said, &ldquo;Believe that you have received them, and you will have them.&rdquo; He did not say, &ldquo;Believe that you <em>will receive</em> them&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Believe that you <em>have received</em> them.&rdquo; We should believe that we have received what we asked for, and we will have them. The believing that the Lord speaks of here is followed by its predicate <em>you have received.</em> What is faith? Faith is believing that we have received what we have asked for.</p>
<p>Christians often make the mistake of separating <em>believe</em> from its predicate <em>you have received.</em> They place it before the expression <em>you will have them.</em> They pray to the Lord thinking that it is a matter of great faith to &ldquo;believe...and you will have them.&rdquo; They pray to the Lord that the mountain be taken up and cast into the sea, and they believe that it will be so. They think that this kind of faith is great faith. However, this is to move <em>believe</em> away from <em>you have received</em> and to place it before <em>you will have them.</em> The Bible says that we should believe that we have received, not that we will receive. The two are definitely not the same. Not only do new believers need to learn this, but even those who have been believers for many years need to learn this.</p>
<p>What is faith? Faith is the assurance that God <em>has</em> answered our prayer. It is not the conviction that God <em>will</em> answer our prayer. Faith is when we kneel down to pray and say in an instant, &ldquo;Thank God! He has answered my prayer. Thank God! This matter is settled.&rdquo; This is to believe that we have received. A person may kneel down and pray and may rise and say, &ldquo;I believe that God will definitely hear my prayer.&rdquo; The expression <em>will definitely hear</em> is wrong. No matter how hard he tries to &ldquo;believe&rdquo; in this way, he will not see any result. Suppose you pray for a sick person and he says, &ldquo;Thank God! I am healed.&rdquo; His temperature may still be high; there may be no change in his symptoms at all. But his problem is over because he is clear within himself that he is healed. However, if he says, &ldquo;I believe the Lord will surely heal my sickness,&rdquo; he will probably need to try harder to &ldquo;believe.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Believe that you have received them, and you will have them.&rdquo; He did not say that you will receive if you believe that you <em>will</em> receive. If you turn this around, it does not work. Brothers and sisters, have you seen the key? Genuine faith lies in the phrase <em>It is finished.</em> Genuine faith is thanking God for having already answered your prayers.</p>
<p>We need to say a few words more about faith. Consider the matter of healing. We can find some solid examples of faith in Mark&rsquo;s Gospel. There are three sentences in the Gospel of Mark which bear special significance to prayer. The first relates to the Lord&rsquo;s power, the second to the Lord&rsquo;s will, and the third to the Lord&rsquo;s act.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Lord&rsquo;s Power&mdash;God Can</h2>
<p>Let us look at Mark 9:21-23, which says, &ldquo;And He questioned his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, From childhood. And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us. And Jesus said to him, You say, If You can. All things are possible to him who believes.&rdquo; The father said to the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;If You can do anything...help us.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus repeated his word and said, &ldquo;If You can.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s &ldquo;if You can&rdquo; is a quotation of the father&rsquo;s &ldquo;if You can.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus was repeating what the father said. The father said, &ldquo;If You can do anything...help us.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If You can. All things are possible to him who believes.&rdquo; It was not a question of &ldquo;if You can,&rdquo; but a question of whether or not he could believe.</p>
<p>When man finds himself in difficulty, he is usually full of doubt; he cannot believe in the power of God. This is the first thing we need to deal with. It may seem at times that the power of the obstacle is greater than the power of God. The Lord Jesus rebuked the father for doubting the power of God. In the Bible we seldom find the Lord interrupting a person as He did in this case. It seems that the Lord was angry when He said, &ldquo;If You can.&rdquo; The Lord rebuked the father when the father said, &ldquo;If You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.&rdquo; What the Lord meant was, &ldquo;How can you say, &lsquo;If You can&rsquo;? What is this? All things are possible to him who believes. This is not a matter of &lsquo;if I can,&rsquo; but a matter of whether or not you believe. How dare you ask if I can!&rdquo; When God&rsquo;s children pray, they should learn to lift up their eyes and say, &ldquo;Lord! You can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark 2 records the incident of the Lord healing a paralytic. The Lord said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Child, your sins are forgiven&rdquo; (v. 5). Some scribes reasoned in their hearts, saying, &ldquo;Why is this man speaking this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except One, God?&rdquo; (v. 7). In their hearts they thought that only God could forgive sins and that Jesus could not. They regarded forgiveness of sins as a great thing. But the Lord said to them, &ldquo;Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts? Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk?&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). The Lord was showing them that to man it was a question of whether or not one could do it, but to God it was a question of which was easier. For man, it is impossible for anyone to forgive sins or to ask the paralytic to stand up and walk. However, the Lord showed them that He could forgive sins as well as make the paralytic rise up and walk. Both forgiving and making the paralytic rise up and walk were easy for the Lord. The Lord was showing them that &ldquo;God can.&rdquo; In our prayer we need to know that &ldquo;God can&rdquo; and that nothing is too difficult for the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> </body></html>
