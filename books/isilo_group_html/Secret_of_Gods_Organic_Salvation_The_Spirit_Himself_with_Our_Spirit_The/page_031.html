THE SECRET OF THE INTENSIFIED WORK<br />OF GOD&rsquo;S ORGANIC SALVATION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Degradation of the Church</h2><p>In considering the secret of the intensified work of God&rsquo;s organic salvation, the first matter we need to pay attention to is the degradation of the church. If there had been no degradation, there would have been no need for Christ to be intensified sevenfold. Christ&rsquo;s sevenfold intensification is due to the degradation of the church.</p><h2 class="head3">1. At the End of Paul&rsquo;s Ministry</h2><p>The degradation of the church took place at the end of the apostle Paul&rsquo;s ministry, around the A.D. 60s.</p><h2 class="head4">a. The Believers Turning Away</h2><p>All the believers in Asia turned away from Paul (2 Tim. 1:15). They turned away not from Paul&rsquo;s person but from his ministry.</p><h2 class="head4">b.

At the End of Peter&rsquo;s Ministry</h2><h2 class="head3">The degradation at the end of the apostle Peter&rsquo;s ministry also took place around the A.D. 60s.</h2><h2 class="head4">a. False Teachers</h2><h2 class="head4">False teachers were teaching heresy, denying the Lord&rsquo;s redemption (2 Pet. 2:1).</h2><h2 class="head4">b. Forsaking the Straight Way</h2><h2 class="head4">The evil ones forsook the straight way, that is, the New Testament way, going astray and following the way of Balaam, who loved the wages of unrighteousness (v. 15).</h2><h2 class="head4">c. Mockers</h2><p>Mockers were mocking, not believing in the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (3:3-4).</p><h2 class="head4">d.
