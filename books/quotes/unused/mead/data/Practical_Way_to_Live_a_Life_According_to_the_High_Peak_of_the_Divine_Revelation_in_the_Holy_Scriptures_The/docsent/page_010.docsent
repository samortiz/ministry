   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Philippians 3:10 says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This verse unveils three items which Paul wanted to know.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, Paul wanted to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, he wanted to know the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Third, he wanted to know the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We want to see the practical way to live a life according to the high peak of the divine revelation, which is not out of man's imagination but in the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This high peak is that God became man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The eternal, infinite, self-existing, ever-existing, and almighty God one day became a man, like you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The human race has a history of about six thousand years, from the creation of Adam to our time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God became a man only about two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>About four thousand years before God became a man, He created man in His image and after His likeness Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man is in the image of God and after the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose a little boy made a clay toy in the image and likeness of a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the little boy's friend saw it, he would say, "You have made a lion."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely that is a real toy, but it is in the image of a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God made a real man according to His kind, not according to man's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, man in himself has no kind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Mankind is "Godkind."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One day God shaped some clay in His own image and after His own likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That man was according to God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We human beings are in God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After His creation of man He did not do anything to mingle Himself with man for four thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But He did promise mankind that a threefold seed would come: the seed of the woman Gen 3:15 , the seed of Abraham 22:18 , and the seed of David 2 Sam 7:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The seed of the woman would bruise the head of Satan, the seed of Abraham would be a blessing to all the nations on earth, and the seed of David would build up God's temple and set up God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 these three seeds are one person, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is also a prophecy in the Old Testament saying that a virgin would be with child and bear a son Isa 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the fulfillment of the promise of the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaiah said that this human son, this human child, is called the Mighty God and the Eternal Father 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, the threefold seed is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is divine, and the threefold seed is human.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that the divine God would become a human seed, a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Micah 5:2 says that out of Bethlehem would come forth a ruler, whose goings forth are of old, from the days of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can see such a record in the Old Testament, but after God created man in His kind, He did not do anything for His New Testament economy for four thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Within these four thousand years, He promised and prophesied that He would come to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the whole universe there was God, there were the angels, there were men, but there had never been a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One day an extraordinary event took place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesus was born.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is both God and man, the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God became a man by the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This God-man became the firstborn Son of God Rom 1:3-4; 8:29 , and the firstborn Son indicates, no doubt, that many brothers will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In eternity before God created man, He had chosen millions of men to be His many sons Eph 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today our being the many sons of God is not based upon creation, but based upon God's selection, God's choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He chose us in eternity past, and one day He regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He regenerated us on the same day Jesus was born to be the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In His resurrection we were born to be the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indicates that the firstborn Son is a prototype, and the many sons are the mass reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What should we as the reproduction of the firstborn Son of God be?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should be the God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was the first God-man, the prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was the original copy for xeroxing, and we are the following copies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should be exactly the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is a God-man, and we should be the God-men.</S>
