To Break Assyria</H2><P>The Assyrians put a yoke and a burden upon Israel. Therefore, Jehovah's judgment is to break Assyria because of its yoke and burden upon Israel (14:24-27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Destroy Philistia</H2><P>Jehovah's judgment also destroyed Philistia because of its damage to Zion (vv. 29-32).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Devastate Moab</H2><P>Jehovah's judgment was to devastate Moab (15:1) because of its pride (16:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. To Ruin and Forsake Damascus</H2><P>Jehovah's judgment was also upon Damascus, the capital of Aram. Damascus was to be ruined and forsaken (17:1-4) because of its invasion into Israel (vv. 12-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. To Strike and Desolate Egypt</H2><P>In His judgment Jehovah would also strike and desolate Egypt (19:1, 5-7, 22a) because of its idols and wise men (vv. 1b, 11b-12). Here we see that God ranks wise men together with idols.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. To Capture Egypt into Captivity<br>and Cush into Exile</H2><P>In 20:4-6 we see that the judgment of Jehovah was to capture Egypt into captivity and Cush into exile by the king of Assyria, because Cush had become Israel's expectation and Egypt, their boast. Instead of trusting in God, Israel expected to receive help from Cush and to gain something from Egypt for their boast. God hated this and judged the nations because of it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. To Have No Judgment on Dumah</H2><P>God would have no judgment on Dumah (21:11-12). Dumah means silence; it is in assonance with Edom and it is like Edom in the desolation in store. Hence, the calling to the prophet is from Seir, which is in the mountain range of Edom and which is the capital of Edom. The prophecy concerning Dumah in verse 12 means that it is the same in the day as in the night and nothing is happening.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
