   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This wonderful One is the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this seed are death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this seed are the receiving of the bride, the wisdom, the building of the house of God, and the bruising of the serpent's head.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this seed are the passing through of all the tests, temptations, sufferings, and eventually the reaching of the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this seed are the human element and the divine element, humanity and divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Abraham and Isaac are included, and so are David and Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit are all included in the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This little seed is the all-inclusive wonderful One!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a Jesus is this very One in whom we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This Jesus, this wonderful One, is the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Testament is a book concerning the kingdom, and the first book presents the Lord Jesus as the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This seed is called Jehovah-plus and God-plus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE SEED BEING THE KING Accepted by the Gentiles</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter two shows us that this seed of the kingdom is the King.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus was accepted by Gentiles who had no religion, no Bible knowledge, no religious forms, no doctrines, and no teachings Matt 2:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a simple people accepted Him as a King.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They did not know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was to such a people simple ones without any Bible knowledge or religious concepts and who did not even know how to worship and serve God that Jesus, the wonderful Person was revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was revealed to them and accepted by them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Neglected by Religion</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus, on the contrary, was neglected by the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The chief priests and scribes were in the highest position among the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They had knowledge; they knew the Scriptures and even knew where Christ was to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet none of them cared for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When they heard the news of His birth, no one went to Bethlehem to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They just discussed Micah 5:2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of their indifference, they neglected the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many religious people today are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In many cases, after the religious ones talk about Jesus in their services, they go their own way some go fishing, others gamble or pursue their worldly pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When one of my college classmates became a Christian, he and others began to have communion in his home on Sunday evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After their so-called communion, they turned the table cover over and used the same table for a gambling game.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Among today's Christians, many talk about the Lord Jesus, but very few care for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their Jesus only belongs to the cathedral or the pulpit or the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the religious service is over, the people do as they please.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you went into their wonderful cathedral to tell them what the Lord Jesus really is, they would be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They would say that you teach falsely because they never heard such teaching from their priests or pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, Matthew 2 shows us the proper persons to accept the seed of the kingdom: not the religious ones with Bible knowledge, but simple people who can receive the heavenly vision, and to whom the heavenly star can appear.</S>
