<h2 class="head1">BEING THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH<br />
TO THE GAINING OF THE SOUL</h2>
<p>Paul says that we are those &ldquo;who have faith to the gaining of the soul&rdquo; (v. 39). The saving, or gaining, of our soul does not refer to eternal salvation. The saving of our spirit is related to eternal salvation. The saving of our body will take place at the Lord&rsquo;s return, when our body will be redeemed and transfigured. Between our spirit and our body is our soul. Those who are redeemed by the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood and are regenerated have received the salvation of their spirit and are saved eternally. One day their bodies will also be redeemed and saved. However, in the eyes of the Lord, if they do not walk the way of the Lord, or if they shrink back, they are not saved in their souls. This will be a problem to them in the future.</p>
<p>I am burdened that we would know the situation that the Lord has brought us into. Some of us may feel that our life is depressing and boring, and we may also feel that we are burdened and in a difficult situation. This is the result of not understanding that we are on a spiritual journey. The Lord has placed us on this pathway. Hence, we should not expect these trials to end. Our life is the way of trials. With respect to the environment, this pathway is full of trials. With respect to ourselves, it is the way of faith. Outwardly, it is the way of trials; inwardly, it is the way of faith. From now until we meet the Lord we should not expect to be delivered from trials.</p>
<p>Although other people may not have problems and may do things without difficulty, nothing seems to be easy for us. The Lord will not withhold food from us, but while others eat their food with delight, we do not. It is not that the Lord does not provide for us, but He provides for us according to His assessment of our need. Consequently, while others are enjoying their provisions peacefully, we go through many difficulties. Even though the Lord will bring us through, we will experience thorns and thistles. Outwardly, we may appear to be doing well, but we know the stripping and the torment we have experienced. These are part of the trials.</p>
<p>Since the Lord is bringing us to the pathway of trials, we must learn the lesson of faith. It is better to have what is unseen than what is seen. It is better to choose what is bitter than what is sweet. It is better to choose people&rsquo;s opposition than welcome their sympathy. It is better to be in poverty than to be in wealth and abundance. This requires faith. If instead of learning the lesson of faith, we yearn for the past experiences, some of us will either fall or shrink back.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOOKING AWAY UNTO JESUS,<br />
THE AUTHOR AND PERFECTER OF OUR FAITH</h2>
<p>As the night becomes darker, we must be prepared to live by faith. However, when the night is at its darkest hour, the dawn will come. If we do not wait for the dawn, we will either fall or shrink back. We must exercise our faith and remember that the saints in the Old Testament were all witnesses of faith. They were not authors of faith or perfecters of faith. The Lord is the unique Author and Perfecter of our faith. Therefore, we must strive to know Him. This is the purpose of Hebrews.</p>
<p>The first few chapters of Hebrews speak of what the Lord is. The revelation of the Lord Jesus in Hebrews is different from the revelation of the Lord in Revelation. Revelation shows the position and glory of the Lord Jesus in God&rsquo;s plan, whereas Hebrews shows who the Lord Jesus is in the believers&rsquo; life of faith. Revelation speaks of the Christ in God&rsquo;s plan; Hebrews speaks of the Christ in the believers&rsquo; living&mdash;His person and position in the believers&rsquo; living. Therefore, when reading Hebrews, we must see that Christ is the object of our faith in our living. Christ will become the motivating power in our living and the object of our faith. For this reason, Hebrews speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s human living.</p>
<p>Hebrews says that the Lord is able to sympathize with and help those who are being tempted, because in His human living He passed through trials and temptations (2:18; 4:15). If we read the first few chapters of Hebrews with this in mind, we will see that the Lord Jesus desires to come into our life to be our motivating power and the object of our faith. The more we know the Lord in this way, the more we will consider Him and look away unto Him.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 does not speak concerning knowing Christ. This chapter speaks of looking away and comparing. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls.&rdquo; <em>Compare Him</em> means to consider the Lord to see what kind of person He is. We should consider how He lived as a man on the earth, how He conducted His human living, how He walked, where He is today, what He is doing, and what He is to us. These are the things we should consider. The result of our considering the Lord in this way is that we will look away unto Him.</p>
<p>Verse 2 says, &ldquo;Looking away unto Jesus.&rdquo; This means that our looking away unto Jesus cuts us off from everything in our background and environment. Casting ourselves upon the Lord is the motivating power of our walk. On the one hand, we must learn to exercise our faith in all kinds of situations. On the other hand, we must learn to know the Lord in every situation. Furthermore, we should consider the Lord always so that we can look away unto Him. As we look away unto Him, we are separated from our situations of the present and the past. May we cast ourselves completely on Him and look only unto Him. This is our strength. May the Lord lead us to learn these lessons.</p>
