OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(52)</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Philippians. The subject and the controlling concept of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ. The experience of Christ is the master key which opens this book to us. If we apply this key to every verse and phrase in the book, we will see that Paul&rsquo;s concern here is nothing other than the experience of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">74. The Means for<br />
Bearing the Fruit of Righteousness</h2>
<p>In Philippians 1:11 Christ is revealed as the means for bearing the fruit of righteousness. In verses 9 and 10 Paul prays three things on behalf of the Philippians: that their love would abound in full knowledge and all discernment, that they would approve by testing the things which differ, and that they would be pure and without offense unto the day of Christ. The secret to these three matters is found in verse 11, where Paul speaks of being &ldquo;filled with the fruit of righteousness, which is through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.&rdquo; According to grammar, verse 11 is a modifier related to the three items for which Paul has prayed. Having been filled with the fruit of righteousness, the Philippians could abound in love, approve by testing all things, and be pure and without offense. This indicates that being filled with the fruit of righteousness through Jesus Christ is a necessary condition for these three matters. In order for our love to abound, to approve by testing the things which differ, and to be pure and without offense, we must first be filled with the fruit of righteousness which is through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 11 refers to the experience of Christ. Here we see that the key is the experience of Christ. We know that verse 11 refers to the experience of Christ because of the phrase &ldquo;through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The fruit of righteousness is through Christ. It comes to us through our experience of Christ. From the Christ we enjoy and experience, we have the fruit of righteousness. The more we experience Christ, the more this experience will issue in the fruit of righteousness. The fruit of righteousness is the living product of the believers&rsquo; living a proper life by the element of righteousness, with a righteous standing before God and man. Such a life could be lived not by the believers&rsquo; natural man for their boast but through Jesus Christ as the believers&rsquo; life, experienced by them to the glory and praise of God. Through Christ we should be fruitful in the matter of righteousness; we should not be wrong with God or man in anything. Then we will have the rich fruit in the matter of righteousness. If we experience Christ as the means for bearing the fruit of righteousness, our love will abound, we will prove things by testing, and we will be pure and without offense.</p>
<h2 class="head3">75. The Bountiful Supplier</h2>
<p>Philippians 1:19-21 presents Christ as the bountiful Supplier. In Philippians 1:19 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The bountiful supply comes out of the Spirit of Jesus Christ; hence, Christ as the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the bountiful Supplier. The Greek word for <em>bountiful supply</em> in verse 19 refers to the supplying of all the needs of the chorus by the choragus, the leader of the chorus. The bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit enabled Paul to live and magnify Christ in his sufferings for Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. As the Spirit of Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Christ as the bountiful Supplier is the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The revelation in the Bible concerning God, Christ, and the Spirit is progressive. The Spirit is mentioned first as the Spirit of God, in relation to creation (Gen. 1:2). Then He is mentioned as the Spirit of Jehovah, in the context of God&rsquo;s relationship with man (Judg. 3:10; 1 Sam. 10:6); as the Holy Spirit, in relation to the conception and birth of Christ (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:20); as the Spirit of Jesus, in relation to the Lord&rsquo;s human living (Acts 16:7); as the Spirit of Christ, in relation to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (Rom. 8:9); and here as the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; mentioned in John 7:39. This is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, compounded with the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation (humanity), human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection. The holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25, a compound of olive oil and four kinds of spices, is a full type of this compound Spirit of God, who is now the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Here it is not the Spirit of Jesus or the Spirit of Christ but the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus is related mainly to the Lord&rsquo;s humanity and human living; the Spirit of Christ is related mainly to the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. To experience the Lord&rsquo;s humanity, as illustrated in Philippians 2:5-8, we need the Spirit of Jesus. To experience the power of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, as mentioned in 3:10, we need the Spirit of Christ. In his suffering, the apostle experienced both the Lord&rsquo;s suffering in His humanity and the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. Hence, the Spirit to him was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God. Such a Spirit has, and even is, the bountiful supply for a person like the apostle, who was experiencing and enjoying Christ in His human living and resurrection. Eventually, this compound Spirit of Jesus Christ becomes the seven Spirits of God, who are the seven lamps of fire before God&rsquo;s throne to carry out His administration on earth for the accomplishing of His economy concerning the church, and who are the seven eyes of the Lamb for the transfusing of all that He is into the church (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6).</p>
<p>We are not satisfied simply to have a doctrinal understanding of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. We must go on to experience the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit who is the processed Triune God as everything to us. By such a Spirit, Paul suffered for God&rsquo;s economy and simultaneously enjoyed a bountiful supply that strengthened him in resurrection. Paul was an overcomer not because he had a strong will. He could be an overcomer because he experienced and enjoyed the all-inclusive Spirit with His bountiful supply dwelling in him to be everything to him. Paul realized in his experience that the Triune God was working Himself into his being. May we also experience and enjoy the Triune God supplying us and working Himself into us as the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>With the Spirit of Jesus Christ there is a bountiful supply. This supply is an all-inclusive drink containing many ingredients. Everything we need is in this divine beverage. When we pray in a genuine way and when we call on the name of the Lord, the compound ointment is applied to us in our situation, and we enjoy the riches of the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head4">b. For the Believers to Live Christ</h2>
<p>The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is for us to live Christ. In Philippians 1:19 Paul says, &ldquo;I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Salvation in this verse means to be sustained and strengthened to live and magnify Christ; this requires the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The circumstances in which Paul found himself forced him to experience and enjoy Christ in a fuller way through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Paul&rsquo;s circumstances encouraged him to live Christ and to magnify Christ.</p>
<p>In verse 21 Paul continues, &ldquo;For to me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s life was to live Christ. If we would live Christ, we must take Him as our person and be one person with Him. He and we must be one in a practical way. In Galatians 2:20 Paul declares, &ldquo;It is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; For Paul, this was not a mere doctrine; it was a fact. It should also be real to us that Christ lives in us. Furthermore, we should abide in Him and allow Him to abide in us.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s life was to live Christ. To him, to live was Christ, not the law or circumcision. He would not live the law but would live Christ, not be found in the law but be found in Christ (Phil. 3:9). Christ was not only his life within but also his living without. He lived Christ because Christ lived in him. He was one with Christ both in life and in living. He and Christ had one life and one living. They lived together as one person. Christ lived within him as his life, and he lived Christ without as His living. The normal experience of Christ is to live Him, and to live Him is to magnify Him always, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
<p>To live Christ is not merely to have a holy life or to live holiness. To live Christ is to live a person. We should simply live Christ. We should live a life which is Christ Himself. In our Christian life, quite often we are still the ones living our natural life. We are not living Christ. To live Christ is to let Christ Himself live from within us.</p>
<p>In order to live Christ, we must take Him as our person and as our life. Every morning we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You for another day to practice living You. Lord, in myself I cannot do this. I ask You to remind me to live You and grant me the grace that I need for this.&rdquo; God does not care for how holy, spiritual, or victorious we are in ourselves. Actually, to live in this way by self-effort is to strive to keep the law. What counts in the eyes of God is Christ and the living of Christ. We all must fight and struggle to enter into the genuine living of Christ in a practical way. God wants His people to live Christ. We should not care for holiness, spirituality, or victory as things in themselves, and we should not care for our natural virtues or attributes. Instead, we should focus our whole attention on living Christ and care only to live Christ so that He might be magnified in us.</p>
<p>In the book of Philippians Paul encourages us to think the one thing (2:2). This one thing is to live Christ. We should care only to live Christ and magnify Him. Instead of pursuing holiness, spirituality, or victory, we should seek to live Christ and magnify Him always with all boldness, whether through life or through death. God&rsquo;s desire today is that we live Christ. We should not allow anything to distract us from the direct, personal experience of Christ. Today we need to focus our attention on the one thing&mdash;to live Christ.</p>
<p>When Paul was in prison, he was living Christ. Therefore, he could be found not in the law but in Christ. At any time men, angels, and demons could find him in Christ. We also need to be found by others in Christ, not simply in our good behavior. Others should sense that there is something different about us. All our relatives, friends, and colleagues should find us in Christ.</p>
<p>If we would be found in Christ, we must live Christ. Only when we live Christ will we be found in Him by others and by the angels and demons. However, if we are law-keepers, we will be found in the law instead of in Christ. We are not here to express the law or magnify the law; our goal is to express Christ and magnify Him. We all need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me and rescue me not only from sinful things but also from good things, even spiritual things, that replace You in my daily life. Lord, rescue me from everything back to Yourself. I ask You to grant me the grace each day so that I may truly live You and be found in You.&rdquo; May we all seek the one thing and pursue the one thing&mdash;to live Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is our life. We, the God-men, live a human life to express God, not by our own life, our natural life, but by the divine life of Christ in resurrection (Col. 3:4). This living of Christ includes pursuing and gaining Christ (Phil. 3:8, 12-14). If we have not gained Christ, we cannot live Him. Living Christ also includes tasting Christ for growing in Him (1 Pet. 2:2-3) and enjoying Christ as the God-allotted portion and participating in His riches in the fellowship of God (Col. 1:12). First Corinthians 1:9 says that God has called us into the fellowship of Christ, the enjoyment of Christ. If we do not gain Him or taste Him, we cannot enjoy Him and thereby live Him.</p>
<p>Abiding in Christ and having Him abide in us for His life to grow in fruit-bearing are also a part of living Christ (John 15:4-5). To live Christ by the divine life of Christ in resurrection is to have Christ grow in us so that we may be conformed to the image of Christ as the Firstborn among many brothers (Gal. 4:19; Rom. 8:29b). Furthermore, to live Christ includes growing into Christ in everything that we may mature in the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Col. 1:28b; Eph. 4:15, 13b).</p>
<p>For us to live Christ means that no matter what our circumstances may be, Christ is magnified in us, and we are not put to shame in anything. In the apostle&rsquo;s suffering in his body, Christ was magnified; that is, Christ was shown or declared to be great (without limitation), exalted, and extolled. The apostle&rsquo;s sufferings afforded him opportunity to express Christ in His unlimited greatness. The apostle would have only Christ magnified in him, not the law or circumcision. The book of Philippians is concerned with the experience of Christ. To magnify Christ under any circumstances is to experience Him with the topmost enjoyment.</p>
<p>If we allow the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ to work in us, our daily living will be changed. Through the proper living, Christ will appear to be great in the eyes of others. We will be burdened to magnify Christ always and with all boldness. Through our magnifying of Christ, others will see His greatness and His unlimitedness. To magnify Christ in such a way is to live Him.</p>
<p>Christ is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. As such, He is in our spirit, and He is joined to our spirit as one mingled spirit. We need to remain in the mingled spirit, live in the mingled spirit, breathe in the mingled spirit, pray in the mingled spirit, and fellowship with Him in the mingled spirit. Christ as the Spirit in our spirit should direct us in everything. To live Christ is to live the Spirit who has entered into our spirit to become one spirit with us. Hence, to live Christ is a matter of living in our mingled spirit.</p>
<p>The central thought of the Bible is that God desires us to live Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ. The main point of our Christian life is to live Christ. To live Christ should be our primary goal; all the troubles in our Christian life come because of our not living Christ. We need to practice to live Christ, realizing that He is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, until we live Christ habitually.</p>
<p>The climax, the highest point, of the divine revelation in the entire Bible is to live Christ. In order to live Christ, we must practice being one spirit with Him, and in order to practice being one spirit with Him, we must exercise our spirit to pray unceasingly. If we pray unceasingly from our spirit, &ldquo;Lord, live in me; Lord, live through me,&rdquo; we will build up a habit of not living our self but Christ; then we will live Christ habitually. The habit of living Christ is the habit of prayer. Apart from unceasingly praying, we cannot live Christ. It is only by such continual prayer, such breathing prayer, that we can live Christ spontaneously. In order to have such a prayer life, we must watch and pray, praying at every time in spirit, watching unto prayer in all petition, and persevering in prayer (Matt. 26:41; Eph. 6:18; Col. 4:2). Moreover, the foundation for us to pray is our love for the Lord. Because we love the Lord and seek Him, we like to contact Him, pray to Him, and call upon Him. Part of the secret of living Christ is telling the Lord again and again that we love Him.</p>
<p>Living Christ requires that we love Him to the uttermost. As we are engaged in our daily activities, our living should not be those activities but Christ. Our mind should be concentrated on Christ, but the concentration of our mind on Christ depends upon our love for Christ. This is the reason that the New Testament charges us to love Christ (Mark 12:30; Rev. 2:4-5; John 14:23; 21:15-17; 1 Pet. 1:8). If we do not love Christ, we cannot live Him; loving Him is the best way to concentrate our entire being on Him. When a young mother delivers a child, her whole living is that new baby; for her, to live is her new baby because of her love for her child. Likewise, when we love Christ to the uttermost, our entire being is occupied with Him, and we live Him. We need Christ to captivate us to an extent that even in our dreams we would live Christ.</p>
<p>In summary, we need to live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. We need to be saved from the failure of not living Christ and from the defeat of not magnifying Christ. The Spirit has a rich provision to supply us in full to live Christ for His magnification. The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ contains all that the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash;embodied in the all-inclusive Christ who is realized as the all-inclusive Spirit&mdash;is, has, has accomplished, obtained, attained, and will do. This bountiful supply of the Spirit is the unsearchable riches of Christ to meet in time the need of the seekers of Christ. When we truly seek after Christ, we will receive this bountiful supply. It is by such a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ that the seekers of Christ, as His overcomers in the consummation of this age, live Him for His magnification in the New Testament economy of God for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ as the counterpart of the consummated Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as His eternal enlargement and expression for eternity.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(53)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">76. The Pattern</h2>
<p>Philippians 2 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as our pattern. In chapter 1 the central point is to magnify Christ, to live Christ (vv. 20-21). In chapter 2 it is to take Christ as our pattern, our model. This pattern is the standard of our salvation (v. 12). Verses 5 through 16 reveal that the word of life works out the pattern by the operating God in order to apply salvation to our daily living. In this way we enjoy Christ and live Him, taking Him as our pattern.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Mind in Him to Be in Us</h2>
<p>In Philippians 2:3-4 Paul says, &ldquo;Doing nothing by way of selfish ambition nor by way of vainglory, but in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves; not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also.&rdquo; In verse 5 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the mind that was in Christ Jesus should be in us. <em>This</em> in verse 5 refers to <em>considering</em> in verse 3 and <em>regarding</em> in verse 4. This kind of thinking, this kind of mind, was also in Christ when He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, and humbled Himself, being found in fashion as a man (vv. 7-8). To have such a mind requires us to be one with Christ in His inward parts (1:8). To experience Christ, we need to be one with Him to this extent, that is, in His tender, inward feeling and in His thinking.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Not Considering Equality with God<br />
a Treasure to Be Grasped</h2>
<p>Philippians 2:6 says, &ldquo;Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;existing&rdquo; denotes existing from the beginning, implying the Lord&rsquo;s eternal preexistence. The word <em>form</em> refers to the expression, not the fashion, of God&rsquo;s being (Heb. 1:3). It is identified with the essence and nature of God&rsquo;s person and thus expresses His essence and nature. This refers to Christ&rsquo;s deity.</p>
<p>In Philippians 2:6 Paul tells us that Christ did not consider equality with God a treasure to be grasped. Although the Lord was equal with God, instead of holding on to His equality with God, He did not consider this equality a treasure to be grasped and retained. Rather, He laid aside the form of God (not the nature of God) and emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Emptying Himself,<br />
Taking the Form of a Slave,<br />
Becoming in the Likeness of Men</h2>
<p>Verse 7 goes on to say that Christ &ldquo;emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men.&rdquo; When Christ emptied Himself, He laid aside what He possessed&mdash;the form of God. The word <em>form</em> in verse 7 is the same word as that used for the form of God in verse 6. In His incarnation the Lord did not alter His divine nature; He changed only His outward expression, from the form of God, the highest form, to that of a slave, the lowest form. This was not a change of essence but of state.</p>
<p>The word <em>becoming</em> in verse 7 indicates entering into a new state. According to this verse, Christ became in the &ldquo;likeness of men.&rdquo; The form of God implies the inward reality of Christ&rsquo;s deity; the likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity. He appeared outwardly to men as a man, but as God He had the reality of deity inwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Humbling Himself, Becoming Obedient<br />
Even unto Death, and That the Death of a Cross</h2>
<p>Verse 8 continues, &ldquo;And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.&rdquo; When Christ became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in fashion as a man by men. The word <em>fashion</em> implies the outward guise, the semblance. What Christ looked like in His humanity was found by men to be in fashion as a man.</p>
<p>First, Christ emptied Himself by putting aside the form, the outward expression, of His deity and by becoming in the likeness of men. Christ was God with the expression of God. Although He was equal with God, He put aside this equality and emptied Himself by taking the likeness of men. This indicates that He became a man through incarnation. Then, being found in fashion as a man, in the appearance of a man, Christ humbled Himself by becoming obedient even unto death. This means that when He was a man, He did not insist on anything. Rather, He humbled Himself to the point of dying on the cross. This is Christ as our pattern.</p>
<p>Humbling Himself was a further step in emptying Himself. Christ&rsquo;s self-humbling manifests His self-emptying. The death of the cross was the climax of Christ&rsquo;s humiliation. To the Jews this was a curse (Deut. 21:22-23). To the Gentiles it was a death sentence imposed upon malefactors and slaves (Matt. 27:16-17, 20-23). Hence, it was a shameful thing (Heb. 12:2).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s humiliation involved seven steps: (1) emptying Himself; (2) taking the form of a slave; (3) becoming in the likeness of men; (4) humbling Himself; (5) becoming obedient; (6) being obedient even unto death; and (7) being obedient unto the death of the cross.</p>
<p>The pattern presented in these verses is now the life within us. This life is what we call a crucified life. The seven steps of Christ&rsquo;s humiliation are all aspects of the crucified life. Although Christ had the expression of deity, He laid aside this expression. However, He did not lay aside the reality of His deity. He laid aside the higher form, the form of God, and took on a much lower form, the form of a slave. In this, He emptied Himself. Surely this is a mark of a crucified life. Then, after becoming a man and being found in the appearance of a man, Christ humbled Himself even unto the death of the cross. This was the crucified life lived out in a full and absolute way.</p>
<p>Christ is not only an outward pattern for us; He is also the life within us. As this inner life, He would have us experience Him and thereby live a crucified life. In this crucified life there is no room for rivalry, vainglory, or self-exaltation. On the contrary, there is self-emptying and self-humbling. Whenever we experience Christ and live Christ, we automatically live such a crucified life. This means that when we live Christ, we live the One who is the pattern of a crucified life. Then we also will empty ourselves and humble ourselves.</p>
<p>If we did not have the crucified life within us, we could never live according to the pattern presented in Philippians 2. Only the crucified life can live such a pattern. If we still do things out of rivalry and vainglory or are still ambitious to be leaders, we are not living a crucified life. We are not emptying ourselves or humbling ourselves. However, we have a life within us that truly is a self-emptying and self-humbling life. This life never grasps at something as a treasure. Instead, it is always willing to lay aside position and title.</p>
<p>When the pattern in Philippians 2 becomes our inward life, the pattern becomes our salvation. Then we are saved from rivalry and vainglory. If the Philippians were not willing to live according to this pattern, they could not make Paul&rsquo;s joy full. He would still be troubled by their rivalry and vainglory. But if they were willing to live the crucified life, a life that always empties itself and humbles itself, not grasping anything as a treasure, they would have the genuine experience of Christ. Their experience of Christ as such a pattern and inward life would make the apostle extremely happy.</p>
<p>In Philippians 2 we see that we should live a crucified life so that we may enjoy the power of resurrection. We should take the crucified life in verses 5 through 8 as our pattern so that we can experience the power of resurrection, which exalted Christ to the highest peak in the universe (v. 9). Both the experience of Christ as the pattern of a crucified life and the experience of the resurrection power that exalts Him are endless. Day by day we need to live a crucified life. This is to live Christ as our pattern. Instead of having a life of rivalry and vainglory, we should live a life of self-emptying and self-humbling. This is to live a crucified life. By means of this life, we are ushered into the power of resurrection by which Christ is exalted.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need among us the believers to experience Christ as our pattern. We desperately need to experience Him as our crucified life. Such a life stands altogether in contrast to a life of rivalry and vainglory. In the church life we either take the crucified life as our pattern or automatically live a life of rivalry and vainglory. There is no third way. If we do not take the crucified life as our pattern, we will automatically live in the way of rivalry and vainglory. The issue here is extremely serious. We need to be honest with ourselves and consider the kind of life we have been living in the church. Whenever we do not take the crucified life as our pattern, we are living a life of rivalry and vainglory.</p>
<p>The highest life on earth is the crucified life, that is, Christ Himself as the One who emptied Himself and humbled Himself. Whenever we live a crucified life, God will bring us into the power of resurrection, and in this power we will be exalted. Furthermore, none of us in the church life should hold to any personal standing. We must stand firm for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, yet we should not claim any standing, title, or position for ourselves. Making such claims will never bring us into the power of resurrection. We need to take the crucified life as our pattern. Eventually, we will enter into the power of resurrection where we experience God&rsquo;s exaltation. Instead of seeking glory for ourselves, we should seek Christ and Him alone; then we will experience the crucified life.</p>
<p>We need Paul&rsquo;s word concerning Christ as our pattern. We need to be enlightened and take this crucified life as our pattern so that we may experience the power of resurrection. When we live the crucified life, we will be ushered into resurrection power, and this power will exalt us. We should not seek any glory that is other than Christ Himself. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I want only You. I am not seeking any exaltation or glory.&rdquo; If we take the crucified life as our pattern, we will experience the power of resurrection. This resurrection power is Christ Himself. Christ is not only the crucified life but also the resurrection power.</p>
<p>Often the saints complain of weaknesses. We are weak whenever we do not take the crucified life as our pattern. If we are weak in our family life, daily life, or church life, it is an indication that we are not taking the crucified life and therefore are not in the power of resurrection. The gate through which we enter into the power of resurrection is the crucified life. Paul&rsquo;s expectation concerning the saints in Philippi was that they would live this crucified life and then experience the power of resurrection.</p>
<p>The pattern Paul presents in 2:5-8 is not only objective but also subjective. We must ask where this Christ is who is our pattern. Is He in heaven, or is He in us? Verse 9 indicates clearly that God has highly exalted Christ. Thus, there can be no doubt that, as our pattern, Christ is in heaven. He has been exalted to the highest peak in the universe, where God is. This is related to the objective aspect of the pattern. However, if Christ were only in the third heaven objectively, how could we take Him as our pattern today? How could we, who are on earth, follow One who has been exalted and who is now in heaven? It would be impossible. In order for us to take Christ as our pattern, this pattern must also be subjective.</p>
<p>Verse 12 indicates that the pattern is subjective: &ldquo;So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&rdquo; Salvation here is not salvation from the lake of fire; rather, it refers to what Paul has already said about salvation earlier in this Epistle. The expression <em>so then</em> in verse 12 indicates that what Paul says in this verse is a consequence of what has gone before. Working out our salvation is the result of taking Christ as our pattern, as seen in the preceding verses. As our pattern, Christ is our salvation. However, this salvation needs to be worked out by us.</p>
<p>In order for this to be accomplished in our experience, the pattern must be subjective to us as well as objective. If it were only objective, it could not be the salvation worked out by us. The salvation here is not the salvation we receive; it is the salvation we work out. The salvation we receive is the salvation from God&rsquo;s condemnation and from the lake of fire. There is no need for us to work out that kind of salvation. The salvation in 2:12 is actually a living person. This person is the Christ whom we live, experience, and enjoy. A pattern which is only objective could not be our salvation in this way. The fact that salvation is a living person and that this person is our pattern indicates that the pattern is subjective as well as objective.</p>
<p>Another reason for saying that the pattern is subjective as well as objective is related to the fact that the book of Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ. Anything that is a matter of spiritual experience must be subjective. Based upon this principle and upon the context of the book of Philippians as a whole, Christ as the pattern is not only objective but also subjective and experiential.</p>
<p>Furthermore, following his word about working out our salvation, Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure&rdquo; (v. 13). The word <em>for</em> at the beginning of verse 13 indicates that God&rsquo;s operating in us is related to our working out our own salvation with fear and trembling. God operates in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure. Surely the working in verse 13 refers to the working out in verse 12. We may confess that we are not able to work out our own salvation. Yes, in ourselves we are not able, but God, the One operating in us, is able. Since He is operating in us both the willing and the working, we can work out our own salvation. Paul&rsquo;s word about God operating in us is a further indication that the pattern is subjective as well as objective. Doctrinally, the pattern is objective; experientially, it is subjective.</p>
<p>In Philippians 2 Paul does not charge us to take the objective Christ as our pattern and then imitate Him. Trying to imitate Christ in this way is like a monkey trying to imitate a human being. We should not take verses 5 through 8 out of context. When we consider these verses in context, we see that the pattern is our salvation and that this salvation is God Himself operating in us to save us in a practical way. Although in ourselves we cannot work out our salvation, the One who is able is now operating in us the willing inwardly and the working outwardly. Our responsibility is to cooperate with Him. When we cooperate with God&rsquo;s operation in us, we take Christ as our pattern.</p>
<p>God who operates in us is actually the Spirit of Jesus Christ (1:19). It is only by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ that we can take Christ as our pattern. We need to praise the Lord that the Spirit of Jesus Christ is in us. By the Spirit of Jesus Christ we can be as humble as Jesus was, and by the Spirit of Jesus Christ we can consider one another more excellent than ourselves. When we do things out of rivalry or in competition with others, the Spirit of Jesus Christ is not expressed, but when we consider one another more excellent than ourselves, we enjoy the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Christ as the pattern is in us, living Himself out from within us as the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Christ is not only our pattern but also our life. We have within us a life that never insists on being anything but always empties itself, takes a lower place, and humbles itself. We need to enjoy Christ as such a life within us.</p>
<p>In brief, Christ, the Son of God, had a very high position. He possessed the form of God and had the right to be equal with God. Nevertheless, He did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men. Christ gave up His high standing and took the form not only of a man but also of a slave. Being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient even unto the death of the cross. As such a person, Christ is our pattern for our experience and enjoyment. Instead of seeking a position and title for ourselves, we need to live according to Christ as the pattern of a crucified life. Christ&rsquo;s crucified life should be our experience. We need to experience Christ in His humiliation. This means that we need to experience Him as the One who emptied Himself and humbled Himself.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
 OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(54)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">77. The Goal of the Believers&rsquo; Pursuit</h2>
<p>In Philippians 3:1-16 Christ is presented as the goal of the believers&rsquo; pursuit. Christ must be our goal and our aim. For Christ to be the goal means that He is the highest enjoyment. Our goal is the all-inclusive Christ as the prize awarded to us; when we reach the goal, the goal will immediately become the prize. Paul&rsquo;s pursuit was toward one goal, one aim&mdash;Christ. He took Christ as his goal, pursuing to obtain the prize to which God in Christ had called him upward. Since our goal is to gain Christ, we should forsake all other things and pursue nothing but Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Rejoicing in Him</h2>
<p>In 3:1 Paul says, &ldquo;Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, for me it is not irksome, but for you it is safe.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;irksome&rdquo; also means &ldquo;wearisome, tedious, troublesome.&rdquo; Paul did not find it irksome or wearisome to write the same things to the saints. Paul here charges the saints to rejoice in the Lord. To rejoice in the Lord is a safeguard, a security.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Boasting in Him</h2>
<p>In verse 3 Paul continues, &ldquo;For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.&rdquo; Those who are the circumcision here are the New Testament believers, the ones genuinely circumcised by Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. They are absolutely different from the Judaizers. They serve as priests by the Spirit of God, not by the ordinances of law; they boast in Christ, not in the law; and they have no confidence in the flesh but confidence in the Spirit. In verses 2 and 3 there is a striking contrast between evil workers and believers who boast in Christ. The Judaizers did evil things and even boasted in them, whereas the true believers boast in Christ. They glory and rejoice in Him. As used here, the word <em>boast</em> implies not only boasting but also rejoicing and glorying. Our boasting, glorying, and rejoicing are not in our outward deeds, not in our behavior or conduct, but in Christ alone.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Counting Religious Status in the Flesh<br />
as Loss on Account of Him</h2>
<p>In 3:7 Paul says, &ldquo;What things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ.&rdquo; The expression <em>what things were gains to me</em> refers to Paul&rsquo;s many outstanding qualifications, which would be considered a model of the Judaizers mentioned in verses 5 and 6: &ldquo;Circumcised the eighth day; of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless.&rdquo; The things that were gains to Paul he counted as loss on account of Christ. All the different gains were counted as one loss by Paul because they all issued in one thing, that is, the loss of Christ, as indicated by <em>on account of Christ.</em> All the things that were once gains to Paul hindered him and held him back from participating in Christ and enjoying Him. Hence, on account of Christ all the things that previously were considered gains became a loss to Paul. Like Paul, we should not boast in our religious status; rather, we should count it as loss on account of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Counting Also All Things to Be Loss<br />
on Account of the Excellency of the Knowledge of Him</h2>
<p>In verse 8 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.&rdquo; Paul not only counted as loss on account of Christ the things of his former religion listed in verses 5 and 6, but he also counted all other things as loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. For the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, which he treasured, Paul counted everything as refuse, dregs, rubbish, filth, that which is thrown to the dogs.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Counting All Things to Be Loss</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;all things&rdquo; in verse 8 must certainly include the three categories of religious things, philosophical things, and cultural things. If we would drop our religion, philosophy, and culture, we would truly abandon everything. By dropping these categories of things, we would automatically drop the worldly, material things, which are actually dominated by religion, philosophy, and culture. Although it is easy to overcome the influence of material things, it is very difficult to overcome religion, philosophy, and culture. Those who love the Lord may easily abandon material things for His sake, but it is not easy for them to lay aside their particular thought and logic. You may love the Lord and seek Him for years without dropping one bit of your personal philosophy or logic.</p>
<p>Paul counted the matters of religion, philosophy, and culture as loss because they were all substitutes for Christ, hooks used by Satan to keep people from Christ and from the experience of Christ. How subtle the enemy is in keeping us from the experience of Christ! To some extent at least, we still have within us certain things that are substitutes for Christ in subtle, secret ways. These substitutes mainly involve religion, philosophy, and culture. As a result, we still are not fully and thoroughly occupied by Christ. We have not yet counted all things loss on account of Christ. May the enemy&rsquo;s subtlety be exposed, and may we truly count all things loss, including our own philosophy and logic, on account of Christ and the experience and enjoyment of Him!</p><h2 class="head5">(2) On Account of the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ</h2>
<p>The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is derived from the excellency of His person. The Jews consider the law of God given through Moses the most excellent thing in human history; hence, they are zealous for the law. Paul participated in that zeal. But when Christ was revealed to him by God (Gal. 1:15-16), he saw that the excellency, the supereminence, the supreme preciousness, the surpassing worth, of Christ far exceeded the excellency of the law. His knowledge of Christ issued in the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Since Christ is excellent, the knowledge of Christ is also excellent. On account of this, he counted as loss not only the law and the religion founded according to the law but all things. Like Paul, we should have the knowledge of Christ in His excellency. We should count all things to be loss on account of the excellent knowledge of Christ.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3:7 Paul says, &ldquo;On account of Christ,&rdquo; but in verse 8 he goes further and says, &ldquo;On account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.&rdquo; The addition of the words <em>my Lord</em> indicates that as Paul was writing, he was filled with intimate, tender feelings concerning Christ. Tender feelings concerning the preciousness of the Lord Jesus rose up within him, causing him to speak of &ldquo;Christ Jesus my Lord.&rdquo; Paul placed great value on the excellency of the knowledge of his dear Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>as to,</em> which may be rendered &ldquo;according to,&rdquo; is used three times in verses 5 and 6, with the law, zeal, and righteousness. The phrase <em>on account of,</em> which may be rendered <em>because of,</em> is used three times in verses 7 and 8, with Christ (twice) and with the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Christ stands in contrast to the law, the zeal for it, and the righteousness in it. The excellency of the knowledge of Christ and Christ Himself are in contrast to all things and to the law. On account of Christ and the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, Paul gave up the law, his zeal for it, the righteousness in it, and all other things. This indicates that Christ and the excellency of the knowledge of Christ are far superior to the law and all things.</p>
<p>The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is mentioned in verse 8, whereas the actual experience of Christ is implied in verse 10. The knowledge of Christ, however, is basic. By knowledge we actually mean a revelation, a vision, concerning Christ and His excellence. The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is the excellency of Christ realized by us. If we lack the knowledge of Christ&rsquo;s excellency, His excellency will not mean anything to us. Christ is unlimited; hence, we need to have the excellency of the knowledge of the unlimited Christ, that is, to have a vision of the preciousness of Christ.</p>
<p>When Paul was blind and in religion, he could not see Christ; he could see only the law. Thus, he had the excellency of the knowledge of the law. But after Christ was revealed to him, he began to have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. He was captured by the excellency of knowing Christ, and for the sake of this knowledge, he was willing to drop all things and count them to be loss. If we have more of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, we will drop everything religious and everything natural on account of Him and on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. To Be Found in Him, Having the Righteousness<br />
Which Is out of God and Based on Faith</h2>
<p>In verse 9 we see that Paul&rsquo;s earnest desire was to be found in Christ. Paul had been altogether in the Jewish religion under the law and had always been found by others in the law. But at his conversion he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ and became &ldquo;a man in Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:2). Now he expected to be found in Christ by all who observed him&mdash;the Jews, the angels, and the demons. This indicates that he aspired to have his whole being immersed in and saturated with Christ so that all who observed him might find him fully in Christ. Deep within Paul was the aspiration to be found in Christ. May we all aspire to be found in Christ. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, my desire is to be found in You. In everything I do day by day, I want to be found in You.&rdquo; Only when we are found in Christ will Christ be expressed and magnified (Phil. 1:20).</p>
<p>In 3:9 Paul says that he did not want to have his own righteousness, but he wanted the righteousness which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith. &ldquo;Not having my own righteousness...but...the righteousness which is out of God&rdquo; is the condition in which Paul desired to be found in Christ. He wanted to live not in his own righteousness but in the righteousness of God and to be found in such a transcendent condition, expressing God by living Christ, not by keeping the law.</p>
<p>Before Paul was saved, he had no idea that Christ could be his righteousness. The righteousness of the law is the righteousness which comes from man&rsquo;s own effort to keep the law, as mentioned in verse 6. Formerly, Paul lived in that righteousness, which was according to the law. Others could invariably find him enveloped by the righteousness of the law, but now Paul&rsquo;s desire was to be observed as a person living in Christ and having Christ as his righteousness.</p>
<p>The righteousness in which Paul wanted to be found was the righteousness &ldquo;which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith.&rdquo; The expression <em>faith in Christ</em> literally means &ldquo;faith of Christ&rdquo;; it implies our believing in Christ. The faith with which we believe in Christ issues from our knowing and appreciating Christ. It is Christ Himself, infused into us through our appreciation of Him, who becomes our faith&mdash;the faith in Him. Hence, it is the faith of Christ that brings us into an organic union with Him.</p>
<p>The righteousness which is out of God and based on faith is the righteousness that is God Himself lived out of us to be our righteousness through our faith in Christ. Such righteousness is the expression of God, who lives in us. It is based on faith because it is on the basis, or condition, of faith. Faith is the basis, the condition, for us to receive and possess the righteousness that is out of God, the highest righteousness, which is Christ (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>From the word of life and through the supply of the Spirit, Paul obtained faith. This faith brought him God&rsquo;s infusion. Spontaneously, Paul lived God out as his daily living and could be found in Christ, having the righteousness of God. When we experientially have the supply of the Spirit (Phil. 1:19) through the word of life (2:16) issuing in the faith of Christ (3:9), we are infused with God Himself (Rom. 10:17). Then the God who has been infused into us becomes our daily living, the living which Paul describes as the righteousness of God. This is to be found in Christ under the condition of enjoying God&rsquo;s infusion so that we may live Him out through the supply of the Spirit, the word of life, and the righteousness of God through faith.</p>
<p>If we are truly found in Christ, all other things will lose their hold on us. We will no longer be under the influence of religion, philosophy, or culture. When we are found in Him, religion, philosophy, and culture are annulled. To be found in Christ means that He is our unique expression. Because Paul could be found in Christ, Christ was his expression. In every aspect and from every angle, only Christ could be seen upon him. Paul&rsquo;s aspiration was that Christ would be his only expression. He did not want to be found in such natural virtues as humility, patience, and love. These were among the things that he counted as refuse in order to gain Christ and be found in Him. Culture, human patience, natural love, and submission&mdash;all are refuse when compared to Christ. We should not aspire to be found in our own love for others or in our natural submission. Our earnest desire should be to be found only in Christ.</p>
<p>We all need to bow down before the Lord and pray: &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me. Cause Paul&rsquo;s aspiration to become my aspiration also. O Lord, create in me the hunger and thirst to pursue after You that I may be found in You. I don&rsquo;t want others to find me in anything other than You. I want to be a person wholly in You, and I want others to find me in You.&rdquo; May the Lord grant us mercy that we may be found in Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(55)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the goal of the believers&rsquo; pursuit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. To Know Him and the Power of His Resurrection<br />
and the Fellowship of His Sufferings,<br />
Being Conformed to His Death</h2>
<p>Philippians 3:10 says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; Paul lived in a condition of having not his own righteousness but the righteousness that is out of God (v. 9), in order to know (to experience) Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) To Know Christ</h2>
<p>In verse 8 to have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is by revelation. But to know Him in verse 10 is by experience&mdash;to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him. Paul first received the revelation of Christ, then sought the experience of Christ&mdash;to know and enjoy Christ in an experiential way.</p>
<p>To know Christ is not merely to have the knowledge concerning Him but to gain His person (2 Cor. 2:10). To gain something requires the paying of a price; to gain Christ is to experience, enjoy, and take possession of all His unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8) by paying a price. Christ has gained us, taken possession of us, that we might gain Him, take possession of Him (Phil. 3:12).</p>
<p>We need to know Christ by enjoying Him, experiencing Him, being one with Him, and having Him live within us and walk with us. In this way we know Him by both revelation and experience. Eventually, He becomes us, and we become Him.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) To Know the Power of His Resurrection</h2>
<p>The power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is His resurrection life, which raised Him from the dead (Eph. 1:19-20). The reality of the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is the Spirit (Rom. 1:4). To know, to experience, this power requires identification with Christ&rsquo;s death and conformity to it. Death is the base of resurrection. To experience the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, we need to live a crucified life, as He did. Our conformity to His death affords the power of His resurrection a base from which to rise up that His divine life may be expressed in us.</p>
<p>Although it is wonderful to enjoy the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the power of resurrection is not mainly for our enjoyment. In God&rsquo;s economy there is no selfish enjoyment. The power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is for the producing and building up of the Body. If we put ourselves aside and remain under the death of the cross, we will enjoy the power of resurrection. Spontaneously, the power of resurrection experienced by us will produce the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) To Know the Fellowship of His Sufferings</h2>
<p>The expression <em>the fellowship of His sufferings</em> in verse 10 refers to the participation in Christ&rsquo;s sufferings (Matt. 20:22-23; Col. 1:24), a necessary condition for the experience of the power of His resurrection (2 Tim. 2:11) by being conformed to His death. Paul was pursuing to know and experience not only the excellency of Christ Himself but also the life power of His resurrection and the participation in His sufferings. With Christ, the sufferings and death came first, followed by the resurrection; with us, the power of His resurrection comes first, followed by the participation in His sufferings and conformity to His death. We first receive the power of His resurrection; then by this power we are enabled to participate in His sufferings and live a crucified life in conformity to His death. Such sufferings are mainly for producing and building up the Body of Christ (Col. 1:24).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s sufferings are of two categories: those for accomplishing redemption, which were completed by Christ Himself, and those for producing and building the church, which need to be filled up by the apostles and the believers (v. 24). We cannot participate in Christ&rsquo;s suffering for redemption, but we must take part in the sufferings of Christ for the producing and building up of the Body (cf. Rev. 1:9; 2 Tim. 2:10; 2 Cor. 1:5-6; 4:12; 6:8-11). Christ as the Lamb of God suffered for redemption (John 1:29); Christ as the grain of wheat suffered for reproducing and building (12:24). The Lord, as a grain of wheat that fell into the ground, lost His soul-life through death that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains (10:10-11). The one grain did not complete all the sufferings that are needed for the building up of the Body; as the many grains, we must suffer in the same way the one grain suffered (12:24-26). As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy eternal life in resurrection (v. 25). This is to follow Him that we may serve Him and walk with Him on the way of losing the soul-life and living in resurrection (v. 26). The way for the church to come into being and to increase is not by human glory but by the death of the cross.</p><h2 class="head5">(4) Being Conformed to His Death</h2>
<p>In Philippians 3:10 Paul spoke of &ldquo;being conformed to His death.&rdquo; This expression indicates that Paul desired to take Christ&rsquo;s death as the mold of his life. The excellency of the knowledge of Christ, counting all things as loss, gaining Christ, being found in Him, knowing Him, knowing the power of His resurrection, and knowing the fellowship of His sufferings all issue in one thing&mdash;being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Paul lived a crucified life continually, a life under the cross, just as Christ did in His human living. Through such a life of being molded to Christ&rsquo;s death, Paul experienced and enjoyed the resurrection power of Christ. The mold of Christ&rsquo;s death refers to Christ&rsquo;s experience of continually putting to death His human life that He might live by the life of God (John 6:57). When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived a crucified life. By living a crucified life He was alive to God and lived Him. He always put His human life to death so that the divine life within Him could flow out (10:10-11, 17). As He was living, He was also dying&mdash;dying to the old creation in order to live a life in the new creation. This is the meaning of &ldquo;His death&rdquo; in Philippians 3:10.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s death is a mold to which we are conformed in much the same way that dough is put into a cake mold and conformed to it. God has put us into the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death, and day by day God is molding us to conform us to this death (Rom. 6:3-4). We should be conformed to such a mold by our dying to our human life to live the divine life. If we put to death our natural life, we will have the consciousness that we have another life, the divine life, within us; this life will be released, and then in our experience we will be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death (John 10:10; 1 John 5:11-12). In the mold of Christ&rsquo;s death, the natural life is killed, the old man is crucified, and the self is nullified (2 Cor. 4:16; Rom. 6:6; Matt. 16:24). If we allow our circumstances to press us into this mold, our daily life will be molded into the form of Christ&rsquo;s death (Rom. 8:28-29).</p>
<p>Being conformed to the death of Christ is the condition for knowing and experiencing Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings. Being conformed to the death of Christ is the base of the experience of Christ. As we are conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, we experience His all-accomplishing death. First, if we die with Christ, we will keep our soul-life unto eternal life (John 12:25). Second, if we are willing to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, we will overcome the world and defeat Satan (v. 31; Heb. 2:14). Third, by being conformed to His death, we experience Christ in His death for the release, impartation, and multiplication of life (John 12:24-26; 2 Cor. 4:12). We need to be conformed to the death of Christ so that the divine life within us may be released and imparted into others and thereby multiplied. Fourth, when we are conformed to the death of Christ, spontaneously the divine life within us will be released, and God the Father, the source of this life, will be glorified. Hence, the more we are conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, the more we glorify the Father (John 12:28; 13:31). The only way to glorify God is to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death. Fifth, through His death on the cross, people are drawn to Christ (12:32). The real attraction is in His dying. When we die the death of Christ and are conformed to His death, we will be a magnet drawing others to Christ. The death of Christ on the cross has a lovable attraction. Such an attraction comes through the release of life; this is the crucified life with its attracting power.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. That We May Attain to<br />
the Out-resurrection from the Dead</h2>
<p>In Philippians 3:11 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.&rdquo; To attain means to arrive at. To attain to the out-resurrection from the dead requires us to run triumphantly the race for the prize (1 Cor. 9:24-26; 2 Tim. 4:7-8). The out-resurrection refers to the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints (Heb. 11:35; Rev. 20:4-6). All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from the dead at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:52), but the overcoming saints will enjoy an extra, outstanding portion of that resurrection.</p>
<p>To arrive at the out-resurrection indicates that our entire being has been gradually and continually resurrected. God first resurrected our deadened spirit (Eph. 2:5-6). Then from our spirit He proceeds to resurrect our soul (Rom. 8:6) and our mortal body (v. 11), until our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;is fully resurrected out of our old being by and with His life. This is a process in life through which we must pass and a race that we must run until we arrive at the out-resurrection as the prize. Hence, the out-resurrection should be the goal and destination of our Christian life. We can reach this goal only by being conformed to the death of Christ, by living a crucified life. In the death of Christ we are processed in resurrection from the old creation to the new.</p>
<p>To be in the out-resurrection means to leave everything of the old creation and to be brought into God. Although Lazarus was resurrected, he neither left the things of the old creation nor was he brought into God. At the end of the coming age all the dead unbelievers will be resurrected. Nevertheless, that resurrection will not bring them out of the old creation, and it will not bring them into God. There is only one kind of resurrection that brings us out of the old creation and into God, and this is the resurrection of Christ. Thus, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is the outstanding resurrection. Christ is the unique One to pass out of the old creation and to enter into God. Christ lived in an old creation body and environment for thirty-three and a half years, but the life He lived belonged wholly to the new creation because He continually died to His old creation body and environment and lived to God. Through His death and resurrection, He left the old creation behind and was brought into God.</p>
<p>The out-resurrection is actually the dear, precious, excellent person of Christ, the One who, through crucifixion and resurrection, has passed out of the old creation and has entered into God. This wonderful One is far more excellent than the angels, who belong to the old creation. They have not experienced crucifixion or resurrection. But after Christ was crucified and buried, He was resurrected out of the old creation and into God. Christ Himself is the reality of the out-resurrection. Now we must pursue a life which is this wonderful person of Christ. With Paul, we should be able to say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). Paul could also testify that he had been crucified with Christ and that Christ lived in him (Gal. 2:20). The Christ who lived in Paul is the One who, in His own person, is the out-resurrection.</p>
<p>Now we need to ask an important question: Can we reach the goal of the out-resurrection in this age, or can we only run the race and hope to reach the goal in the coming age? Some may think that we must wait until the coming age to reach the goal. But if we do not arrive at the goal in this age, we will not attain to it in the next age. We must endeavor to arrive at the goal during our lifetime.</p>
<p>In Romans 8:11 Paul says, &ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; This verse indicates that we can attain to the out-resurrection in this age. Here Paul says that the Spirit of the One who raised Christ from the dead will give life to that part of our being which is dying, our mortal bodies. We have seen that the Spirit is the reality of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the reality of the out-resurrection. The Spirit is dwelling in us to work the out-resurrection into our being in a real and practical way. Thus, Romans 8:11 indicates that we should attain to the out-resurrection in this age.</p>
<p>To live Christ is to live the out-resurrection; this should be our goal. Day by day we should live the out-resurrection. For example, our love for our spouse should not be natural but in resurrection. If we love our spouse in resurrection, our love will be not of the old creation but in God. Our deeds and words must be in resurrection. If a certain deed is not in resurrection, we should not do it. If a certain word is not in resurrection, we should not say it. The question is not whether a particular thing is right or wrong but whether or not it is in resurrection. This shows that to live Christ is to live the out-resurrection, to live a life absolutely outside of the old creation and in God.</p>
<p>In the out-resurrection there is no element of the old creation. Instead, everything is full of the divine element. This is the reason that people sense God when they are with a person who lives in the out-resurrection. The living of such a person, his deeds and words, is in resurrection. This is the out-resurrection in our daily life. In Philippians 3 Paul was pursuing this kind of living. This is what he had in mind when he declared that his desire was to know Christ and the power of His resurrection and by any means to attain to the out-resurrection. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You in a way that I have never loved You before. Lord, in Your presence I resolve to pursue You as the out-resurrection. I want everything in my life to be outside of the old creation and in God.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head4">h. Forgetting the Things Behind and Stretching Forward to the Things Before to Pursue toward the Goal<br />
for the Prize of the High Calling of God in Him</h2>
<p>In Philippians 3:13 Paul says, &ldquo;Brothers, I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before.&rdquo; Paul had experienced and gained Christ tremendously, yet he did not account of himself to have experienced Christ in full or to have gained Him to the uttermost. He still endeavored to pursue toward the goal&mdash;the gaining of Christ to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>In verse 13 Paul speaks of forgetting the things which are behind. In order to gain Christ to the fullest extent, Paul not only forsook his experiences in Judaism but also would not linger in his past experiences of Christ. He forgot the past. Not to forget but to linger in our past experiences, however genuine they were, frustrates our further pursuing of Christ.</p>
<p>Paul also tells us that he was stretching forward to the things which are before. He knew that Christ is unsearchably rich, that there is a vast territory of His riches to be possessed. He was stretching forward to gain these riches and to advance further into this territory.</p>
<p>Even though Paul was a matured saint and an experienced apostle, he tells us that he had not already obtained and had not yet been perfected. He did not regard himself as one who had obtained the full enjoyment of Christ or the full maturity in life. He, of course, had obtained the common salvation by the common faith (1 Tim. 1:14-16), but he was still pursuing Christ in order to gain Him to the fullest extent. Furthermore, Paul was also seeking Christ in order to have the extra portion of resurrection, the out-resurrection. In order to have this portion of resurrection, we must pursue, run the race, and finish our course triumphantly. Like Paul, we have been regenerated, but we are not yet perfected, or matured, in life. At the time of our conversion, we were gained by Christ so that we may gain Him. Now as those who have not yet obtained and who have not yet been perfected, we are pursuing Christ.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3:14 Paul declares, &ldquo;I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward.&rdquo; Paul was pursuing toward the goal for the prize. Christ is both the goal and the prize. The goal is the fullest enjoyment and gaining of Christ, and the prize is the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race. In order to reach the goal for the prize, Paul was exercised to forget the things which are behind and to stretch forward to the things which are before. This is the way to gain Christ by pursuing Him.</p>
<p>To be called upward is for the obtaining of the prize to which God has called us from above, from the heavens. This heavenly calling (Heb. 3:1) corresponds with the heavenly commonwealth in Philippians 3:20. It is not an earthly calling like that given to the children of Israel in the flesh. This upward calling is to take possession of Christ, whereas the earthly calling to the children of Israel was to take possession of the physical land.</p>
<p>We should see the fact that God has set up a goal and prepared a prize. We need to run a good race and to pursue Christ by forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, that is, the things concerning Christ and His Body, the church. Let us all forget the things behind and pay attention to the bright future ahead of us, a future of gaining Christ and experiencing Him to the uttermost in His Body.</p>
<p>We should not be satisfied simply with Bible knowledge, not even with the knowledge of Philippians 3. We need to have the actual pursuing of Christ. The Greek word for <em>pursue</em> can also be translated &ldquo;persecute.&rdquo; Before Paul was saved, he was persecuting Christ in a negative way. After he was saved, he pursued Christ to such an extent that we may even say he persecuted Christ but in a very positive way. To persecute a person is to trouble him and refuse to let him go. Before Paul was saved, he bothered Christ and would not let Him go, persecuting Him negatively. But after he was saved and had been gained by Christ, Paul still persecuted Him, but positively, for he refused to let Christ go. We also should persecute Christ in this way in order to gain Him. We should not let Christ go; rather, we should bother Him, persecute Him, in order to gain Him. This is to pursue Christ.</p>
<p>To persecute Christ in this way is exhausting. As we persecute Christ, we should spend ourselves completely. Our whole being with all of our strength should be consumed in pursuing Christ. We need to be stirred up to seek Him, even in a persecuting way. We should not allow Christ to get away from us. Instead, we should seek Him, pursue Him, and persecute Him in such a positive way; then we will gain Him.</p>
<p>In verse 15 Paul says, &ldquo;Let us therefore, as many as are full-grown, have this mind; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you.&rdquo; In this book the dealing with the Philippian believers is focused on the mind, the leading part of the soul. This book charges them to strive together with one soul along with the personified gospel (1:27), to think the same thing, to be joined in soul, even to think the one thing (2:2; 4:2), to let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be in them (2:5), and to have this one mind, a mind focused on the pursuing and gaining of Christ to the uttermost. When our mind is thus occupied, we have the same mind, thinking the same thing, even thinking the one thing&mdash;the fullest gaining of Christ&mdash;being joined in soul, like-souled (v. 20), and made one soul.</p>
<p>The pursuing of Christ must be our goal. We should not be otherwise minded. God reveals to us that we need such a mind, a mind focused on the pursuing of Christ. Thus, God desires to continually adjust our mind, turning it toward Christ as the center.</p>
<p>We all need to see God&rsquo;s unique goal. It is easy to be distracted in the Christian life, for there are many distracting factors surrounding us. If we do not have a fixed goal, the unique goal, the goal set up by God in eternity, and hold to it, we will eventually be distracted. The only thing that can keep us on God&rsquo;s way is His unique goal&mdash;Christ for our highest enjoyment and ultimate gain. If we take this goal as our ultimate goal, we will be preserved.</p>
<p>In 3:16, Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Nevertheless whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>walk</em> is <em>stoicheo,</em> meaning to walk orderly, derived from <em>steicho,</em> which means to march in military rank, to keep step, to conform to virtue and piety. The word is also used in Romans 4:12 and Galatians 5:25 and 6:16. By this word the apostle charged us to walk and to order our lives&mdash;whereunto we have attained, at the state to which we have attained&mdash;by the same rule, in the same line, in the same path, in the same footsteps. Whatever state we have attained to in our spiritual life, we all must walk, as the apostle did, by the same rule, in the same path; that is, we must pursue Christ, toward the goal that we may gain Christ to the fullest extent as the prize of the upward calling of God.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s main thought in Philippians 3:16 is that, as Christians, the most important principle of our Christian life should be to pursue Christ. This principle must become a basic and governing element in our Christian walk. The governing principle of our Christian life should be the pursuing after the enjoyment and experience of Christ. This principle will preserve us in the proper oneness. May the Lord have mercy on us that we would have a mind to pursue Christ to the uttermost and to walk according to the elementary principle of the Christian life. This principle is that we pursue Christ, forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the goal established by God, that we may obtain the prize that He has prepared for us.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(56)</h1>
<p>Philippians 1 through 3 reveals our progressive experience of Christ. In chapter 1 to experience Christ is a matter of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. No doubt, this is a matter of our experience of Christ as the Spirit of Jesus Christ in our spirit (v. 19). In chapter 2 our experience of Christ is a matter related to our mind. In verse 5 Paul tells us that our mind should be indwelt by Christ&rsquo;s mind. Thinking the same thing and doing all things without murmurings and especially reasonings are matters in our mind (vv. 2, 14). In chapter 3, as we will see in this message, to experience Christ in the final state is to experience Him in our body. Our experience of Christ in our body, that is, the transfiguration, the redemption, of our body, will be the consummation of the experience of Christ (v. 21). This will be the conformation of our natural body to the heavenly form of the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. Our entire being will be brought into glory by experiencing Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">78. The One Who Transfigures Our Body</h2>
<p>In 3:20-21 Christ is revealed as the One who transfigures our body. The life which Paul lived in the experience of Christ was that of eagerly awaiting the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who would come from the heavens to transfigure his body of humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory. Thus, he took the Christ whom he experienced as his expectation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. To Come from the Heavens</h2>
<p>In verse 20 Paul says, &ldquo;Our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This verse indicates that Christ who transfigures our body will come from the heavens. We are waiting for Christ to come back so that we may be brought into the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;the transfiguration of our body. As we await and love the Lord&rsquo;s glorious appearing from the heavens, we should live a God-expressing and flesh-restricting life (Titus 2:12-13; Luke 21:34-36; 2 Tim. 4:8).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Transfiguring the Body of Our Humiliation, Conforming It to the Body of His Glory</h2>
<p>According to Philippians 3:20-21, from the heavens we are eagerly awaiting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, &ldquo;who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory.&rdquo; The transfiguration of our body is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s salvation. In His salvation God first regenerated our spirit (John 3:6), now is transforming our soul (Rom. 12:2), and consummately will transfigure our body, making us the same as Christ in all three parts of our being.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3:21 Paul refers to our body as &ldquo;the body of our humiliation.&rdquo; This describes our natural body, made of worthless dust (Gen. 2:7) and damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death (Rom. 6:6; 7:24; 8:11). But one day this body will be transfigured and conformed to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. Christ&rsquo;s body of glory is His resurrected body, saturated with God&rsquo;s glory (Luke 24:26) and transcendent over corruption and death (Rom. 6:9).</p>
<p>Our spirit has been regenerated, and our soul may be fully transformed, yet our body remains old. With all its physical weakness and illnesses, it is under the power of death. It is mortal and subject to infirmity and death. Though our body may be enlivened by the Spirit who indwells us (8:11), it is a mortal body, subject to death and needing to be redeemed. Today, by cooperating with the Spirit in our spirit, we may experience the Lord&rsquo;s spreading of the divine life into our body to enliven and even saturate it to a certain degree. Nevertheless, no matter how much our body may be enlivened and saturated by the Spirit, it still requires the Lord&rsquo;s full redemption. This is the reason we often groan in ourselves (v. 23). But we praise the Lord that when He comes back, He will transfigure the body of our humiliation. Then &ldquo;we will be like Him&rdquo; (1 John 3:2), not only in our spirit and in our soul but also in our body. At that time we will be in His full likeness both inwardly and outwardly, from the center of our being to the circumference, from our innermost spirit to our outermost body. That will be the ultimate consummation of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>The transfiguration of our body is the redemption of our body for the full sonship of God (Rom. 8:23). Although we have the divine Spirit as the firstfruits in our spirit, our body has not yet been saturated with the divine life. Our body is still the flesh, linked to the old creation, and it is still a body of sin and death that is impotent in the things of God (6:6; 7:24). Hence, we groan together with the creation and eagerly await the glorious day when we will obtain the full sonship, the redemption and transfiguration of our body (8:19-23).</p>
<p>The transfiguration of our body will be the glorification of our entire being (vv. 30, 17; 1 Pet. 5:10; 2 Tim. 2:10). Objectively, glorification is that the redeemed believers will be brought into the glory of God (Heb. 2:10a; 1 Pet. 5:10a). Subjectively, glorification is that the matured believers will manifest from within them, by their maturity in life, the glory of God as the element of their maturity in life (Rom. 8:17-18, 21; 2 Cor. 4:17). The Lord is in us as the hope of glory to bring us into glory. At His coming back, on the one hand, He will come from the heavens with glory (Rev. 10:1; Matt. 25:31), and on the other hand, He will be glorified in His saints (2 Thes. 1:10). His glory will be manifested from within His members, causing their body of humiliation to be transfigured into and conformed to the body of His glory (Phil. 3:21). Thus, the unbelievers will marvel, admire, wonder at, the One who is in us, the believers. We are on the way of being brought into glory by the sanctifying work of the Spirit; sanctification is the gradual process of glorification (Heb. 2:10-11; 1 Thes. 5:23; Eph. 5:26-27).</p>
<p>The reality of our glorification is our gaining of God Himself, for the glory of God is God Himself (Jer. 2:11; Eph. 1:17; 1 Cor. 2:8; 1 Pet. 4:14), and the manifestation of God is the glory of God (Acts 7:2). Without God, we do not have glory. When we gain God, we are glorified. The measure of God that we have determines the measure of our glory. The believers&rsquo; entering into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God is their entering into God to enjoy God Himself. The more we enjoy God and the more of God we have in us, the more we have His glory. As we enjoy God, we manifest the glory of God, glorifying God, and God is expressed through us.</p>
<p>The believers&rsquo; transformation in the divine life today is God&rsquo;s expression in the believers&rsquo; glory. Hence, this daily transformation is from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18; 4:17). The subjective glory of God in us, the expression of God in us, is a glory that progresses from one degree to another. The consummation of glory into which the believers will enter by transformation in life is that they will be glorified; their body will be redeemed, and they will thereby enter into the glory of God to fully enjoy God as glory (Rom. 8:21, 23, 30). The believers&rsquo; arriving at glorification is the climax of their maturity in the life of God and the climax of God&rsquo;s salvation in life (Heb. 6:1a; Rom. 5:10). Glorification is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s salvation in life; it is God&rsquo;s salvation in life saving us to the uttermost through regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</p>
<p>We were made according to Christ, who is the image of God (Gen. 1:26; Col. 1:15). One day Christ came in the form of a man (Phil. 2:7-8). Through death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit in order to dispense Himself into us (1 Cor. 15:45). We received Him, and He came into us. This Christ is now within us doing the work of transformation, not only transforming us into His image but also conforming us into His form. Eventually, He will come to transfigure our body into the likeness of His glorious body. Then we will be fully, completely, and ultimately the same as He is (1 John 3:2b). We will be like Christ, and He will be fully like us. Christ and we will be in the same image and in the same likeness. This was God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man to express God Himself. This is God&rsquo;s desire and His heart&rsquo;s delight, and this is also what God is waiting for in His good pleasure (Eph. 1:5). Therefore, the transfiguration of our body, the glorification of our entire being, is the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy for the satisfaction of God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. According to the Operation of God, Who Is Able<br />
Even to Subject All Things to Himself</h2>
<p>In verse 21 of Philippians 3 Paul says that the transfiguration of the body of our humiliation is &ldquo;according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.&rdquo; The transfiguring of our body is accomplished by the Lord&rsquo;s great power, which subjects all things to Himself (Eph. 1:19-22). This is the almighty power in the universe.</p>
<p>In summary, the transfiguration of our body indicated in Philippians 3:21 is the redemption of our body mentioned in Romans 8:23; this is the final step of Christ&rsquo;s redemption applied to our being. The transfiguration of our body is our hope of glory, for which we are eagerly awaiting. First, we were regenerated in our spirit; now we are being transformed in our soul; eventually we will be transfigured in our body. Thus, in our tripartite being, we will be absolutely the same as Christ is. He is the firstborn Son of God, and we will be conformed to His image to be the many full-grown sons of God, who are the many brothers of Christ and the members of the Body of Christ, the corporate expression of the Triune God (v. 29; 12:4-5).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(57)</h1>
<p>Philippians presents marvelous aspects of Christ for our experience and enjoyment. In chapter 1 Christ is the life for us to live, in chapter 2 Christ is the pattern for us to follow, and in chapter 3 Christ is the goal and the prize for us to pursue. In this message, we will cover chapter 4 where Christ is the secret and the power for us to enjoy.</p>
<h2 class="head3">79. The One Who Empowers Us</h2>
<p>Philippians 4:1-19 reveals Christ as the One who empowers us. This is a very precious aspect of Christ for our experience and enjoyment. The Greek word for <em>empowers</em> is a verb form of the noun <em>dunamis,</em> which means &ldquo;motivating power, or strength.&rdquo; This indicates that in Christ as the motivating strength that empowers us all the time, we can do all the things that pertain to our experience of Christ as revealed in Philippians 4, including standing firm in Christ, rejoicing in Him always, letting the peace of God guard our hearts and thoughts in Christ, being content through Him as the secret, and having God fill our every need in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Standing Firm in Him</h2>
<p>In 4:1 Paul charges the believers: &ldquo;In the same way stand firm in the Lord.&rdquo; The expression <em>in the same way stand</em> means to stand in a particular way, in the way presented in the foregoing chapters. In this verse Paul was urging the believers in Philippi to stand in the way that he had shown them.</p>
<p>In chapter 3 Paul says that he aspires to be found in Christ. In 4:1 he tells us to stand firm in the Lord. Standing firm in the Lord is the key to letting our forbearance be known to all men (v. 5). If we do not stand firm in the Lord, there is no way to make our forbearance known. In order to do anything, we must have a proper standing. This is true of making known our forbearance. Therefore, in order to make our forbearance known, we must stand firm in the Lord; that is, we must remain in Him. Hence, Paul&rsquo;s word about standing firm in the Lord is equal to the Lord&rsquo;s word about abiding in Him (John 15:4).</p>
<p>In Philippians 4:2 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord.&rdquo; As those who stand firm in the Lord, we should also &ldquo;think the same thing in the Lord.&rdquo; Apart from the Lord, we cannot think the same thing. If we would think the same thing in the Lord, we must first stand firm in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Rejoicing in Him Always</h2>
<p>In verse 4 Paul says, &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.&rdquo; All believers need to rejoice in the Lord. Those who do not rejoice are wrong, and those who do rejoice are right. According to Paul&rsquo;s word here, we should rejoice in the Lord always. This rejoicing affords us the strength for the oneness spoken of in verses 2 and 3&mdash;thinking the same thing in the Lord and contending together in the gospel. If believers are to think the same thing, it is necessary for them to learn to rejoice. Rejoicing in the Lord is also the secret of having the excellent characteristics listed in verses 5 through 9, including forbearance and other praiseworthy virtues. If we would have the virtues found in these verses, we need to rejoice in the Lord. Therefore, rejoicing in the Lord is important.</p>
<p>Moreover, Paul emphasizes this point by opening verse 10 with the words, &ldquo;But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly.&rdquo; Moreover, in 1:18 Paul, speaking of his affliction, says, &ldquo;What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truthfulness, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice; yes, and I will rejoice.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s word about rejoicing is especially significant when we consider his circumstances. He was a prisoner in Rome, and certain of his opposers were doing everything possible to damage his ministry. Nevertheless, Paul declares, &ldquo;I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (v. 19). As we have pointed out previously, <em>salvation</em> here means to magnify Christ by living Him. Thus, Paul says, &ldquo;According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death&rdquo; (v. 20). Paul did not expect to be put to shame in anything. No matter how difficult his circumstances were, he did not have any anxiety. Because Paul was not anxious in anything, he was not put to shame in anything. Instead, Christ was magnified in him. Even during his imprisonment, Paul could magnify Christ because he had a great deal of forbearance.</p>
<p>Forbearance is related to rejoicing in the Lord. In 4:4 Paul says, &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord always.&rdquo; Immediately after this he says, &ldquo;Let your forbearance be known to all men&rdquo; (v. 5). If we do not rejoice in the Lord, we will not be able to forbear. If we would make known our forbearance, we need to be happy and joyful in the Lord. Those who are sad or sorrowful cannot have forbearance. Instead, they find it easy to be upset, to complain, or to lose their temper. The forbearance in verse 5 is the issue, the result, of the rejoicing in the Lord mentioned in verse 4. From experience we know that rejoicing and forbearing go together.</p>
<p>To rejoice in the Lord is to be one with Him. When we are one with the Lord, we are not anxious about anything, for we are not only under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign hand but also in the Lord Himself. If we live this kind of life, how could we be anxious? The more we practice being one with the Lord, the more we will realize that His destiny is our destiny. If He wants us to stay on earth for a longer period of time, He will keep us alive. But if it is His desire that we go to Him, He will take us to Himself. Since everything depends on His will and since we are one with Him in a practical way, there is no reason for us to be anxious.</p>
<p>When we are separated from the Lord, we are anxious about everything. Everything in human life gives rise to anxiety, but when we are one with the Lord, we are separated from the natural human life and its anxiety. If we would make our forbearance known to all men and not be anxious in anything, we need to practice being one with the Lord. This is the reason Paul charges us to rejoice in the Lord before he exhorts us to make known our forbearance.</p>
<p>Even though Paul was a prisoner in Rome, he was not anxious about anything, because he was one with the Lord actually, practically, and thoroughly. He could even say that to die was better than to live. Paul was so one with the Lord that he knew that the Lord was his destiny. Not only was Paul&rsquo;s destiny in the hand of the Lord&mdash;his destiny was the Lord Himself. Because Paul was one with the Lord, he knew that Satan could not do anything to him, even though he might send a messenger, a thorn in the flesh, to buffet him (2 Cor. 12:7). Paul was not worried about what Satan might do, for the Lord was his destiny.</p>
<p>Paul had learned the secret of being able to do all things in the One who empowered him (Phil. 4:13). In verse 4 he exhorts us to rejoice in the Lord always. We may think that it is easy to rejoice in the Lord. Actually, rejoicing in Him requires the out-resurrection. In order to rejoice in the Lord, we need to be in Him as the One who empowers us.</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Peace of God Guarding<br />
Our Hearts and Our Thoughts in Him</h2>
<p>In verse 7 Paul goes on to say that &ldquo;the peace of God, which surpasses every man&rsquo;s understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;guard&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;mount guard over.&rdquo; The God of peace patrols or stands guard before our hearts and thoughts in Christ. The heart is the source; the thoughts are the issue. The peace of God guards both our hearts and our thoughts. This means that in Christ Jesus the peace of God patrols our hearts and our thoughts, keeping us calm and tranquil. Even though we may have many troubles and much anxiety, nothing will disturb us. The peace of God infused into us through His dispensing keeps us calm.</p>
<p>In our prayer to God there must be the essence of worship and fellowship, and there must also be petitions for particular needs. Even if we do not have specific needs, we still need a time of prayer day by day to worship the Lord and have fellowship with Him. As we worship the Lord and have fellowship with Him in prayer, we enjoy communion with Him and practice the organic union with Him.</p>
<p>The issue, the result, of practicing the organic union with the Lord is that the peace of God guards our hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus. The peace of God is actually God as peace (v. 9) infused into us through our fellowship with Him by prayer. This peace is the counterpoise to troubles and the antidote to anxiety (John 16:33).</p>
<p>Bad news or difficult situations may cause us to worry or be anxious. We find the antidote to this anxiety when we pray, practice communion with God, and enjoy the organic union. Then spontaneously, even unconsciously, the peace of God is transfused into our inner being. This transfused peace becomes the counterpoise to troubles and becomes the antidote to anxiety. From experience we know that through prayer we receive this antidote to anxiety when the peace of God is infused into us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. To Be Content through Him as the Secret</h2>
<p>In Philippians 4:11 Paul says, &ldquo;Not that I speak according to lack, for I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content.&rdquo; This verse indicates that Paul had learned to be content in all circumstances. The word <em>content</em> means &ldquo;self-sufficient, satisfied in oneself.&rdquo; This is a word used by the Stoics, who taught that a person should be content in all circumstances.</p>
<p>In verse 12 Paul continues, &ldquo;I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack.&rdquo; The phrase <em>I have learned the secret</em> is an interpretation of the Greek word which literally means &ldquo;I have been initiated.&rdquo; The metaphor here refers to a person&rsquo;s being initiated into a secret society with instruction in its rudimentary principles. After Paul was converted to Christ, he was initiated into Christ and the Body of Christ. He then learned the secret of how to take Christ as life, how to live Christ, how to magnify Christ, how to gain Christ, and how to have the church life, all of which things are rudimentary principles. The secret of the Body is to take Christ as our life, to live Christ, to pursue Christ, to gain Christ, to magnify Christ, and to express Christ. These are the basic principles of the church, the Body of Christ. As one who had been initiated into the Body, Paul learned the secret.</p>
<p>Christ is our secret and power. When we live by this secret and power, we can solve whatever matter comes to us. Because we know the secret, we do not care whether we are rich or poor or whether we are abased or abound. Because Christ is our secret, we know how to face any kind of situation. Whether people honor us or despise us, we know the secret and have the power.</p>
<p>Paul learned the secret of sufficiency in Christ. When he was in want and was tempted to worry about his situation, he applied the secret. Then, in his experience, this secret eliminated his worry. Therefore, he could have the boldness to testify that he knew both how to be abased and how to abound. The fact that Paul knew how to be abased indicates that he experienced feelings of abasement. He knew what it was to have worry and anxiety in times of suffering, but at those times he applied the secret of the indwelling Christ. Paul was a person in Christ, and he experienced Christ and applied Him in all his circumstances. Paul could be content because he applied the Christ in whom he lived and in whom he remained. This Christ is real, living, near, available, and prevailing. This Christ became Paul&rsquo;s secret.</p>
<p>In Philippians, a book that speaks about Paul&rsquo;s circumstances, we see the secret of the Christian life and the practical way for the church life, that is, the indwelling Christ. No matter what the circumstances are, we have a wonderful person living within us who bears all our burdens. We need to learn to turn to Christ, take Him as our person, and let Him replace us. All our circumstances teach us to learn the secret of living by Christ; all our circumstances force us to give up ourselves and take Christ as our person. This is the main lesson of this Epistle.</p><h2 class="head4">e. Being Able to Do All Things in Him</h2>
<p>In verse 13 we find a basic principle related to the apostle&rsquo;s secret of sufficiency in Christ: &ldquo;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.&rdquo; In this verse we find the secret to which Paul refers in verse 12: &ldquo;The secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack.&rdquo; Christ was his secret of sufficiency.</p>
<p>To be empowered by Christ is to be made dynamic inwardly. Christ dwells in us (Col. 1:27). He empowers us, makes us dynamic from within, not from without. By such inward empowering, Paul could do all things in Christ.</p>
<p>Paul was a person in Christ (2 Cor. 12:2), and he desired to be found in Christ by others. Now he declared that he could do all things in Him, in the Christ who empowered him. This is an all-inclusive and concluding word concerning his experience of Christ. It is the converse of the Lord&rsquo;s word concerning our organic relationship with Him in John 15:5: &ldquo;Apart from Me you can do nothing.&rdquo; As long as we have Christ and are in Him, we can do all things in Him.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;all things&rdquo; in Philippians 4:13 refer to the things mentioned in verse 12 and to the virtues listed in verse 8. This means that the application of verse 13 is limited by the context of verses 8 through 12. On the one hand, by the empowering of Christ, we can live a contented life (vv. 11-12). For us to be able to do all things in Christ who empowers us is to be satisfied in any circumstance through Christ who empowers us as the secret of our daily Christian life. On the other hand, by the empowering of Christ, we can be true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of. This means that we are persons in Christ, who empowers us to live out every kind of virtue. This is to live Christ, to magnify Christ in His virtues.</p>
<p>We need to realize that Paul&rsquo;s word about Christ as the empowering One specifically applies to Christ&rsquo;s empowering us to live Him as our human virtues and thereby to magnify Him in His unlimited greatness. The six virtues mentioned in verse 8 are actually the image of God. God created man in His image, that is, in His attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The fact that man was made in the image of God means that he was made in the form of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. The six items&mdash;what things are true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of&mdash;are in these four divine attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. These are the real virtues, for they are the expression of Christ. Christ empowers the believers to live Him and magnify Him in all these virtues. In Christ who empowers us, we can practice these things, expressing these highest human virtues; in Christ who empowers us, we can be true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of.</p>
<p>To live a life of all these virtues is much more difficult than doing a Christian work. Many can preach the gospel, teach the Bible, and even establish churches, but they are not able to live this kind of life, a life full of the virtues of being true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of. In order to live Christ as our human virtues for the expression of the divine attributes, we need to be empowered by the indwelling Christ.</p>
<p>If we would experience Christ as the empowering One enabling us to do all things in Him, we need to let Him live in us (Gal. 2:20), be formed in us (4:19), make His home in us (Eph. 3:17), and be magnified in us (Phil. 1:20). If we fail to do these things, He will not have the way to empower us, but when Christ lives in us, is formed in us, makes His home in us, and is magnified in us, the way is prepared for Him to empower us. Then, empowered by the indwelling Christ, we will be able to do all the things spoken of in Philippians 4:8 through 12.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. To Have God Fill Every Need of Ours in Him</h2>
<p>In verse 19 Paul says that his God will abundantly repay the believers. In his experience Paul had the conviction and assurance that God was his God. He could say, &ldquo;My God will fill your every need.&rdquo; God was Paul&rsquo;s God because Paul was one with Him. Thus, Paul regarded the material gift sent to him from the Philippian believers as a sacrifice to God (v. 18). Furthermore, he believed with assurance that God would richly repay them. Here we see that whenever we receive a gift, we need to have the assurance that this gift is presented not only to us but also to God. Then we need to have the conviction that God will repay the one who gives this gift. In His repayment, God will fill every need of the giver, fully supplying that one and satisfying him.</p>
<p>Paul told the Philippians that God would fill every need of theirs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. Because the Philippians cared for God&rsquo;s sent one, God would care for their every need. Philippians 4:19 indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s repayment is &ldquo;in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; <em>In Christ Jesus</em> modifies the word <em>fill</em>. Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the base, the element, the sphere, and the channel in and by which God cares for His people according to His riches and in glory. As the all-inclusive One, Christ is the element, realm, channel, and atmosphere of God&rsquo;s repayment. This indicates that even the believers&rsquo; giving and receiving of material things are intimately related to the experience of Christ as the One who empowers them.</p>
<p>In summary, we need to experience and enjoy Christ as the One who empowers us so that we will stand firm in Him, rejoice in Him always, let the peace of God guard our hearts, be content all the time, do all things that express the highest human virtues, and have God fill our every need in Christ. When we enjoy Christ to this extent, although there may be many problems in our circumstances, in Christ and with God they will be solved.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(58)</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Colossians.</p>
<h2 class="head3">80. The Portion of the Saints</h2>
<p>In Colossians 1:12 Paul says, &ldquo;Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the portion of the saints is the all-inclusive Christ for our enjoyment. When Paul was writing the Epistle to the Colossians and was speaking of the portion of the saints, he had in mind the type of the good land. When the children of Israel entered the good land and took possession of the land, God commanded them to divide the land into lots and to allot them to the children of Israel so that they would receive a portion of the good land for their inheritance and enjoyment. Paul in Colossians presented the all-inclusive Christ as the reality of the good land allotted to us by God. We, the believers in Christ, have received a portion of Christ as the good land, which Paul calls the portion of the saints.</p>
<p>God the Father has qualified us by the redemption of God the Son and through the sanctification of God the Spirit for a share of the all-inclusive Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, as the allotted portion of the saints. The will of God is that the all-inclusive, extensive Christ is to be our portion. In verse 9 Paul speaks of God&rsquo;s will. In this verse, God&rsquo;s will refers to Christ. God&rsquo;s will for us is that we know Christ, experience Christ, enjoy Christ, be saturated with Christ, and have Christ become our life and person. The will of God is profound in relation to our knowing, experiencing, and living the all-inclusive, extensive Christ.</p>
<p>The New Testament believers&rsquo; inheritance, their allotted portion, is not a physical land; it is the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit (2:6-7; Gal. 3:14). He is the allotted portion of the saints as their divine inheritance for their enjoyment. The riches of the good land typify the unsearchable riches of Christ in the different aspects of His bountiful supply to His believers in His Spirit (Deut. 8:7-10; Eph. 3:8; Phil. 1:19). By enjoying the riches of the land, the believers in Christ are built up to be His Body as the house of God and the kingdom of God (Eph. 1:22-23; 2:21-22; 1 Tim. 3:15; Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.The Son of God&rsquo;s Love,<br />
the One of Whom Is the Kingdom and<br />
in Whom We Have Redemption</h2>
<p>In Colossians 1:13-14 Paul tells us that the Father delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. As the portion of the saints, Christ is the Son of God&rsquo;s love, the kingdom of God is the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love, and in Christ we have redemption. We were redeemed to inherit the kingdom of God, which is the kingdom of God&rsquo;s beloved Son.</p>
<p>Just as the good land was the portion of the children of Israel, so Christ today is the portion of the saints. After revealing in verse 12 the all-inclusive Christ as the allotted portion of the saints, Paul in verse 13 tells us that the Father delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love. Verse 13 reminds us of the way the children of Israel were delivered out of Egypt and transferred into the good land. Thus, Paul&rsquo;s concept in verse 13 is the same as that revealed in the exodus from Egypt and in the entering into the good land. In ancient times, God delivered His people out of Egypt and brought them into the good land. God the Father has done the same thing with us. He has delivered us out of the authority of darkness, typified by Pharaoh and Egypt, and has transferred us into the all-inclusive Christ, typified by the good land. Just as the children of Israel were transferred out of Egypt into a land flowing with milk and honey, a land where there was no tyranny, so we also have been transferred into a marvelous realm, called the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love. Therefore, to be qualified for a share of the portion of the saints is actually to enter into the reality of the good land. Paul&rsquo;s composition of verses 12 and 13 is thus according to the picture in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Son of God&rsquo;s Love,<br />
the One of Whom Is the Kingdom</h2>
<p>Verse 13 is the explanation and definition of how the Father has qualified us for a share of the portion of the saints. This verse says that the Father &ldquo;delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.&rdquo; For Christ to be the Head of the Body, and for us, His believers, to be the members of His Body, God needed to deliver us out of the authority of darkness, the kingdom of Satan (Matt. 12:26), and to transfer us into the kingdom of Christ, the kingdom of God&rsquo;s Beloved. This is to qualify us to partake of the all-inclusive Christ as our allotted portion.</p>
<p>If we were still under the authority of darkness, we would not be qualified to share in Christ. But the Father has delivered us out of the authority of darkness, and we are no longer in the satanic kingdom. Our being delivered from the authority of darkness was the first step to be qualified to have a share in Christ. The second step was our being transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love. We have undergone both a deliverance and a transfer. Because Satan is darkness, and Christ, the Son of God, is light, Satan&rsquo;s kingdom is the authority of darkness, whereas the kingdom of the Son of God is the kingdom of light. By being delivered out of Satan&rsquo;s kingdom and transferred into Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, we have been qualified for a share of the portion of the saints.</p>
<p>Through regeneration we have been not only delivered out of the authority of darkness but also transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love (John 3:5). The kingdom of the Son is the authority of Christ (Rev. 11:15; 12:10). Moreover, the Son of the Father is the expression of the Father as the source of life (John 1:18, 4; 1 John 1:2). The Father as the source of life is expressed in the Son.</p>
<p>The Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is the object of the Father&rsquo;s love to be the embodiment of life to us in the divine love with the authority in resurrection. The Son, as the embodiment of the divine life, is the object of the Father&rsquo;s love. The divine life embodied in the Son is given to us in the divine love. Therefore, the object of the divine love becomes to us the embodiment of life in the divine love with the authority in resurrection. This is the kingdom of the Son of His love.</p>
<p>It is easier to give an illustration of the kingdom of the Son of His love than it is to give an adequate definition of it. Let us consider our experience. Realizing that the Lord Jesus is so loving and lovable, we begin to love Him. As we love the Lord Jesus, we are conscious of a sweet sense of love. Not only does this sense of love include the Lord Jesus, but it also includes us. We realize that we also are the objects of the divine love. As objects of this divine love, we spontaneously come under a certain control or ruling. Before we loved the Lord Jesus, we were free to do whatever we wanted. But the more we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You,&rdquo; the less freedom we have. Before we loved the Lord Jesus, we did not sense this ruling or restriction. We could mistreat people or engage in worldly entertainments without any sense of inward restriction. But as those who love the Lord Jesus, we have come under His rule. This rule is not harsh; on the contrary, it is sweet and pleasant. We are restricted and ruled in such a sweet way. Because of the pleasantness of the Lord&rsquo;s rule in us, we do not care even to speak a vain word or to have a thought that is displeasing to Him. We are ruled and restricted to the uttermost in the sweetness of love. This is the kingdom of the Son of His love.</p>
<p>The more we are willing to be restricted and ruled by the Lord Jesus out of our love for Him, the more we will grow in life, even in the abundance of life. This indicates that the kingdom of the Son of His love is for our enjoyment of Christ as life. Here we are freed from everything other than Christ, not only from evil things but also from things such as philosophy, ordinances, observances, and asceticism. When we were holding to our philosophy, ethics, asceticism, and ordinances, we were under the authority of darkness. But God has delivered us out of this authority and has transferred us into a kingdom of love that is full of life and light. Here we have no observances, rituals, ordinances, practices, philosophies, mysticism, Gnosticism, or asceticism. We just have Christ, the Son of His love. Here we have love, light, and life. This is to live by Christ.</p>
<p>To live by Christ means that we do not live by anything other than Christ. If we see what it is to live by Christ, we will realize that many of us are still under some form of control established by the self, a control set up and carried out by the self. This kind of control is the authority of darkness. If we are under this authority, we receive no light in reading the Bible, and we have no utterance in prayer. Although the Father has delivered us out of the authority of darkness, out of our natural thought, emotion, preference, and behavior, we may still remain in some aspect of our natural being. This causes us to be held under the authority of darkness. Because in actuality we are under the authority and control of darkness and are not in the kingdom of the Son of His love in a practical way, we have little enjoyment of Christ as the portion of the saints.</p>
<p>To insist on a particular ordinance or practice is to be under the authority of darkness. Our Father has delivered us out of the authority of darkness and has transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love. Here we are restricted by the divine love in the divine life. Instead of ordinances, observances, religion, or philosophy, we have Christ and Christ alone. If we see this, there will be no disputes or divisions in the church life.</p>
<p>To be transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is to be transferred into the Son who is life to us (1 John 5:12). The Son in resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 6:4-5) is now the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). He rules us in His resurrection life with love. This is the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love. When we live by the Son as our life in resurrection, we are living in His kingdom, enjoying Him in the Father&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>We have been transferred into a realm where we are ruled in love with life. Here, under the heavenly ruling and restriction, we have genuine freedom, the proper freedom in love, with life, and under light. This is what it means to be delivered out of the authority of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of His love. Here in this kingdom we enjoy Christ and have the church life. Here there is no opinion or division. Here we have one thing: the church life with Christ as everything to us. This is the revelation of the book of Colossians.</p>
<p>In Colossians the authority of darkness refers to the good aspects of culture and of our character, disposition, and natural being. The authority of darkness includes our virtues, religion, philosophy, observances, ordinances, principles, and ethical standards. God has delivered us out of all this and has transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, where we live under a heavenly rule and restriction. In this kingdom we are not under a harsh rule but under the loving rule of the Son. Here we do not sense that we are under righteousness, power, or authority but under the loving and lovable Lord Jesus. The more we tell the Lord Jesus that we love Him, the more we are freed on the one hand, and the more we are restricted and ruled on the other hand. Because we love Him, we desire to take Him as our person and as our life. This is the proper Christian life for the church life.</p>
<p>The kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love comprises three ages: the present age, in which the church is; the coming age, in which the millennial kingdom will be; and the eternal age with the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. These three aspects are considered by Paul in Colossians 1:13 as the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>The words <em>the Son of God</em> are a delight to the Father&rsquo;s ears. When the Lord Jesus was baptized, the Father declared, &ldquo;This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight&rdquo; (Matt. 3:17). When the Lord was transfigured, the Father made the same declaration (17:5). Because the Father delights in His Son, the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is a pleasant thing, a matter of delight.</p>
<p>The emphasis in Colossians 1:13 is the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love in this age, which is the reality of the church. The church life today is the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love, which is as delightful to God the Father as the Son of God is. We, the believers, all have been transferred into this delightful kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love. God the Father loves the delightful part of the kingdom, just as He loves His delightful Son as His own. Hence, the church, as the delightful part of the divine kingdom, is considered a great blessing to God&rsquo;s redeemed people by the apostle Paul in the book of Colossians, a book which is on Christ as the all-inclusive portion of God&rsquo;s people.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) The One in Whom We Have Redemption</h2>
<p>In verse 14 Paul continues, &ldquo;In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; The deliverance in verse 13 deals with Satan&rsquo;s authority over us by destroying his evil power, whereas the redemption in this verse deals with our sins by fulfilling God&rsquo;s righteous requirement. The forgiveness of sins is the redemption which we have in Christ. Christ&rsquo;s death has accomplished redemption unto the forgiveness of our sins.</p>
<p>In Christ, the Son of God&rsquo;s love, we have redemption and forgiveness. When we believed in Christ as our Redeemer, God immediately delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of light. Here in the light we are qualified for a share of the portion of the saints. This means that we are qualified to enjoy Christ. Because this qualification is an accomplished fact, there is no need for us to pray about it. On the contrary, like Paul we should simply thank the Father for this. However, there is the need for us to pray concerning knowing the will of God and walking worthily of the Lord to please Him in all things (vv. 9-10). Now that we are in the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love, enjoying Him in the light, we must go on to know Him in full and to walk worthily of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Image of the Invisible God</h2>
<p>As the portion of the saints, Christ is not only the Son of God&rsquo;s love but also the image, the expression, of the invisible God. Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the &ldquo;image of the invisible God.&rdquo; God is invisible, but the Son of His love, &ldquo;the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance&rdquo; (Heb. 1:3), is His image, expressing what He is. Christ as the Son of God&rsquo;s love who has God&rsquo;s life and nature can express God.</p>
<p>The image in Colossians 1:15 does not mean a physical form but an expression of God&rsquo;s being in all His attributes and virtues. This interpretation is confirmed by 3:10 and 2 Corinthians 3:18. The image of God is the form of God&rsquo;s attributes. God has many attributes, and God&rsquo;s inward being is the totality of His attributes. An attribute is an element that belongs to God. God is love, light, holiness, righteousness, power, might, and strength (1 John 4:8; 1:5; Lev. 19:2; Heb. 12:10; Psa. 7:9b; Jer. 23:6). These and many other items are the elements that belong to God; hence, they are His attributes. When these attributes are expressed, they become virtues. First Peter 2:9 says that we are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that we may tell out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. Here Peter uses the word <em>virtues</em> instead of <em>attributes.</em> Virtues are expressed attributes, and attributes are hidden or concealed virtues. When Christ lived on earth, He expressed God&rsquo;s attributes in His virtues. He expressed the divine attributes in His humanity as virtues. All the divine attributes have an image. This image is Christ the Son as the expression of the invisible God in the essence of His attributes (2 Cor. 4:4b).</p>
<p>How does Christ, the image of the invisible God, express God? As the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love, He expresses the Triune God because He is the One through whom both the old creation and the new creation came into being (Col. 1:16-18). Furthermore, He expresses the Triune God because He is the Firstborn of both creations (vv. 15, 18). This makes Him the full expression of God.</p>
<p>To say that Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the image of God implies that He is God, the Creator. When we see Christ, we see the expression of the invisible God, for He Himself is God. Christ is the image of the invisible God, God Himself expressed. The Christ who is our good land, the allotted portion of the saints, is also the image of the Triune God, His expression.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(59)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the portion of the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Firstborn of All Creation</h2>
<p>As the allotted portion of the saints, Christ is the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15). Since Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, He is the first of all creation. Christ as God is the Creator. However, as man, sharing the created blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14a), He is part of the creation. <em>Firstborn of all creation</em> refers to Christ&rsquo;s preeminence in all creation, because from Colossians 1:15-18 the apostle stresses the first place that Christ has in all things. Verse 15 reveals that Christ is not only the Creator but also the first among all created things, the first among all creatures.</p>
<p>Some insist that Christ is only the Creator, not a creature. But the Bible reveals that Christ is both the Creator and a creature, for He is both God and man. As God, Christ is the Creator, but as man, He is a creature. Because He was a creature, He took on a body with flesh, blood, and bones. Our Christ is God, has always been God, and always will be God. But through incarnation He became a man. Otherwise, He could not have been arrested, tried, and crucified, and He could not have shed His blood on the cross for our sins. We should praise the Lord for the truth that our Christ is both God and man.</p>
<p>As God, Christ is eternal and did not need to be born, but in verse 15 He is called the Firstborn of all creation. Anything that requires birth must be a creature, part of creation. If Christ were only God and not man, He could not have been born, for God is infinite and eternal, without beginning or ending. But as a man, Christ had to be born. Christ was born as a man. In keeping with this, Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / ...And His name will be called...Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; As a child born to us, Christ is called Mighty God; as a Son given to us, His name is called Eternal Father. As the Mighty God and the Eternal Father, Christ is eternal, but as a child and a Son, He had to be born. Some argue that Christ was born but not created. According to the Bible, birth is the carrying out of creation. Therefore, to be born is to be created.</p>
<p>Some may wonder how Christ could be the Firstborn of all creation since He was born less than two thousand years ago, not at the beginning of creation. If we would understand this properly, we need to realize that with God there is no time element. For example, according to our estimate of time, Christ was crucified about two thousand years ago, but Revelation 13:8 says that Christ was slain from the foundation of the world. Both are right. However, God&rsquo;s reckoning is much more important than ours. In the eyes of God, Christ was crucified from the foundation of the world. In eternity God foresaw the fall of man. Therefore, also in eternity He made preparation for the accomplishment of redemption.</p>
<p>The difference between God&rsquo;s estimate of time and ours also helps us to understand why Christ is called the second man (1 Cor. 15:47). From our point of view, the second man was Cain, the son of the first Adam, but from God&rsquo;s point of view, the second man is Christ.</p>
<p>We may apply this matter of the different ways of reckoning time to Christ as the Firstborn of all creation. According to our sense of time, Christ was born in Bethlehem approximately two thousand years ago, but in the eyes of God, the Lord Jesus was born before the foundation of the world. If He was slain from the foundation of the world, certainly He must have been born before then. Therefore, according to God&rsquo;s perspective in eternity, Christ was born in eternity past. This is the reason that, according to God&rsquo;s viewpoint, Christ has always been the first of all creatures. God foresaw the day that Christ would be born in a manger in Bethlehem. Because Christ is the first among the creatures, we can say that as the all-inclusive One He is both the Creator and part of creation.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Being Before All Things</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:17 says, &ldquo;He is before all things.&rdquo; This indicates His eternal preexistence.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) All Things Being Created in Him,<br />
through Him, and unto Him</h2>
<p>In verse 16 Paul says, &ldquo;Because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&rdquo; <em>In Him</em> means in the power of Christ&rsquo;s person. All things were created in the power of what Christ is. All creation bears the characteristics of Christ&rsquo;s intrinsic power. <em>Through Him</em> indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was accomplished in sequence. In keeping with this, John 1:3 says, &ldquo;All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.&rdquo; In this verse the emphasis is not that Christ is the Creator but that He is the means through which creation was processed and came into existence. <em>Unto Him</em> indicates that Christ is the end of all creation. All things were created unto Him for His possession. <em>In, through,</em> and <em>unto</em> indicate that creation is subjectively related to Christ. The creation was created in Him as the sphere, through Him as the means, and unto Him as the goal.</p><h2 class="head5">(3) All Things Subsisting Together in Him</h2>
<p>In verse 17 Paul says, &ldquo;All things cohere in Him.&rdquo; This means that all things now subsist together in Christ, just as all the spokes of a wheel subsist together in the hub. Christ is the hub of all things that exist in the universe; they all subsist together in Christ as the hub. Scientists recognize the fact that there is some kind of power in the universe that holds everything together. This scientific fact fits Paul&rsquo;s concept of all things subsisting in Christ. The holding power, which is the hub, the center, of the universe, is Christ. Because Christ is this holding power, all things subsist in Christ; He is the center that holds everything together, the hub that holds all the spokes. Everything in the universe, living and non-living, subsists in Christ as this hub. Without Christ, the universe and everything in it would collapse. We are upheld not by the earth but by Christ. Apparently we exist on the earth, but actually we are existing in Christ. Our existence is maintained by Christ in whom all things are held together.</p>
<p>Christ is the Firstborn of all creation in order to express God. We have pointed out in the previous message that Christ is the image of God (Col. 1:15). God is invisible, but if we look at God&rsquo;s creation, we will see that creation is the expression of the invisible God. In creation we see the expression of God&rsquo;s power and nature. In the words of Romans 1:20, &ldquo;The invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse.&rdquo; Christ is the image of God expressed in creation. If we see this, we will realize that all material things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ and that they all subsist in Christ for the purpose that God may be expressed.</p>
<p>We need to see that Christ is the Firstborn among all created things; the various aspects of God&rsquo;s creation are the expression of God in Christ. When we look at the heavens, we should be reminded of Christ. When we consider the earth, we should think of Christ. We should be mindful of Christ even when we look at ourselves. Every aspect of God&rsquo;s creation was created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ. All these things continue to subsist in Christ for the expression of God. This expression of God in creation is Christ as God&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>The universe is the expression of God by Christ. Throughout the universe we see Christ, the image of the invisible God. We see Christ everywhere and in everything. Therefore, we should live Christ, not anything else. The Christ whom we live is all-inclusive. He is the image, the expression, of God in the original creation. Thus, our concept of the universe should be altogether related to Christ. We should only know Christ and live according to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Head of the Body, the Church</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:18 says, &ldquo;He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things.&rdquo; This verse shows that Christ is the first in resurrection as the Head of the Body. As such, He has the first place in the church, God&rsquo;s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15).</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. The Beginning, the Firstborn from the Dead,<br />
That He Might Have the First Place in All Things</h2>
<p>According to Colossians 1:18, Christ is the beginning of the new creation, the Firstborn from the dead. As the Firstborn of all creation, He was the first item of the old creation. Now in resurrection Christ as the Firstborn from the dead is the first item of the new creation. Hence, He is the beginning of the new creation that He might have the first place, the preeminence, in all things.</p>
<p>As the Son of God, Christ passed through two births. The first birth took place at His incarnation, and the second, in His resurrection. All Christians realize that Christ was born through incarnation, but not many regard His resurrection also as a birth. Acts 13:33 indicates that Christ was begotten, or born, in resurrection. Through resurrection He was begotten as the Son of God.</p>
<p>Before His incarnation, Christ was not a man; He was simply the infinite, eternal God. But in the fullness of time, Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of Mary, and nine months later He was born in a manger in Bethlehem (Matt. 1:18, 20; 2:1; Luke 2:7). According to John 1:14, the Word who is Christ became flesh. This means that He took the step of becoming a man. How marvelous that through incarnation the infinite, eternal God became a man! However, in becoming man, He did not cease to be God.</p>
<p>After living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, Christ was crucified. Then in resurrection He took a second step to be born the second time and become the firstborn Son of God. Before His resurrection, Christ was the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16), but through resurrection the only begotten Son became the Firstborn among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). According to Hebrews 2:10, God is leading many sons into glory. These many sons are the many brothers of Christ as the firstborn Son.</p>
<p>Through the two births of Christ, divinity has been brought into humanity, and humanity has been brought into divinity. By the incarnation of Christ, God was brought into man. Prior to Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, God was outside of man. However, through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, God was brought into humanity. We may say that with the birth of Christ in incarnation God was born into man. Therefore, by Christ&rsquo;s first birth God was brought into man and became one with man. Then through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection man was brought into God. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, God was living in a man, for God was in Him. Now, through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, man has been brought into God. As a man, Christ is in the heavens. God has been brought into man, and man has been brought into God. In this two-way traffic God came into man through incarnation, and man was brought into God through resurrection. In eternity Christ was God. Through His incarnation He became a man, and through resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>Through Christ, God has been brought into us, and we have been brought into God. When we were born again, simultaneously Christ was born into us, and we were brought into God. Therefore, in our Christian life we have an inward and personal experience of both of the births of Christ. With Christ, His birth in resurrection came thirty-three and a half years after His birth through incarnation. However, in our experience of Christ, God was brought into us and we were brought into God at the same time. We should praise the Lord for the marvelous traffic between God and us.</p>
<p>God has accomplished two creations, the old creation and the new creation. The old creation includes heaven, earth, mankind, and millions of different items. The new creation is the church, the Body of Christ. Colossians 1:15-17 unveils Christ as the first in the original creation, as the One who has the preeminence among all creatures. Verse 18 shows that Christ is the first in resurrection as the Head of the Body. He is the One who has the first place in the church.</p>
<p>The first creation came into being through the speaking of God. In the words of Romans 4:17, God called the things not being as being. The new creation, on the contrary, came into being through resurrection, through the death and resurrection of the old creation. In this new creation, the church, Christ is the Firstborn from the dead.</p>
<p>Both in the old creation and in the new creation, Christ is the first. If the old creation is in Christ, through Christ, unto Christ and subsists together in Christ, so the new creation is all the more. As the new creation, we, the church, are in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ. Moreover, we are moment by moment subsisting together in Christ. Outwardly we are the old creation, but inwardly we are the new creation. In the church we are in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and we subsist in Christ to be God&rsquo;s expression in Christ.</p>
<p>In both the old creation and the new creation Christ is the first and occupies the first place, the place of preeminence. Both in the universe and in the church, Christ is the preeminent One. If we see this as a vision&mdash;not as a mere doctrine&mdash;our living and our church life will be revolutionized. We will realize that in all things Christ must be the first.</p>
<p>In Colossians 1:18 Paul says, &ldquo;That He Himself might have the first place in all things.&rdquo; In the Bible to be the first is to be all. Since Christ is the first both in the universe and in the church, He must be all things in the universe and in the church. As the first, He is all.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s way of reckoning in this matter is different from ours. According to our estimation, if Christ is the first, then something else should be the second, third, and others in sequence. However, from God&rsquo;s point of view, for Christ to be the first means that He is all. He is the Alpha, the Omega, and all the letters between (Rev. 22:13).</p>
<p>The first Adam included not only Adam as an individual but all of mankind. In the same principle, in the eyes of God, the firstborn of the Egyptians included all the Egyptians (Exo. 12:12). The firstborn includes all. Therefore, for Christ to be the Firstborn in the universe means that He is everything in the universe. In like manner, for Christ to be the Firstborn in resurrection means that He is everything in resurrection. For Christ to be the Firstborn both of the old creation and of the new creation means that He is everything both in the old creation and in the new creation. This corresponds to Paul&rsquo;s word in Colossians 3:11, where he says that in the new man, in the new creation, &ldquo;there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; In the new man Christ is everyone and is in everyone. In the new creation there is room only for Christ.</p>
<p>The revelation concerning Christ in Colossians is both all-inclusive and extensive. Colossians reveals that Christ is everything. Christ is the Firstborn both of the old creation, the universe, and of the new creation, the church (1:15, 18). The universe is the environment in which the church, the new creation, exists as the Body of Christ to express Christ in full. The new creation is not as extensive as the old creation, the universe. The church is all-inclusive, but it is not extensive. For Christ to be the Firstborn of both the original creation and the new creation means that He is both extensive and all-inclusive. In the new man there is room only for Christ; Christ is all and in all (3:11). This shows His all-inclusiveness. However, the fact that He is the Firstborn of all creation indicates His extensiveness. In the words of Ephesians 3:18, Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth.</p>
<p>It makes a tremendous difference when the vision of the all-inclusiveness of Christ pervades our being. When we see this vision, we will hate everything that issues from the self. We will despise not only our hatred but even our love, kindness, and patience. As this vision causes us to hate the self, it will constrain us to love the Lord. We will say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You because You are everything. Lord, there is no need for me to struggle or strive to do anything. O Lord, You are so much to me. You are God, You are the Firstborn of all creation, and You are the Firstborn from the dead.&rdquo; We need to pray until all the aspects of Christ revealed in Colossians saturate our being. We need to be infused and saturated with Christ as the all-inclusive One. If Christ is infused into us, we will drop everything that is not Christ, and we will be constituted with Christ in our being.</p><h2 class="head4">f. In Him All the Fullness of God<br />
Being Pleased to Dwell</h2>
<p>In Colossians 1:19, Paul tells us that in Christ &ldquo;all the fullness was pleased to dwell.&rdquo; Here the word <em>fullness</em> is personified. If the fullness were not a person, how could the fullness be pleased to dwell in Christ? The expression <em>was pleased to dwell</em> indicates that the fullness is the divine person. This divine person, the fullness, was pleased to dwell in Christ. This fullness&mdash;God Himself expressed&mdash;was pleased to dwell in Christ, to reconcile us with Himself, and to present us to Himself.</p>
<p>The fullness in verse 19 refers to the image of God in verse 15, who is Christ, a living person. The image of the invisible God is the full expression of the unseen God. For the fullness to dwell in Christ means that all the expression of God, all of His image, was pleased to dwell in Him.</p>
<p>From verses 15 through 19 Christ is revealed as the first both in the old creation and in the new creation. As the One who is first in both of God&rsquo;s creations, Christ is the expression of God. God is expressed in Him because all things have come into being in Him, through Him, and unto Him, and they subsist in Him. This is true not only of the old creation but even the more of the new creation. The new creation, the church, is Christ&rsquo;s Body, of which He is the Head. Through His subjective relationship to creation, Christ is the fullness of the unseen God, the image of the invisible God. The fullness in verse 19 is not a thing; it is a person who is the expression, the image, of the Triune God.</p>
<p><em>All the fullness</em> refers to the fullness in both the old creation and the new creation. The word <em>fullness</em> has no modifier, indicating that this fullness is the unique fullness. It denotes not the riches of what God is but the expression of those riches. The full expression of the rich being of God, in both creation and the church, dwells in Christ. All creation and the whole church are filled with Christ as the expression of God&rsquo;s riches. Such a fullness is pleased with this. This is pleasant to Christ.</p>
<p>The rich being of God is expressed both in the old creation and in the new creation through Christ as the One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things came into being and as the One in whom all things subsist. It is in such a way that the invisible God is expressed. When we consider the universe and the church, the old creation and the new creation, we see all the fullness of the Triune God. We behold the expression of the Triune God. This fullness was pleased to dwell in the Son and to reconcile all things to Himself for His expression. Furthermore, this fullness will present us holy, blameless, and without reproach to Himself so that He may have His expression in the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. Through Him God Having Reconciled<br />
All Things to Himself, Having Made Peace<br />
through the Blood of His Cross</h2>
<p>In verse 20 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross&mdash;through Him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens.&rdquo; The expression <em>through Him</em> means through Christ as the active instrument through which the reconciliation was accomplished. Verse 20 speaks not of &ldquo;all people&rdquo; but of &ldquo;all things,&rdquo; referring not only to human beings but also to all creatures, which were created in Christ and now subsist, cohere, in Him (vv. 16-17) and are reconciled to God through Him. To reconcile all things to Himself is to make peace with Himself for all things. This was accomplished through the blood of the cross of Christ. This indicates that Christ is the Redeemer not only of mankind but of all things. Consider the picture of the ark built by Noah. The ark saved not only the eight members of Noah&rsquo;s family but also saved animals of every kind (Gen. 7:1-9; 8:1). What an extensive Redeemer Christ is, and what an extensive reconciliation He has accomplished!</p>
<p>Both the things in the heavens and things on the earth needed to be reconciled to God because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall. God created the universe and committed the universe to His archangel. Yet he with other angels rebelled against God and became God&rsquo;s enemy, thus polluting the entire universe and particularly contaminating the heavens. God then restored the polluted universe, created man, and gave man dominion over the universe, making man the head of the creation. However, man followed Satan and fell, thus polluting the earth. For this reason, both the things in the heavens and the things on the earth need to be reconciled to God. The blood of the cross of Christ was for not only man but also all the creatures in the heavens and the earth. Through the blood of Christ&rsquo;s cross, that is, through His death on the cross, God has reconciled to Himself all things both on the earth and in the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. Through Him God Having Reconciled the Saints<br />
to Present Them Holy and without Blemish<br />
and without Reproach before Him</h2>
<p>According to Colossians 1:21-22, among all His creation, Christ also reconciled us, the saints, to God in order to present us holy, without blemish, and without reproach before God. This reconciliation of the saints mentioned in verse 22 is from the reconciliation of all things mentioned in verse 20.</p>
<p>We need to enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the portion of the saints. As the image of the invisible God, He is the center of God; as the Firstborn of all creation, He is the center of the old creation; and as the Head of the Body, He is the center of the church. In resurrection He is the Firstborn from the dead. In Him all the fullness of God as the divine person was pleased to dwell. Through Him all things in the universe were reconciled to God, and through Him we, the saints, have been reconciled to God so that He may have a group of people who are holy, without blemish, and without reproach before Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(60)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">81. The Mystery of God</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:2-23 reveals that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the mystery of God. In verse 2 Paul speaks of the &ldquo;full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; This means that, as God&rsquo;s story and God&rsquo;s everything, Christ declares God in full. As the mystery of God, Christ is the Word of God (John 1:1; Rev. 19:13); Christ is the definition, explanation, and expression of God. Moreover, as the mystery of God, the mysterious story of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the history of God; the whole story of God is in Christ and is Christ (John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rev. 4:5). God is a mystery. Although God is infinite and eternal, without beginning or ending, He also has a history, a story. God&rsquo;s history refers to the process through which He passed so that He may come into man and that man may be brought into Him.</p>
<p>According to His good pleasure, God created the heavens and the earth and all the billions of items in the universe. Therefore, God accomplished the work of creation. Genesis 1:1 tells us that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, but Matthew 28:19 speaks of baptizing believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We know that the Father, Son, and Spirit are the God spoken of in Genesis 1:1. However, the difference is that at the time of Genesis 1:1, God had not yet been processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The word in Matthew 28:19 was spoken by the Lord after He had entered into resurrection, having passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion. After His resurrection, He charged His disciples to disciple the nations and to baptize them, not into the name of the Creator, whom we may call the unprocessed God but to baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This is to baptize the believers into the processed God. The processed God is God available to His chosen people, and His people can thus be baptized into Him. Although it is not possible to baptize believers into God as He is revealed in Genesis 1:1, we can baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; that is, we can baptize them into the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>Today the processed Triune God is the Spirit. At the time of John 7:39, the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. He had not yet passed through death and entered into resurrection. Now that Christ has passed through death and has entered into resurrection, the Spirit is here. This Spirit is Christ, and Christ is the story of God, the mystery of God. As the story of God, Christ is the processed God, God processed to become the all-inclusive Spirit, who now dwells in our spirit and is one with our spirit.</p>
<p>The Christ whom we have received is the mystery of God and the history of God. The Christ whom we have received is God with His wonderful history&mdash;God who passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, glorification, and enthronement. As the history of God, Christ is the mystery of God. Because the Jews do not have Christ, the God in whom they believe does not have such a history. Apart from Christ, there is neither the history of God nor the mystery of God.</p>
<p>As the mystery of God, Christ also is both the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9) and the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). In order to know Christ in reality as the embodiment of God, we need to experience Him as the life-giving Spirit. The reality of Christ as the embodiment of God is in Christ as the life-giving Spirit. As the mystery of God, Christ is not only the embodiment of the fullness of God but also the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit to be one spirit with us. We should tell the Lord, &ldquo;I care only for You as the embodiment of God and as the life-giving Spirit in my spirit. Because You are so real, living, and practical in my spirit, I can live by You and with You. Lord, my only desire is to experience You in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to focus our attention upon Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4-6). As the mystery of God, the all-inclusive Christ is the embodiment of God and the life-giving Spirit. As the mystery of Christ, the church is the Body of Christ, His fullness, and the new man to be the full expression of Christ (1:23; Col. 3:10-11). As Christ is the history of God, so the church is the history of Christ. As the history of Christ, the church is the mystery of Christ. In the church we are a continuation of this history.</p><h2 class="head4">a. In Whom All the Treasures<br />
of Wisdom and Knowledge Being Hidden</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:3 Paul says that in Christ all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden. In writing Colossians Paul was fighting against the Gnostic philosophy by declaring that Christ, as the totality of all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, is far better, higher, and more profound than the Gnostic philosophy. According to history, the influence of Gnostic teaching, which is a mixture of Jewish religion and Greek philosophy, invaded the Gentile churches in Paul&rsquo;s time. Those who were influenced by such teaching considered themselves as having much wisdom and knowledge, but they spoke many things concerning God and Christ that were not according to the truth. Hence, Paul told the Colossian believers that all the treasures of genuine wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ. This is the spiritual wisdom and knowledge of the divine economy concerning Christ and the church. Wisdom is related to our spirit, and knowledge is related to our mind (Eph. 1:8, 17).</p>
<p>Moreover, wisdom and knowledge refer to all the &ldquo;stories&rdquo; of God. All the stories of God are wisdom and knowledge. All the wisdom and knowledge pertaining to God&rsquo;s stories are hidden in this Christ who is the mystery of God. Therefore, Colossians 2:6-7 indicates that we who have received Christ Jesus the Lord should walk in Him and be rooted and built up in Him and should not listen to the empty words of philosophy and philosophical doctrines of the Gnostics.</p>
<p>God is the unique source of wisdom and knowledge. All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in the Christ who is the mystery of God. Because the church in Colossae had been invaded by pagan philosophy, Paul was helping the Colossians to trace wisdom and knowledge to their true source in God. Christ is the mystery of God, who alone is the source of all wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>The fact that wisdom and knowledge are embodied in Christ is proved by His spoken words, especially those recorded in the Gospels of Matthew and John. In these books, the Lord spoke about the kingdom and about life. The Lord&rsquo;s words recorded in these books contain the highest philosophy. None of the teachings of the philosophers, including the ethical teachings of Confucius, compare to them. The concept in the Lord&rsquo;s words is deep and profound. Anyone who makes a thorough study of philosophy will have to admit that the highest philosophy is that found in the teachings of Jesus Christ. Truly all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in Him. Since wisdom and knowledge are stored up in Christ as a treasure, we cannot have wisdom and knowledge unless we have Christ.</p>
<p>If we exercise our being to contact the Lord, Christ as the life-giving Spirit will saturate our spirit and our mind. Then we also will have in our experience the wisdom and knowledge that are hidden in Christ. In this way we will experience Him as the mystery of God. We should not be like the Colossians, who allowed pagan philosophy to defraud them of the wisdom and knowledge hidden in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Saints, Having Believed in Him and<br />
Having Received Him, Walking in Him,<br />
Having Been Rooted and Being Built Up in Him</h2>
<p>In 2:6-7 Paul says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him.&rdquo; We, the saints, having believed in Christ and having received Him, now walk in Him. Here to &ldquo;walk in Him&rdquo; means to live, to behave, to speak, and to have our being in the wonderful, all-inclusive Christ. We walk, having been rooted in Him as a plant in soil and being built up in Him as a building on a foundation (1 Cor. 3:9, 11). Christ is not only the soil in which we have been rooted but also the foundation on which we are being built up. We are both planted and built up in Christ; this indicates that we are altogether in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Having Received Him</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:6 Paul says that we &ldquo;have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord.&rdquo; Christ is the portion of the saints (1:12) for our enjoyment. To believe in Him is to receive Him. As the all-inclusive Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), He enters into us and dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22) to be everything to us.</p>
<p>Once we have received Christ Jesus, we need not receive Him again. But we should apply what we have received. We need to daily practice to apply the living Christ in a practical way. To employ a common term, we need to &ldquo;use&rdquo; Christ. This is difficult because by birth it is not natural for us to use Christ, nor does our training condition us to use Him. The hardest lesson for us to learn as Christians is to apply Christ and to use Him. In our daily living we spontaneously use the self instead of Christ. There is no need for us to try to use the self; we use it automatically and spontaneously. In the matter of applying Christ, we certainly need to watch and pray; that is, we need to be on the alert.</p>
<p>Although we have all received the Lord Jesus, we are short in using Him. If we fail to apply Him, then practically in our daily living there is little significance to having received Him. Our experience of Christ should not be superficial, and we should not take so many things for granted. We are thankful for God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ, and we are grateful that we have received Him. But now we must go on to apply the One whom we have received.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Walking in Him</h2>
<p>Having received Christ, we should walk in Him. To walk is to live, to act, to behave, and to have our being; it implies everything in our daily living. To walk in Christ is to live, move, act, and have our being in Christ. We should not live, walk, move, act, or have our being in anything other than Christ. Furthermore, to walk in Christ means not to have any substitute for Christ. Because of man&rsquo;s fall, culture replaces God in man&rsquo;s life. Man was made for God and needs God to be his life, his enjoyment, and everything to him. But because man lost God, he invented culture as a substitute for God. Now in His economy God has ordained that Christ, His Son, should accomplish redemption, bring man back to God, and then replace all the substitutes with Himself. The various factors and elements of our human life are all replacements for Christ, but the factors and elements that have become substitutes for God must now be replaced by Christ. In order for this to be our experience, we need to walk in Christ. Christ is not only the sphere, the realm, in which we walk, but He is also every factor and element of our human life. To experience Christ in this way is to walk in Him.</p>
<p>We should walk, live, and act in Christ so that we may enjoy His riches, just as the children of Israel lived in the good land and enjoyed all its rich produce. The good land today is Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit (Gal. 3:14), who dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16) to be our enjoyment. To walk according to this Spirit (v. 4; Gal. 5:16) is the central and crucial point in the New Testament.</p>
<p>In Galatians 3:14 Paul says, &ldquo;That the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&rdquo; Here Paul refers to the blessing of Abraham and the promise of the Spirit. This blessing refers to the good land, and the fulfillment of this blessing for us today is Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit. Therefore, according to Paul&rsquo;s concept, to walk in Christ as the good land is to walk in the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>In Colossians 2:6 Paul tells us to walk in Christ, but in Galatians 5:16 he charges us to walk by the Spirit. Furthermore, in Romans 8:4 he speaks of walking according to the spirit. These verses indicate that the good land for us today is the all-inclusive Spirit who indwells our spirit. This all-inclusive Spirit is the all-inclusive Christ as the processed Triune God. After being processed, the Triune God is the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit for us to experience. Today this all-inclusive Spirit indwells our spirit to be our good land.</p>
<p>Christ is the embodiment of God and the expression of God. Through incarnation, He became the last Adam, who was crucified for our redemption. In resurrection this last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Therefore, in 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Because Christ as the life-giving Spirit dwells in our spirit, we are one spirit with Him. In 2 Timothy 4:22 Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit,&rdquo; and in 1 Corinthians 6:17, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Therefore, Christ as the all-inclusive good land is now in our spirit.</p>
<p>Since the all-inclusive Spirit is mingled with our spirit, we should set our mind on this mingled spirit (Rom. 8:6). By doing this, we are spontaneously setting our mind on Christ. Then we must go on to walk in this mingled spirit. This means that we must live, move, behave, and have our being according to the spirit. In this way we will experience Christ and enjoy Him as the good land. Nothing in the New Testament is more central, crucial, and vital than walking according to the mingled spirit. Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit dwells in our spirit to be our life, our person, and our everything. Our need today is to return to Him, to set our mind on the spirit, and to walk according to the spirit. This is to walk in Christ as the mystery of God.</p>
<p>In our experience Christ should be the good land in which we live and walk. This should not merely be a doctrine to us. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I want to live and walk in You. Lord, I ask that You be the good land to me in my experience and that every aspect of my living may be in You.&rdquo; To walk in Christ is a way to experience Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:6).</p>
<p>After charging us to walk in Christ, Paul in verse 7 immediately adds the words, &ldquo;having been rooted and being built up in Him.&rdquo; If we would walk in Christ, we must fulfill the conditions of having been rooted in Him and being built up in Him. Our basis for walking in Christ is that we have already been rooted in Christ and that we are in the process of being built up in Him.</p><h2 class="head5">(3) Having Been Rooted in Him</h2>
<p>In 2:7 Paul speaks of having been rooted in Christ. Like plants, we are living organisms. As such, we have been rooted in Christ, our soil, our earth, that we may absorb all His riches as nourishment. These riches become the element and substance with which we grow and are built up. To be rooted is for the growth in life. This rooting has been completed already. To be built up is for the building of the Body of Christ. This is still going on. Both these matters are in Christ.</p>
<p>Paul realized the importance of being rooted in Christ. He knew that it was a serious matter to be transplanted from Christ and to be rooted in something else, such as heathen philosophy or Jewish ordinances. He wanted the Colossians to see that philosophy was not the soil in which they had been rooted. They had been rooted in Christ. He is our unique soil. Regrettably, many Christians have not been rooted in Christ adequately. Yet if we have been rooted in Him adequately, nothing will be able to distract us from Him.</p>
<p>In order to be rooted in Christ, we must first be planted into Him. In a number of places, the Bible speaks of planting. In the song of Moses we read these words: &ldquo;You will bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, / The place, O Jehovah, which You have made for Your dwelling&rdquo; (Exo. 15:17). Psalm 92:13 says, &ldquo;Planted in the house of Jehovah, / They will flourish in the courts of our God.&rdquo; In Jeremiah 2:21 the Lord says of His people, &ldquo;I had planted you as a choice vine, / Wholly a faithful seed,&rdquo; and in 32:41, &ldquo;I will plant them in this land in faithfulness with all My heart and with all My soul.&rdquo; In Matthew 15:13 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.&rdquo; According to John 15, the Lord Jesus regarded Himself as a vine and the Father as the husbandman, the One who planted the vine and cares for it. In 1 Corinthians 3:9 Paul says that we, the believers, are God&rsquo;s cultivated land. In Colossians 2:7 we see that we have been rooted in Christ. Christ is the land, the soil, and God has planted us into Him.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:6 Paul says that he planted, Apollos watered, and God causes the growth. This also indicates that the believers are plants and that Christ is the soil. Now we need to ask in what part of our being this planting has taken place. Certainly it is neither in the mind nor in the physical body; rather, it is in our spirit. The experience of being planted into Christ and rooted in Him takes place in our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). When a plant is rooted in the soil, it becomes one with the soil. First, the plant gets into the soil; then the nourishment in the soil comes into the plant. In this way, the plant and the soil become one in life. The nourishing element in the soil corresponds to the life in the plant, and something within the plant corresponds to the element in the soil. We may say that there is a fellowship between the plant and the soil. In this fellowship those factors in the plant and in the soil which correspond to each other become one in life. Thus, the plant and the soil become one unit in life.</p>
<p>In our spirit we have the experience of being planted into Christ, for here we are joined to Him and become one spirit with Him. The Lord, who is the soil in which we are rooted, is the Spirit. If He were not the Spirit, there would be no way for us to be planted into Him. Furthermore, if we had only a body and a soul but no spirit, it would not be possible for us to be planted into the Lord as the life-giving Spirit. However, because the Lord is the Spirit and because we have a spirit, there is a correspondence between us and Him. When we were regenerated, Christ as the life-giving Spirit became one with our spirit. As John 3:6 clearly indicates, regeneration takes place in the spirit. When we were regenerated, we were rooted in Christ as the soil. This is the reason Paul uses the perfect tense in Colossians 2:7. We were planted and rooted in Christ when we were regenerated in our spirit.</p>
<p>Only when we remain in the spirit are we actually rooted in Christ and thus able to walk in Him. We have been planted into Christ. But when we turn to our spirit, we have the experience of being rooted in Him. Having been rooted in Christ, we are able to walk in Him. In this way we experience Christ as the good land with the rich soil that affords us the nourishing life element. The more we are rooted in this soil, the more we absorb the nourishment of Christ into our being. This is not the objective Christ in doctrine; it is the subjective Christ in our experience.</p>
<p>We need to continually exercise our spirit. This is the reason that toward the end of the book of Colossians, Paul charges us to persevere in prayer (4:2). However, if, instead of exercising our spirit, we exercise our mind, emotion, and will, Satan will keep us from enjoying the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit. Satan, the subtle, evil one, uses the environment to keep us out of the spirit. Thus, we need to exercise our spirit continually by calling on the name of the Lord in order to become more deeply rooted in the all-inclusive Spirit. Then we will absorb the riches of Christ, grow in Christ, and spontaneously be built up in Christ. As a result, we will walk in Him. This is the practical experience of Christ that we all need.</p>
<p>Having been rooted in Christ, the rich, fertile soil, we should go on to absorb His riches. As a tree absorbs nourishing elements from the soil through its roots, we also should absorb the riches of Christ into us. A tree&rsquo;s growth depends upon the nourishment it absorbs from the soil through its roots. Since we have been rooted in Christ, we should remain in Him in a practical way. In our experience we need to stay rooted in Christ.</p>
<p>We need to take time to enjoy the Lord as the all-inclusive land so that all the elements of Christ as the rich soil may be absorbed into us in order for us to be made full in Him in our experience (2:10a; 4:2). If we contact the Lord and spend time in the Word with much prayer, we will become deeply rooted in Christ. The only way to become deeply rooted in Christ as the soil is to contact Him and daily absorb the water in the Word. The more we contact the soil and absorb the water, the more we will grow. First we grow downward, then upward. After we have grown downward for a period of time, we will automatically cease to walk in things other than Christ. Instead, because we have been deeply rooted in Christ, we will live, walk, act, and have our being in Christ.</p>
<p>In the morning many saints spend time with the Lord. However, even though they spend a certain amount of time with Him, they may not absorb much of His riches. The reason for this is that they are too rushed. If we are to absorb the riches of Christ into us as our nourishment, we should not be rushed. Every morning we need to take an adequate amount of time to absorb the Lord. We should not be lazy or indolent in this matter. When we take time to enjoy the Lord, the elements of the rich soil are absorbed into us.</p>
<p>We should spend time with the Lord not only in the morning but also throughout the day. We should absorb the Lord all day long; we should be like trees continually absorbing the riches of the soil. This means that we must learn to practice the continual enjoyment of Christ. We should let every physical thing be a reminder of Christ, for all these things are shadows of which Christ is the body (2:16-17). The clothing we put on each day should remind us of Christ. We should put Him on in our spirit and by our spirit. Drinking a glass of water should remind us to drink Christ by the exercise of our spirit. To follow this practice is to be rooted in Christ and to absorb His riches.</p>
<p>In order to absorb the riches of Christ as the soil, we need to have tender, new roots. We should not let ourselves become old but be fresh and renewed day by day. We need to pray to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I want my consecration to be fresh, and I want to open to You anew. I want my roots to be tender so that I may absorb Your riches. Lord, don&rsquo;t let my roots get old.&rdquo; If our roots are tender and new to absorb the riches of Christ, we will grow automatically with the riches that we assimilate. This is to enjoy Christ and to subjectively experience Him daily and hourly. We need to forget our situation, our condition, failures, and weaknesses and simply take time to absorb the Lord. As we take time to absorb Him, we grow with the growth of God in us for the building up of the Body of Christ (Matt. 14:22-23; 6:6; Col. 2:7a, 19b; cf. Luke 8:13).</p><h2 class="head5"> (4) Having Been Built Up in Him</h2>
<p>Having been rooted in Christ, we now are &ldquo;being built up in Him&rdquo; (Col. 2:7). Paul&rsquo;s words <em>being built up</em> in verse 7 do not directly refer to the building up of the Body of Christ. Rather, this expression denotes an increase in our spiritual stature, which can be compared to a person&rsquo;s increase in stature as he grows physically. The only way that a child can grow physically is by assimilating nourishing food. In the same way, we grow spiritually by assimilating the rich nourishment of Christ. This is what it means to be built up in Christ, as mentioned in verse 7. Paul first tells us that we have been rooted in Christ; then he goes on to say that we are being built up in Christ. No tree can grow up without first being rooted. The growing up of the tree is the building up of the tree. By absorbing the riches from Christ as the soil into our being, we are being built up with these riches. What we absorb into us becomes the material with which we are built up. He is the material, substance, and element with which we can have a greater spiritual measure so that we may be built up personally and with others as the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We are plants, and Christ is the soil to us; we also are the building, and Christ is the material with which we are built. In much the same way that an American child is built up by eating the produce of America, our spiritual measure is built up by our feeding on Christ. At present we may have a small spiritual measure. We need to grow to a greater measure of Christ, and the way to grow is by feeding on Christ, taking Him in, and digesting Him. Then He will be added to us more and more. We will have Christ increased within us, and our measure will grow. Christ is the material for the building up of our spiritual measure.</p>
<p>If we are lacking in spiritual stature, we cannot be built up as the Body of Christ. In Ephesians 4:13 Paul says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; The Body of Christ has a stature, and this stature has a full measure. We all need to grow until we arrive at the full measure of the stature of the Body of Christ. For us to be built up does not first mean that we are built up as the church, the Body; rather, it means that we are built up in the Lord and experience an increase in stature. Hence, in Colossians 2:7 to be built up actually means to grow in life. First, we are rooted in Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, and then we grow up into Him. We build ourselves up by growing up. Our being built up depends on our assimilating the riches of Christ as the soil into our being. Having assimilated these riches into us, we will grow and be built up. When we are fully grown, we will be built up. Therefore, to be built up simply means to grow. In order to grow, we need nourishment. Our growth depends on how much nourishment we assimilate into us by being rooted in Christ. Because we are rooted in Him, we absorb into us the riches of the all-inclusive Spirit. Then we grow with the nourishment that we derive from these riches.</p>
<p>The building up of the Body depends upon the individual and personal building up of all the members. If a particular member has not been built up, it will not be possible for him to be built up in the Body. To be built up in the Body we first must be built up in ourselves. When we have become built-up members, we will then be able to be built up with others in the Body.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, Paul in Ephesians 4:15 and 16 says, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; The concept here is similar to that in Colossians 2:19. We must hold to the truth in love so that we may grow up into the Head in all things. Out from the Head in whom we have grown we have nourishment, as indicated by the word <em>supply.</em> Through the supply which comes out from the Head, the Body grows and builds itself up in love. Much is implied here. The focal point of the implications of Ephesians 4:15 and 16 is that we should be rooted in Christ and absorb His nourishment into our being to become the element and substance with which we grow and are built up.</p>
<p>First, we grow individually, then corporately. Individual growth becomes corporate growth. Hence, not only are the members built up individually, but the Body is built up corporately. Our physical bodies illustrate this. Your body is built up through the growth of the individual members. If the members do not grow, the body cannot grow. Without growth, the members of the body cannot build themselves up. This would make it impossible for the body as a whole to be built up. Therefore, the building of the body depends on the building up of the individual members of the body. If all the members grow and build themselves up individually, the body will be built up corporately. The building up of the church is based upon the building up of the individual members. Furthermore, the building of the members depends on their growth, which, in turn, depends upon being rooted in Christ and absorbing the riches of Christ to become the element with which the members grow.</p>
<p>We should not be distracted from Christ and the church. The Colossians had been rooted in Christ, but they still had to go on to be built up in the church. In order to be built up corporately, the Colossians had to forsake the Judaistic observances and the heathen ordinances and philosophies. Otherwise, they would have been transplanted from Christ and rooted in something else. Furthermore, they would have been led astray from the church life. Whenever we take in some kind of philosophy, ordinance, observance, or practice in place of Christ, the church life is annulled. We are divided from those believers who have different opinions concerning these matters. Those who are preoccupied with such things will eventually cease to care about the church life, and it will no longer be possible for them to be built up in a corporate way. How crucial it is to be rooted in Christ and to be built up in Christ and in the church! In this way we experience Christ as the mystery of God.</p>
<p>In summary, we have received Christ as the mystery of God. Now we need to walk in Christ, that is, live, move, act, and have our being in Christ. If we would walk in Christ, we need to absorb His riches by being rooted in Him and built up as individual members of the Body. We need to sink our roots deeper and deeper so that we may absorb more of His riches. Then we will grow and be built up in Him. When we are adequately rooted in Christ and are personally built up in Christ, we will become the expression of Christ. This expression of Christ, Christ lived out of us, will eventually become corporate. This is the church as the Body and the new man. When the church becomes in reality such a new man, that will be the time for Christ to come back.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the mystery of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. In Him Dwelling All the Fullness<br />
of the Godhead Bodily</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:9 Paul says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; The word <em>dwells</em> indicates that the fullness of the Godhead must be a person; the fullness of the Godhead is personified. The fullness of the Godhead dwells as a person in the incarnated Christ bodily, that is, in Christ with a human body. Hence, the word <em>bodily</em> in verse 9 points to the physical body that Christ put on in His humanity, indicating that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ as One who has a human body.</p>
<p>Before Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but not bodily. From the time that Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in Him in a bodily way, and in His glorified body (Phil. 3:21) now and forever it dwells. The fact that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that it dwells in Him in a way that is both real and practical. Now that the fullness of the Godhead dwells as a divine person in Christ bodily, it is visible, touchable, and receivable.</p>
<p>The Colossians were under the influence of Gnosticism, which regards man&rsquo;s physical body and the entire material world as evil. The Gnostics considered themselves to have the highest wisdom and knowledge, but they failed to realize that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. In refuting the Gnostic philosophy, the apostle Paul told the Colossians that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</p>
<p>According to Colossians 2:9, Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead. <em>Fullness</em> here refers not to the riches of God but to the expression of the riches of God. What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead but the expression of the riches of what God is. The Godhead is expressed both in the old creation, the universe, and in the new creation, the church. We should note that in both 1:19 and 2:9 Paul uses the word <em>all</em> to describe fullness. All the fullness, all the expression, is in the old creation and in the new creation.</p>
<p>The Godhead in verse 9 refers to deity, which is different from the divine characteristics manifested by the created things (Rom. 1:20). This strongly indicates the deity of Christ. The fullness of the Godhead is versus the tradition of men and the elements of the world. The world&rsquo;s tradition and elements simply cannot be compared with the fullness of the Godhead.</p>
<p>All the fullness of the Godhead in verse 9 refers not only to the entire Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;but also to all that the entire Triune God is, has, does, knows, can do, has done, has obtained, has accomplished, and has attained; all this fullness dwells in the Son bodily. The Divine Trinity is the fullness of the Godhead, and this fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ. Therefore, Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all embodied in Christ. The fullness of the Godhead is threefold: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is rich, the Son is unlimited, and the Spirit is without measure. Because the Triune God is altogether embodied in Christ, outside of Christ there is no God, and outside of Christ we cannot find God or contact God. Christ is God&rsquo;s dwelling place, God&rsquo;s address, and God&rsquo;s home. If we want God yet do not want Christ, we cannot have God. When we receive, experience, and enjoy Christ, we receive, experience, and enjoy the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. In Him the Saints Being Made Full,<br />
Who Is the Head of All Rule and Authority</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:10 Paul continues, &ldquo;You have been made full in Him, who is the Head of all rule and authority.&rdquo; The Greek word translated <em>have been made full</em> is a verbal adjective based on the same root as the word translated <em>fullness,</em> a noun, in verse 9. We should understand the expression <em>have been made full</em> based upon the word <em>fullness</em> in verse 9. Because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily, we have been made full in Him.</p>
<p>According to verse 10, the Christ in whom we have been made full is the Head of all rule and authority. On the one hand, Christ possesses all the fullness of the Godhead, for it dwells in Him bodily; on the other hand, this Christ, who is the Head of all rule and authority, is above all rule and authority, that is, above all the fallen angels occupying positions of power in the air in subordination to Satan (v. 15). Christ not only has the fullness of the Godhead but is also above all rule, authority, and power of Satan. We have been put into such a Christ and have been made full in Him.</p><h2 class="head5">(1) Having Been Made Full in Him</h2>
<p>The Greek word translated <em>full</em> in verse 10 implies completion, perfection. Because all the fullness dwells in Him, after we have been put into Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), we are made full, filled up, with all the divine riches. Hence, we need no other source. In Christ we lack nothing, for in Him we have been perfected and completed. There is no reason for us to turn to anything other than Christ.</p>
<p>Because all the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ and because we have been placed in Him, we have been made full in Him. The New Testament reveals clearly that all those who believe in Christ have been put into Christ. Therefore, we are identified with Him and one with Him. The result is that all that He is and all that He has belongs to us, and all that He has experienced is our history. We inherit all that Christ has experienced and passed through. Furthermore, because we are one with Him, we partake of all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained.</p>
<p>We the believers are members of the all-inclusive Christ. We have been put into Him, identified with Him, and joined to Him as our Husband (Col. 1:28; Rom. 7:2-4). Hence, we are one with Him. All that He has passed through is now our history, and all that He has obtained and attained is our inheritance. We are in such a Christ, and He is in us. We have been placed into Him, we are one with Him, and we receive all that He is and has.</p>
<p>Although some Christians have a doctrinal knowledge of this, a mere mental understanding of our union with Christ is not adequate. We need to exercise faith in order to partake of all that is ours in Christ. We should not consider ourselves poor, just as a poor woman who has married a rich man should no longer think of herself as poor. Even though she may feel poor, she must practice applying the fact that the riches of her husband belong to her. In like manner, because we are one with Christ, we should not regard ourselves as in poverty. To the contrary, we need to have a full realization of what we have in Christ.</p>
<p>In their prayers, some Christians like to declare how poor, pitiful, and low they are. This kind of prayer is without faith or assurance. We need to believe with full assurance that we are one with the rich, all-inclusive Christ, with the One who is the embodiment of all the fullness of the Triune God. If we realize this with full assurance, we will never consider ourselves poor.</p>
<p>We should not believe our feelings about ourselves but look away to Christ (Heb. 12:2). We need to exercise our faith to realize what He is, what He has passed through, what He has obtained and attained, and where He is today. Since He is in the third heaven and we are one with Him, we also are in the third heaven. We have been placed into the Christ who is unsearchably rich.</p>
<p>In Christ we do not lack anything. We should not talk about how much we lack. Because we are in Christ, we lack nothing. In Him is the fullness, the perfection, the completion. Actually, He Himself is the fullness, perfection, and completion. Because we are in Him, we also are complete and perfect. We are those who possess the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 3:8 Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ. We are more than billionaires because the riches we have are greater than can be counted. We simply have no idea what vast riches we possess in Christ. Often we have prayed: &ldquo;Lord, I am poor and pitiful.&rdquo; But we need to pray in this way: &ldquo;Lord, I thank You that I am rich, complete, and full. Lord Jesus, because I am in You, I am short of nothing.&rdquo; We should tell the Lord, the angels, and even the demons that we are richer than any earthly billionaire because we are in the Christ whose riches are unsearchable.</p>
<p>When we are rooted in Christ as the soil, the first thing to take place is that we are made full in Him; we are filled with all the divine riches to become His expression (vv. 8, 17, 19). In Christ as the soil we are filled, completed, perfected, satisfied, and thoroughly supplied; we do not lack anything (cf. Phil. 1:19). Christ as the soil is the history and mystery of God with all the riches of His person and processes (Col. 2:2). Christ as the soil is the Head of all rule and authority (v. 10). In Christ as the soil there is an element with the killing power which puts the flesh to death (v. 11), an element which causes us to be buried (v. 12a), an element which causes us to be raised up (v. 12b), an element which vivifies us (v. 13), an element which wipes out the handwriting in ordinances (v. 14), and an element which is victorious over the evil spirits in the atmosphere (v. 15).</p>
<p>Christ as the soil is the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily. Since Christ is the good land in which we have been rooted, we have been rooted in this fullness; in it we have been made full, complete, and perfect. We have no need whatsoever. Having been planted into this fullness, we should simply absorb nourishment from it. As we do so, we will find that we have no lack.</p>
<p>Before we were rooted in Christ as the good land, we did not have anything positive. Instead, we were involved with the flesh, the ordinances, and the power of darkness. But now that we have been rooted in the good land, the fullness has become ours, and we are supplied with every positive thing. In this all-inclusive and extensive fullness, we have everything: God, an uplifted humanity, divine attributes, and human virtues. Because this fullness is all-inclusive, it accomplishes everything for us, it fully satisfies and supplies us, and it makes us full, perfect, and complete. How rich is the soil in which we have been rooted! It supplies us with everything, and we have no lack. We have the all-inclusive, inexhaustible fullness. In this universe there is such a thing that Paul calls the fullness. This fullness dwells in Christ bodily. In Him, the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, we are made full.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Christ Being the Head of All Rule and Authority</h2>
<p>In 2:10 Paul indicates that the Christ in whom we have been made full is the Head of all rule and authority. As previously mentioned, the rule and authority spoken of here refer to the angelic powers, in particular the fallen angels who still occupy positions of power. According to the full revelation of the Bible, after God created the universe, He placed it under the control of an archangel and other leading angels. When this archangel rebelled against God and became Satan, many of the leading angels who assisted him in ruling the universe became the evil rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. These are described in Ephesians 6:12 as the rulers, the authorities, the world-rulers of this darkness, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. These angelic powers rule over the nations. For this reason, the book of Daniel mentions both the prince of Greece and the prince of Persia (10:20). (A prince here denotes one of the angelic powers or rulers.) This means that all the nations on earth today are under the rule of authorities in the heavenlies; however, not all of these are evil. Nevertheless, Christ is the Head of all rule and authority.</p>
<p>Since Christ is our perfection and completion, we do not need other rulers and authorities as objects of adoration, for He is the Head of all rule and authority. We should remember that the Colossians had been led astray to the worship of angels. Therefore, Paul told them that since Christ is the Head of all the angels and since we are in Him, there is no need for us to worship angels. We are identified with the One who is the Head of all the angels, and in Him we have been made full. If we are clear about this, we will never be deluded into worshipping angels. Rather, we will have the proper knowledge that, in a very real sense, because we are one with the Head of the angels, we are higher than they are. Actually, we are partners of the Christ who is the Head over them, and in Him we are complete. The fact that we have been made full in Christ who is the Head of all rule and authority is versus the worship of angels. Because we are one with Christ, we should never worship angels.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. In Him the Saints Being Circumcised,<br />
in the Putting Off of the Body of the Flesh,<br />
in the Circumcision of Christ, Buried Together with Him<br />
in Baptism and Raised Together with Him</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:11 Paul says, &ldquo;In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.&rdquo; Here Paul is dealing with Judaizers who prize and boast in their circumcision. Paul thus declares that in Christ, in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, the saints have been circumcised. This circumcision is not merely to cut off a piece of flesh but to put off the entire body of the flesh. It is also the circumcision of Christ, that is, to be crucified with Him, buried together with Him in baptism, and raised together with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Being Circumcised with a Circumcision<br />
Not Made with Hands</h2>
<p>In verse 11 Paul speaks of a circumcision not made with hands. This certainly is different from that practiced by the Jews, which was carried out with a knife. In addition to that physical circumcision, there is another kind of circumcision, the circumcision in Christ, which is not made with hands. This is spiritual circumcision and refers to the proper baptism, which puts off the body of the flesh by the effectual virtue of the death of Christ.</p>
<p>The circumcision in Christ involves the death of Christ and the power of the Spirit. When Christ was crucified, His crucifixion was the genuine, practical, and universal circumcision. His crucifixion cut off all the negative things. These negative things include our flesh, our natural man, and the self. However, along with the death of Christ we need the Spirit as the power. If we have Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion without the Spirit as the power, we will have no means by which to apply Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion to us and to execute its effect upon us. The crucifixion of Christ becomes practical and effective by means of the Spirit. By the Spirit as the power, Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion is applied to us. Then under the power of the Spirit, we are circumcised in an actual and practical way. This is the circumcision in Christ, a circumcision not made with hands. It is a circumcision not made with hands because it was accomplished by the death of Christ, and it is applied, executed, and carried out by the powerful Spirit. This is the circumcision we have all received.</p>
<p>In Christ, on the one hand, we have been made full, and, on the other hand, we have been circumcised. Because we have been made full in Him, we are short of nothing. Because we have been circumcised in Him, all the negative things have been removed. Regarding the positive things, we are complete. Regarding the negative things, everything has been cleared up, and we have no problems. Therefore, regarding the positive things, we are not short of anything, and regarding the negative things, we are no longer troubled by anything.</p>
<p>However, we need to exercise faith and not look at ourselves. We must turn our eyes away from our feelings and from our apparent situation. According to our apparent situation, we are short of everything positive and are troubled by everything negative. But according to the facts, we are not in ourselves&mdash;we are in Christ. Because we are in Him, we have been made full positively, and we have been circumcised to clear away the negative things.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) In the Putting Off of the Body of the Flesh</h2>
<p>In verse 11 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the putting off of the body of the flesh.&rdquo; This means to strip off something, as one would strip off clothes. The circumcision that took place by the death of Christ and is applied by the powerful Spirit accomplishes the putting off of the body of the flesh. Our body of flesh was crucified on the cross with Christ and has been put off. Regarding this, we must again exercise our faith and not consider our self and our apparent situation. Let us exercise faith and say, &ldquo;Amen! The body of the flesh has been put off on the cross and by the powerful Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) In the Circumcision of Christ</h2>
<p>The spiritual circumcision in verse 11 must be in the circumcision of Christ, not with a circumcision made with hands. The circumcision of Christ is by His crucifixion. Our flesh has been crossed out by His death on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) Being Buried Together with Him in Baptism</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the circumcision in Christ takes place through baptism. In verse 12 Paul says, &ldquo;Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead.&rdquo; We have been buried together with Christ in baptism. To be buried in baptism is to put off, to strip off, the body of the flesh. Moreover, in Christ we have been raised together through the faith of the operation of God. In baptism there is the burial aspect, which is the termination of our flesh, and the raising aspect, which is the germination of our spirit. In the raising aspect we are made alive in Christ with the divine life.</p>
<p>In this verse Paul points out that this is through the faith of the operation of God. Faith is not of ourselves; it is the gift of God (Eph. 2:8). The more we turn to God and contact Him, the more faith we have. The Lord is the Author and Perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12:2). The more we abide in Him, the more we are infused with Him as our faith. It is through this living faith in the operation of the living God that we experience the resurrection life, signified by the raising aspect of baptism. Genuine baptism involves an operation in which we are buried and terminated. This operation involves the exercise of faith. The One who carries out the operation is the Spirit. Whenever we baptize someone, there is the need for the exercise of faith to realize that an operation is taking place to terminate the old being of the one who is to be baptized. We must have faith in the operation of God, the Triune God, who raised Christ from the dead.</p>
<p>Whenever we baptize a new believer, we must realize that this one is being placed into a divine operation that will terminate him and bury him. We must exercise faith in the operation of the Triune God. By faith we have the reality of the termination and burial of the old man, the self, the flesh, and the natural life. The operating Triune God will honor this faith by making these things real. This burial and termination of the old man through baptism is the real circumcision.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(5) Having Died with Christ<br />
from the Elements of the World</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:20 Paul points out that we have died with Christ from the elements of the world. These elements include Jewish observances, heathen ordinances, and philosophy. They also include mysticism and asceticism. The elements of the world are the elementary principles of worldly society, the rudimentary principles invented by mankind and practiced in society. With Christ we have died to these elements of the world. When Christ was crucified, we were crucified also. In His crucifixion we were released from the elementary principles of the world.</p>
<p>Since we have died with Christ from the elements of the world, Paul in verse 20 asks the believers in Colossae why, as living in the world, they continued to subject themselves to ordinances, that is, to the elementary principles from which they had died in Christ. The world in this verse refers not to the physical earth but to human society, to mankind. Therefore, Paul is asking the believers why they still subjected themselves to ordinances as if they were still living in human society.</p>
<p>In verse 21 Paul lists some of these ordinances: &ldquo;Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch.&rdquo; These are rules and regulations in material things. These rules refer respectively to things that move, to things that are edible, and to things that are tangible. Handling, tasting, and touching include virtually every kind of action. Because these regulations are related to the practice of asceticism, to submit to ordinances concerning handling, tasting, and touching is to practice asceticism.</p>
<p>Since we have received the circumcision in Christ, there is no need for us to practice asceticism. Being circumcised in the circumcision of Christ is versus asceticism (vv. 20-22). Those who have been buried and terminated and who are now resting in the tomb, have no need of asceticism. There is no reason for them to treat their bodies severely. To do so is against the spiritual principle. According to the spiritual principle, we have been terminated and have put off the body of the flesh, the thing that asceticism attempts to deal with. Every form of asceticism attempts to deal with the lusts of the flesh. According to the teaching and practice of asceticism, treating the body severely eliminates lusts and restricts indulgence. This is the basic principle of asceticism. This severe treatment of the body is &ldquo;not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh&rdquo; (v. 23). The various practices of asceticism are not effective in restricting the indulgence of the flesh. Paul&rsquo;s concept in Colossians 2 was that since the believers in Christ have been circumcised in the circumcision of Christ, which was accomplished by Christ&rsquo;s death and is applied by the Spirit, and since this is the circumcision in which they have been buried and terminated, there is absolutely no need for the practice of asceticism. To mistreat the body in an attempt to restrict the indulgence of the flesh is foolish and of no avail. Truly, the circumcision in Christ is versus asceticism.</p>
<p>The experience of Christ&rsquo;s death is versus asceticism. Day by day we should pass through the cross. This means that no matter what we have done or no matter what has happened to us, the cross takes care of everything. If we are made unhappy in some way by others, we need to apply the cross to our feeling of unhappiness; then the feeling of unhappiness will disappear. This indicates that our way is the cross, not asceticism or any severe treatment of the self. Realizing that we have already died in Christ, we should have a consciousness of the cross. If we realize that we have died in Christ, we will be in resurrection as a new person. We not only have Christ, the unique person, who is versus all things; we also have the cross, the unique way, which is versus all other ways.</p>
<p>As we drive, we come to many intersections; every intersection is a cross. Only by passing through many crosses can we get to our destination. Speaking of spiritual experience, we also must pass through many crosses before we can reach the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). Just as we cannot travel very far geographically without crossing an intersection, so we cannot progress spiritually without passing through the cross. Only when we arrive at the New Jerusalem will we cease to pass through the cross, for by that time all the negative things will have been eliminated (cf. v. 8). Until we come to the New Jerusalem, we need to pass through the cross day by day in our walk with the Lord.</p>
<p>It is a healthy spiritual practice to pass through the cross every night when we go to bed. By applying the cross at the end of each day, we may rest very well during the night. At bedtime we need to apply the cross to every problem and to every negative, natural, or sinful thing. We may pray, &ldquo;Lord, I want all these things to pass through the cross. I do not want to go to sleep with any natural, sinful, negative, or worldly element that has not been dealt with. When I go to bed, Lord, I want to be a person who has been crossed out.&rdquo; Because we have Christ as the unique person and the cross as the unique way, we do not need asceticism. Furthermore, we do not even need to make up our minds with respect to certain things. Such a practice does not work. What we need to do is simply lie down through the cross at night, have a restful sleep, and then rise up in the morning in resurrection. We need to be those who pass through one cross after another. We need to daily pass through the intersection of the cross.</p>
<p>Apart from the cross as God&rsquo;s one way, we should have no ordinances and no particular ways or practices. The way which God has ordained, uplifted, and honored is the cross of Christ. The cross is our only way. Only the cross can enable us to be one and in perfect harmony. We all need to pass through the cross. If we do not experience the cross, we cannot have the proper church life. All the saints must learn to daily pass through the cross. By passing through all manner of crosses, large and small, we will have oneness and harmony in the church life.</p>
<p>In the church life it is possible to have oneness without harmony. In order to have a sweet, harmonious oneness, we all must daily pass through the cross. We should not argue that we are right and that others are wrong. The more we dispute in this way, the less we pass through the cross. To repeat, the way to our destination is through the intersection of the cross. We should not avoid any cross. On the contrary, we should pass through all the crosses that we encounter in the Christian life, in the family life, and in the church life. In married life and in the church life in particular, we need to pass through the cross daily, even hourly. In Ephesians 4:26 Paul exhorts us not to allow the sun to go down on our indignation. This means that we should let go of our anger by passing through the cross. If we have a daily life of passing through the cross, there will be harmony both in the family life and in the church life. God has given us one person&mdash;the all-inclusive Christ&mdash;and one way&mdash;the cross.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(62)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider Christ as the mystery of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. The Body (the Reality) of All the Shadows</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:16 and 17 Paul says, &ldquo;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.&rdquo; These verses reveal that as the mystery of God, Christ is the body, the reality, of all the shadows.</p>
<p>In verse 16 Paul covers matters related to daily life, weekly life, monthly life, and yearly life. Eating and drinking are daily, the Sabbaths weekly, the new moons monthly, and the feasts yearly. All the aspects of our living are shadows of Christ. Eating and drinking signify daily satisfaction and strengthening (1 Cor. 10:3-4), and the Sabbath signifies weekly completion and rest (Matt. 11:28-29). Without completion, we cannot enjoy rest. Rest always comes from completion and satisfaction. When we have finished a certain matter and are satisfied with it, we are then able to be at rest. After God completed His work of creation on the sixth day, He enjoyed rest on the seventh day (Gen. 2:1-3). Hence, the Sabbath signifies completion and rest on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>A new moon signifies a monthly new beginning with light in darkness (John 1:5; 8:12). Just as the new moon marked a new beginning in Old Testament times, so Christ affords us a new beginning with light in darkness today. Before we came to the Lord, we were in darkness, like all unbelieving Jews today. But after believing in Him, we now enjoy Christ as our new moon with light in darkness.</p>
<p>The feasts signify yearly enjoyment and joy (1 Cor. 5:8). Three times a year, God&rsquo;s chosen people came together for the annual feasts, which were times of enjoyment, of rejoicing together before the Lord. Although the feasts were enjoyable, they were simply shadows of Christ. He is the real food, drink, completion, rest, new moon, and feast. Daily we eat and drink Him, weekly we have completion and rest in Him, monthly we experience a new beginning in Him, and throughout the year He is our joy and enjoyment. Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly Christ is to us the reality of every positive thing.</p>
<p>All these items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come. The body in Colossians 2:17, like a man&rsquo;s physical body, is the substance. The rituals in the law are a shadow of the real things in the gospel, like the shadow of a man&rsquo;s body. Christ is the reality of the gospel. All the good things in the gospel belong to Him. This all-inclusive Christ is the focus of God&rsquo;s economy. Hence, there is no room for Jewish religion or Greek philosophy&mdash;there is room only for the all-inclusive Christ. Although Paul was once very strong in Judaism, when he received the revelation concerning Christ, he realized that both Greek philosophy and Jewish tradition were nothing. In God&rsquo;s economy only Christ counts for anything.</p>
<p>As the body of shadows, the all-inclusive Christ is the reality of all the positive things in the universe (cf. Rom. 1:20; Eph. 3:18). Because the universe with the billions of things and persons in it was created for the purpose of describing Christ, He, in revealing Himself to His disciples, could easily find in any environment something or someone to serve as an illustration of Himself (Col. 1:15-17; John 1:51; 10:9-11; 12:24; Matt. 12:41-42). The Old Testament uses six major categories of things as types to describe Christ: human beings, animals, plants, minerals, offerings, and foods. Christ is typified by human beings, such as Adam (Rom. 5:14), Melchizedek (Heb. 7:1-3), Isaac (Matt. 1:1), Jonah (12:41), and Solomon (v. 42). Christ is typified by animals, such as a lamb (John 1:29), a lion, an ox, an eagle (Ezek. 1:10), and a gazelle (S. S. 2:9). Christ, who is the tree of life (Gen. 2:9), is typified by plants, such as the vine tree (John 15:1), the apple tree (S. S. 2:3), the fig tree, the pomegranate tree, and the olive tree (Deut. 8:8); the different parts of a tree are also types of Christ, such as the sprout, the stump, the branch, the root, the shoot, and the fruit (Isa. 11:1, 10; 4:2; Luke 1:42; Rev. 5:5).</p>
<p>Christ is also typified by minerals, such as iron, copper, silver, and gold (Deut. 8:9b, 13), and different kinds of stone: the living stone (1 Pet. 2:4), the rock (1 Cor. 10:4), the cornerstone (Matt. 21:42), the topstone (Zech. 4:7), the foundation stone, and precious stone (1 Cor. 3:11-12). The offerings that typify Christ include the burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, trespass offering, heave offering, wave offering, and drink offering (Lev. 1&mdash;7; Exo. 29:26-28; Num. 28:7-10; cf. John 4:24). Christ is typified by foods, such as bread, wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, milk, and honey (6:35; Deut. 8:8-9a; 26:9). In the New Testament Christ is the Spirit of reality who makes the untraceable riches of all that He is real to us, guiding us into Himself as the divine reality (John 14:6a; 1 John 5:6; John 14:17; 16:13). The elements of the reality of all the types are in the Spirit, and the Spirit transfuses and dispenses all these riches into us through the Lord&rsquo;s words (Phil. 1:19; John 6:63; Col. 3:16; Eph. 6:17-18; Rev. 2:7).</p>
<p>We need to experience Christ as the reality of every positive thing in every part of our daily life. We who believe in Christ should consider all things and evaluate all things according to Christ, who is everything to us in a practical way. Christ, the mystery of God and the substance of every positive thing, is everything to us: our breath, drink, food, light, clothing, and our dwelling place (John 20:22; 4:10, 14; 7:37-39a; 6:35, 57; 1:4; 8:12; Gal. 3:27; John 15:5, 7a). As we consider all the positive things in the universe, we should evaluate them according to Christ. If we consider all things according to Christ, our daily living will be changed. What a tremendous revelation this is! The Christ whom we have received is not a narrow Christ. On the contrary, He is full, rich, unlimited, and all-inclusive. He is not only our Redeemer, Savior, and life&mdash;He is everything to us.</p>
<p>According to the principle in the Bible, the first in a certain category often includes all the other items in that category. The book of Revelation says that Christ is the Alpha and the Omega (22:13). This does not mean, however, that Christ is only these two letters and not all the letters in between. Because He is the first letter, He is also all the other letters. The principle is the same with respect to the slaughter of the firstborn in the book of Exodus (12:29). The firstborn of the Egyptians represented all the Egyptians. Likewise, when the Bible says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, it implies that Christ includes every item of the creation. This concept is confirmed in Colossians 2, where Paul says that such things as eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are shadows and that Christ is the body, the substance, of these shadows.</p>
<p>Christ, who is superior to all things in Greek philosophy and Jewish religion, is the body, the reality, of all the shadows in the Old Testament, such as feasts, Sabbaths, new moons, eating, and drinking. This is, however, altogether different from pantheism, the satanic belief which identifies God with material things in the universe. According to the Bible, we can say that Christ is the reality of all the positive things in the universe; He is the reality of our food, our drink, and the new moon, a new beginning with light in darkness. But we cannot turn this around and say that our literal food, clothing, and houses are Christ. That would be the grossly heretical doctrine of pantheism. This is devilish, and we repudiate it without reservation. Nevertheless, we have the biblical ground to say that Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe: He is the door, the pasture, the Shepherd, the light, and the life (John 10:9, 14; 8:12; 14:6). Therefore, we can say that Christ is everything to us, the reality of all positive things.</p>
<p>Many things in the environment of our daily living are also shadows of Christ. For example, the food that we eat is a shadow, not the real food. The real food is Christ. Christ is also the real drink. The clothing that we wear to cover us, to beautify us, and to keep us warm is also a shadow of Christ. Christ is the One who truly covers our nakedness, who keeps us warm, and who imparts beauty to us. Christ is also our true dwelling place and real rest. The houses in which we live are a shadow of Christ as our dwelling place. The rest that we enjoy at night is also a figure of Christ as our rest. Even the satisfaction that we enjoy after a good meal is not the real satisfaction but a shadow of Christ as the reality of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Every day, week, month, and year we need Christ. All the positive things in our daily life, weekly life, monthly life, and yearly life must be Christ. Christ must become everything to us, not merely in a doctrinal way but in the way of experience. Christ should be our completion, rest, new beginning, enjoyment, joy, food, drink, and satisfaction. Although Christ is universally vast, He is also all the detailed aspects of our practical daily living.</p>
<p>Whatever we do day by day should remind us of Christ as the reality of that thing. As we eat our meals, we should take Christ as the real food and pray to Him in this way: &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I do not simply thank You for this food and take it into me. Lord, I take You as the reality of this food.&rdquo; When we drink some beverage, we should also drink Christ. As we put on our clothing, we should be reminded that Christ is the real clothing, and we should experience Him as such. As we put on our material clothing, we should also put on Christ. It is easy to enjoy Christ in this way. Even our breathing should remind us of the necessity of breathing Christ spiritually.</p>
<p>If we follow the practice of taking Christ as the reality of all the material things in our daily life, our daily walk will be revolutionized and transformed. It will be full of Christ. When we eat and drink, we shall take Christ as our spiritual food and drink. Everything that we do will remind us to contact Christ, to enjoy Christ, to experience Christ, and to have Christ as our everything. To practice this day by day is truly to enjoy Christ.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s mathematics, only Christ has value. Doctrines and opinions do not matter. What matters is the Christ who is for our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly life. If Christ is truly everything to us in our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly life, there will be no need for us to express our opinion. We have Christ as our unique factor, reason, element, and source.</p>
<p>It is significant that after speaking of Christ as the body of the shadows, Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Let no one defraud you by judging you unworthy of your prize&rdquo; (Col. 3:18). According to the context, the prize is the enjoyment of Christ as the body of all the shadows. The enjoyment of Christ is truly a prize. Today we may enjoy Christ as our reward, our prize. This prize is not only the objective Christ but particularly the subjective enjoyment of Christ. According to verses 16 through 18, to be defrauded of our prize is to be defrauded of the subjective enjoyment of Christ daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. The Jewish believers were distracted from Christ by the Judaizers, whereas the Gentile believers were carried off by certain philosophical concepts. Both were defrauded of the subjective experience and enjoyment of Christ. We need to check whether we experience and enjoy Christ in a practical way daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. It is very possible that we, like the Colossians, have also been defrauded of our prize. We should not allow anyone to defraud us of this prize, and we need to enjoy Christ in all the small details of our daily living.</p>
<p>According to 1:26, the word of God completed through the ministry of Paul was &ldquo;the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints.&rdquo; This mystery is Christ in us, the hope of glory (v. 27). Although we may have considerable knowledge of the Bible, we do not have the completion of the divine revelation unless we adequately experience Christ daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. Our need is for the subjective Christ to become our enjoyment to complete the divine revelation within us. If we are short in the experience and enjoyment of Christ, we are also short concerning God&rsquo;s revelation. His revelation needs the experiential Christ as its completion.</p><h2 class="head4">g. The Head of the Body, out from Whom<br />
All the Body Grows with the Growth of God</h2>
<p>In 2:19 Paul speaks of &ldquo;holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.&rdquo; The heresy of angel worship distracted the believers in Colossae from holding Christ as the Head. God&rsquo;s economy is to head up all things in Christ through His Body, the church, thereby making Christ the center of all things (Eph. 1:10, 22-23). The device of the subtle one is to carry the saints away and to cause the Body to collapse. The heresy at Colossae caused the saints to be severed from the Head. This damaged the Body. Paul&rsquo;s revelation was to uplift Christ and to safeguard and build up the Body. We need to be preserved in Christ for the church life.</p>
<p>To be preserved in Christ for the church life is to hold Him as the Head, out from whom the Body grows with the growth of God. Growth is a matter of life, which is God Himself. As the Body of Christ, the church should not be deprived of Christ, who is the embodiment of God as the source of life. By holding Christ, the church grows with the growth of God, with the increase of God as life.</p>
<p>This growth takes place as all the Body is being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews. Joints are for the supply of the Body, whereas sinews are for the knitting together of the members of the Body. In the church some members are joints and others are sinews. By means of the joints and sinews, the Body grows. This indicates that we cannot grow with the growth of God individualistically; we need to be in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Holding the Head</h2>
<p>To understand properly what it means to hold the Head, we need to consider Colossians 2:16 and 17, where Paul tells us that Christ is the body, the substance, the reality, of all the shadows, such as eating, drinking, Sabbaths, new moons, and feasts. Based upon this fact, Paul warns us not to allow anyone to purposely defraud us of our prize, the subjective enjoyment of Christ. Those who seek to defraud us are the ones who stand on things which they have seen and who do not hold the Head. Thus, there is a connection between Christ as the body of the shadows and holding the Head. In other words, the Christ who is the reality of all positive things is the One who is the Head of the Body. If we would know what it means to hold the Head, we must know what it is to enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things. Without enjoying Christ in this way, we cannot experientially hold Him as the Head. Therefore, we can say that to hold the Head is simply to enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things.</p>
<p>The genuine Christian life is a life of enjoying Christ. We need to enjoy the Lord all day long. Whenever we enjoy Christ continually, we automatically hold Him as the Head. Thus, the best way to hold Christ as the Head is to enjoy Him. There is no better way to hold Christ than to eat Him. Just as we hold food by taking it into us and eating it, so we hold Christ by eating Him.</p>
<p>In 2:16-19 Paul takes a great leap from Christ as everything for our enjoyment to Christ as the Head. As we enjoy Christ as our food, drink, air, and everything, we are uplifted to the height of our experience of holding Christ as the Head. But if we stop enjoying Christ, we immediately stop holding Him as the Head. Only when we enjoy Him do we also hold Him. This is not a doctrine learned from theology books; it is a fact of Christian experience. To hold the Head is to enjoy Christ continually. We are vessels made to contain Him, and we hold Him by eating, drinking, and breathing Him.</p>
<p>Holding the Head is also equal to abiding in Christ (John 15:4). To hold the Head implies that we are not detached, or severed, from Him. At the time that Paul wrote to the Colossians, they had been somewhat detached from Christ by their culture. Culture can be a form of insulation which keeps us from Christ. To hold the Head is to remain in Christ without any insulation between us and Him.</p>
<p>For the Body to hold the Head means that the Body does not allow itself to be separated from the Head. If we truly hold Christ as the Head, we will not be separated from Him by anything. When we live by our culture instead of by Christ, we separate ourselves from Christ as the Head and are defrauded of our prize, which is the enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because Christ&rsquo;s headship is in resurrection, the enjoyment of Christ spontaneously brings us into resurrection and saves us from our natural being. We all are natural. If we are not brought into resurrection through the enjoyment of Christ, we will remain in our natural person. The more we enjoy Him, the less natural we are.</p>
<p>The enjoyment of Christ also brings us into the ascension. The more we enjoy Him, the more we are in the heavenlies experientially. This means that through the enjoyment of Christ, we become heavenly. We are not only no longer natural but also no longer earthly. The enjoyment of Christ causes us to be both in resurrection and in ascension. The more we enjoy Christ, the more we are in the heavens. Therefore, to hold Christ as the Head is to be in the heavens in our experience. It is also true to say that to be in the heavens is to hold the Head. Experientially, holding the Head and being in the heavens are one and the same.</p>
<p>If in our experience we temporarily abandon Christ and do not continue holding Him as the Head, we will sense that we are earthly. Whenever we are earthly, we are not holding the Head, but if in our daily life we consistently enjoy Christ, we will hold Him as the Head and be in the heavens in our experience. Then we will be a heavenly people.</p>
<p>According to Colossians 3:1-4, our living should be in the heavens, where God&rsquo;s throne is. On the one hand, Christ as our Head is in our spirit (1:27; 2 Tim. 4:22); on the other hand, He is in the heavens, not on earth (Col. 3:1). Only when we are in the heavens do we hold Him as the Head. To enjoy Christ is to hold the Head, and to hold the Head is to be in the heavens.</p>
<p>We can be experientially in the heavens only by enjoying Christ, the Head, as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; If Christ were only the Head and not the Spirit, there would be no way for us to contact Him or hold Him experientially. But although Christ&rsquo;s position is that of the Head, in our experience He is the life-giving Spirit. According to 2 Timothy 4:22, the Lord, who is the Spirit, is now with our spirit. In the heavens Christ is the Head, but in our spirit He is the Spirit. Therefore, to hold Christ as the Head is not only to enjoy Him and to be in the heavens; it is also to be in our spirit. If we would hold the Head, we must be in spirit.</p>
<p>In Colossians 2:18 Paul uses the expression <em>vainly puffed up by his mind set on the flesh.</em> The mind is part of the soul, and the flesh is related to the physical body. Anyone who is puffed up by the mind of the flesh does not hold Christ as the Head, for he is in his fleshly mind, not in the spirit. Whenever we are in the mind or in the flesh, we are not holding the Head. But when we turn from the flesh and from the mind to the spirit, we automatically hold Christ as the Head. If we linger in our fleshly mind, we will not be able to touch Christ or hold Him. But if we turn to the spirit, we will hold the Head, who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to hold Christ as the Head, we should enjoy Christ, be in the heavens, and be in our spirit. From our experience we know that these three matters go together. When we enjoy Christ, we are in the heavens and in our spirit, not in the mind or in the flesh. To be in the spirit is experientially to be in the third heaven. According to the Bible, the Holy of Holies is both in the third heaven and in our spirit (Heb. 10:19; 4:14, 16). Whenever we turn to the spirit, we are in the heavens enjoying the Lord. This is the way to hold the Head.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Out from Him All the Body Growing<br />
with the Growth of God</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:17 Paul says that the body, the reality, of all the shadows is of Christ, but in verse 19 he speaks not of Christ but of holding the Head. The reason for the change in terminology from Christ to the Head is that our enjoyment of the Lord causes us to become conscious of the Body. If we enjoy Christ continually, we will not continue to be individualistic. The saints who are individualistic are those who do not consistently enjoy the Lord. The more we enjoy Christ, the more we become Body-conscious. We should touch the Lord in the morning, but in the evening we should come to the church meetings. It is not normal to enjoy the Lord during the day and neglect the meetings of the church, which is His Body. Even if our environment does not allow us to attend all the meetings, inwardly we should have the sense that our whole inner being is with the saints in the church meeting. This consciousness of the Body comes from the enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>What we enjoy of Christ day by day is actually something of Him as the Head. This is the reason that when we enjoy Christ, He causes us to become conscious of the Body. The more we enjoy Christ, the more intense is our desire for the Body. However, if we fail to contact the Lord for a period of time, we will automatically neglect the church life or lose interest in the meetings. The less we contact the Lord, the more we become critical of the church or the saints. We have an eye for the faults and shortcomings of others. This shortage of the enjoyment of Christ opens the door for the enemy, Satan, to come in to make us critical of other members of the Body. But if we begin again to enjoy the Lord, the door will gradually close. Eventually, if we continually enjoy Christ, the door will be completely shut. Then, instead of criticizing the church, we will praise the Lord for the church life, and we will testify how much we love it. What brings about such a change is not admonition or correction but the recovery of the enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>The dear, precious One whom we enjoy as our food, drink, and breath is the Head of the Body. Because Paul had a thorough realization of this, he could leap from Christ as the reality of all positive things for our enjoyment to the matter of Christ as the Head. Since the Christ we enjoy as our everything is the Head of the Body, the more we enjoy Him, the more we become Body-conscious. This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ is not an individualistic matter. It is a Body matter. We need to enjoy Christ as members of the Body in a corporate way.</p>
<p>In 2:19 Paul speaks of &ldquo;all the Body.&rdquo; The enjoyment of Christ keeps us one as members of the Body. The more we enjoy Christ, the more we love the other members of the Body. The enjoyment of Christ causes us to love everyone in the church life. Even those whom we find difficult to love become dear and precious to us. However, if we do not continue to enjoy Christ, we will despise certain ones in the church. Actually, the church and the saints remain the same; it is our attitude that changes. But if the supply of Christ is ministered to us and we begin to enjoy Him again, all the members of the Body will once again become lovable to us. We will have the pleasant realization that, as members of the Body, we love all the other members.</p>
<p>It is the enjoyment of Christ which causes Him to be the Head in our experience. Christ cannot be our Head subjectively and experientially unless we enjoy Him. We may be told again and again that Christ is the Head of the Body, but we will not have any consciousness of Him as the Head unless we enjoy Him regularly. The more we enjoy Christ, the more we will realize experientially that the Christ whom we enjoy is the Head of the Body. This realization will make us conscious of the Body and cause us to love all the members of the Body.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:19 speaks of the supply and of the Body being knit together. When the Body is supplied and knit together by holding the Head, the Body grows with the growth of God. The phrase <em>out from whom</em> in this verse indicates that the Body grows out from the Head, for all the supply comes from the Head. In one sense, Christ is the Head; in another sense, He is the soil (v. 7). As we absorb the riches of the soil, we hold the Head. Likewise, to receive the supply from the Head is to absorb the riches from the soil.</p>
<p>When we enjoy Christ in the heavens and in our spirit, we hold the Head and absorb His riches. Then out from the Head something will proceed to produce the growth of God in us. This means that more of the element of God is added into our being and thereby into the Body. This causes the Body to grow with the growth, the increase, of God.</p>
<p>In order to have genuine growth, we must first be rooted in Christ, our good land. We are plants rooted in Christ as the soil. As a tree grows, it absorbs water and nourishing elements from the soil in which it is rooted. As these riches are absorbed by the tree, they become the increase of the tree. The tree grows with the increase of the riches from the soil. In like manner, we are living plants rooted in Christ as our soil. What we absorb of Christ into us&mdash;the element of the riches of Himself as the soil&mdash;becomes the increase of God within us. Our land is Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. Therefore, the land is the Triune God. This means that when we absorb the riches of the soil, we absorb the riches of the Triune God. Actually, we absorb the Triune God Himself. Through this absorption, we take more of God into us. This increase of God within us is what we mean by the growth of God.</p>
<p>The genuine growth in life is to grow with the growth of God, that is, to grow with the increase of God, the addition of God. In Himself, God cannot and does not need to grow. He is eternal, perfect, and complete. However, there is the need for God to grow in us. We all need more of the increase, the addition, of God within us. We need to grow with the growth of God; that is, we need God to increase, to grow, in us.</p>
<p>God is rich in every way. He is rich in glory and in all the divine attributes. He is rich in love, kindness, mercy, light, life, power, and strength. God&rsquo;s riches are endless. Now this rich God is adding Himself into us. God&rsquo;s riches are the element and substance by which we grow. God is real, rich, and substantial, and we need to absorb Him.</p>
<p>Our God today is the processed, all-inclusive Spirit, and we have a spirit with which to absorb Him. Thus, we must exercise our spirit to stay in His presence to absorb Him. This takes time. Although we all have experienced absorbing the riches of God, our experience is not yet adequate. For this reason, we must spend more time to absorb Him. We should not spend so much time in our mind, emotion, and will, but spend more time in our spirit to adore the Lord, to praise Him, to offer thanks to Him, and to speak to Him freely. As we fellowship with Him in this way, we will absorb His riches, and He will add more of Himself into us. The more God is added into us, the more growth He gives to us. This is the way God causes the growth.</p>
<p>In summary, to hold Christ as the Head is to enjoy Him as the body of all the shadows continually, to be in the heavens, and to remain in our spirit. Through holding Christ as the Head, we become conscious of the Body because the Christ whom we enjoy as our real food, drink, Sabbaths, new moons, and feasts is the Head who causes us to become conscious of the Body. Experiencing the Body life, we absorb the riches out from the Head. These riches are the elements of God, which become in the members of the Body the increase of God by which the whole Body grows. Therefore, the growth of the Body is the product of enjoying Christ, holding Him as the Head and absorbing His riches.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(63)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">82. The Life of the Saints</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:1-17 Christ is presented as the life of the saints. In verse 4 Paul speaks of &ldquo;Christ our life.&rdquo; This indicates that the mysterious Christ is our life. This marvelous life, which is ours, is described in many wonderful aspects of Christ in the first two chapters of Colossians, such as the portion of the saints and the mystery of God (1:12; 2:2). Today we may live by this life. Christ as the life of the saints is the highest enjoyment; no other enjoyment is superior to Christ as our life.</p>
<p>The extensive, all-inclusive Christ is subjective to us, for He dwells in us as our hope of glory (1:27) and is our life (3:4). Nothing can be more subjective to us than our own life. In fact, our life is us. Our life cannot be separated from our person. Since Christ is our life, He cannot be separated from us. To say that Christ is our life means that Christ becomes us. Christ cannot be our life without actually becoming us. Christ dwells in us, and He is our life. He becomes us in our experience. As Paul says, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). Life is our being. Hence, for Christ to be our life means that He becomes our being. For Christ to become our being is for Christ to become us.</p>
<p>Christ must be our life in a practical and experiential way. Day by day we need to experience Christ as our life. Christ should be our life within, and we should have one life and living with Him. Because we have another life&mdash;Christ as our life&mdash;we can live another kind of life. That Christ is our life is a strong indication that we are to take Him as life and live by Him, that we are to live Him in our daily life in order to experience the universally extensive Christ so that all He is and has attained and obtained will not remain objective but will become our subjective experience.</p>
<p>We need to be one with the Lord Jesus just as He is one with the Father. In John 14:10 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.&rdquo; This indicates that the Father works in the Son&rsquo;s speaking. Although the Father and the Son are two persons, They have only one life and one living. The life of the Father is the life of the Son, and the living of the Son is the living of the Father. In this way the Father and the Son have one life and one living. The principle is the same with Christ and us. Today we and Christ have one life and one living. The Son&rsquo;s life becomes our life, and our living becomes His living. This is what it means to live in union with Christ.</p>
<p>In Colossians 3:3-4 Paul twice speaks of life, indicating thereby that we have one life with Christ. In verse 3 he says that our life &ldquo;is hidden with Christ in God.&rdquo; In verse 4 he goes on to say &ldquo;Christ our life is manifested.&rdquo; Life here is Christ&rsquo;s life becoming our life. If it were merely Christ&rsquo;s life, it could not be called &ldquo;our life.&rdquo; The fact that it is &ldquo;our life&rdquo; indicates that it refers to something which has become ours. However, the life here is not our natural life, the life inherited from Adam. Such a life could never be that which is hidden with Christ in God. God would never allow the natural life inherited from Adam to be hidden in Him. The only life that can be hidden with Christ in God is the divine life, the life of Christ. It is this life which has become our life. Paul&rsquo;s use of the expression <em>our life</em> indicates that we and Christ, and also God Himself, have one life. We should not think that God has one life, that Christ has another life, and that we who believe in Christ have yet another life. Rather, God, Christ, and the believers have one life. The life of God is the life of Christ, and the life of Christ has become our life. We can declare that we have the life that Christ has, the life hidden within God.</p>
<p>The life of the saints is Christ, a wonderful person who is sitting at the right hand of God, with whom the saints were raised, and with whom their life is hidden in God, in order that they may seek the things which are above and may set their mind on the things which are above for them to be manifested with Him in glory (vv. 1-4). Therefore, we must put to death our members which are on the earth, all the fleshly and sinful members, and we must put off the old man with his practices while putting on the new man, which is being renewed according to the image of Him who created him (vv. 5-10). In doing so we are daily being transformed into the image of Christ by being sealed with the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 1:13; 4:30). As the life of the saints, as our life, Christ is also the constituent of the new man because He is all and in all; this means that Christ is us. In the new man there is no race, no nationality, no social rank, for in the new man Christ is all the members and is in all the members. The new man is the spontaneous issue of our taking Christ as our life and living Him.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Sitting at the Right Hand of God</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:1 Paul tells us that Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Saints Raised Together with Him</h2>
<p>In 3:1 Paul also says, &ldquo;If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is.&rdquo; The word <em>raised</em> here refers to the raising aspect of baptism, which is altogether contrary to asceticism. We were raised together with Christ. We are now where Christ is, sitting in the heavens. Hence, we should not practice the things on earth that ascetics do. Rather, we should seek the things which are in the heavens, such as knowing Christ as everything to us so that we may take Him as life and thereby walk in Him.</p>
<p>We need to live by Christ in the heavens, not by the elements of the world. As those who have died with Christ from the things on the earth, especially to things related to asceticism, as those who have been baptized into His death (Rom. 6:3) and raised together with Christ, we should live in the heavens. The heavens are joined to the church; therefore, to live in the heavens is simply to live in the church, for the church and the heavens are one. This is the reason that there should not be any of the elements of the world in the church. Today, to be in the church is to be in the heavens, and to be in the heavens is to be in the church. In our Christian life the church and the heavens are one. As we participate in the church life, we have the sense that we are in the heavens. The church is in the heavens. Here, in this heavenly realm, we have no place for the elements of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Their Life Hidden with Him in God</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:3 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Your life is hidden with Christ in God.&rdquo; Because our life (not our natural life but our spiritual life, which is Christ) is hidden with Christ in God, who is in the heavens, we should no longer care for things on the earth. God in the heavens should be the sphere of our living. With Christ we should live in God. We should note that Paul does not say that our life is hidden with Christ in heaven. Rather, he tells us that our life is hidden in God, in the living, divine person. This indicates that God Himself is the realm, the sphere, in which we should live and walk.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:3 says that our life is hidden with Christ in God. To be with Christ in God means that we are one with Christ. In the words of 1 Corinthians 6:17, he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. We are with Christ in God because we and Christ are subjectively one.</p>
<p>Moreover, 1 Corinthians 12:12 tells us that Christ is the Body. Since we, the believers, are the Body of Christ, this reveals our oneness with Christ. We truly are with Christ. Where Christ is, there we are also. With Christ, our life is hidden in God.</p>
<p>In Colossians 3:1 and 3 we have a matter that deserves our attention. In verse 1 we are told that Christ is at the right hand of God, but according to verse 3, Christ is in God. Therefore, Christ is simultaneously at the right hand of God and also hidden within God.</p>
<p>First, Christ is in us, but eventually we are with Christ in God. Furthermore, according to 3:4, the Christ who dwells in us is our life. Inwardly, we have Christ as our life, and outwardly, we have God as our realm and sphere in which we live and walk. The Christ who dwells in us is life, but the God in whom we are hidden with Christ is the realm of our living. We should be able to testify that we are living not on earth nor even just in heaven but in God.</p>
<p>In ourselves it is not possible for us to be in God. We can be hidden in God only with Christ. On the one hand, Colossians 1:27 tells us that Christ is in us. This indicates that God has been wrought into us. Because Christ is in us, God has been wrought into us. But in 3:3 we are told that we are with Christ in God. This indicates that we have been brought into God. Therefore, God in Christ is now in us as our life, and we are in God as the realm of our living.</p>
<p>We should praise the Lord not only that the Triune God is in us but also that we are in the Triune God. Christ came by incarnation to bring God into us, and He went back to God by crucifixion and resurrection to bring us into God. Concerning this two-way traffic, we should see that Christ came both to work God into us and to bring us into God. Since we have been brought into God and are hidden with Christ in God, God should be the realm of our living. If we live and walk in God, we will be heavenly.</p>
<p>Our position is that we are in Christ. Because we are in Him, we are where He is&mdash;at the right hand of God (v. 1). In John 17:24 the Lord Jesus prayed, &ldquo;Father,...I desire that they also may be with Me where I am.&rdquo; To be where the Lord Jesus is, is not a matter of geography. The Lord is in the Father, and He prayed that the disciples, who were not yet in the Father, would be brought into Him. The Lord prayed, therefore, that they would be where He is.</p>
<p>It is crucial for us to realize that our position is not only in Christ but also in the Father. In the Gospel of John we are told clearly that the Son is in the Father (10:38; 14:10). This means that the Son&rsquo;s position is in the Father. Since our position today is that we are in the Son, in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), we also are in the Father (John 14:20; 1 Thes. 1:1; 2 Thes. 1:1). The Father, of course, is in heaven. Hence, our position also is that we are in heaven. What makes this fact that we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven real to us is that we are one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). It is when we are in the spirit that we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven practically and experientially.</p>
<p>We need to appreciate the word <em>hidden</em> in Colossians 3:3. Today our life is hidden with Christ in God, but one day Christ will appear, and we will be manifested with Him in glory. Although we will be manifested with Christ in the future, now is the time for us to be hidden and to suffer. For this reason, we should not advertise ourselves. The life of a Christian today should be a hidden life.</p>
<p>At present, even Christ is hidden. Consider how much He is criticized, opposed, and attacked. People rebel against Him to such an extent that it almost seems as if He does not exist. Although Christ is suffering from this attack and rebellion, He continues to be silent and hidden.</p>
<p>Our Christian life should be a hidden life, a life hidden with Christ in God. Our church life should also be hidden in God and in the heavens. The church life is a life hidden with Christ in God and in the heavens. As long as we are hidden, we are with Christ in God, in the heavens, and in the church, but when we advertise and promote ourselves, we are outside of Christ and are not with Him.</p>
<p>We need to realize that our life is hidden with Christ in God. This means that our sphere of living should be not the earth but God Himself. Whenever we are in the spirit, we are raised up and have the sense that we are in God, far above everything and everyone. At such a time, we are living in God. But when we are not in the spirit, we have the sense that we are still living on earth. God is high, far above everything and everyone, even far above the heavens. When we are in the spirit, we are living in God.</p>
<p>Our life is the Christ who dwells within us, and this life is hidden with Christ in God; the Christ hidden in God is typified by the manna hidden in the golden pot (Rev. 2:17). In Exodus 16:33 we see that an omerful of manna was placed in a pot and laid up before the Lord to be kept for future generations. Hebrews 9:4 speaks of &ldquo;the golden pot that had the manna.&rdquo; The manna concealed in the golden pot signifies that our life is hidden with Christ in God (Col. 3:3). The Christ hidden in God is the manna hidden in the golden pot.</p>
<p>In the Bible gold signifies the divine nature. According to 2 Peter 1:4, we are partakers of this divine nature. Only the nature of God, the divine nature, can preserve Christ as our hidden manna. Within us we have a golden pot; that is, we have the divine nature. We cannot preserve Christ in our mind or emotion. We can preserve Him only in the divine nature, which we have within us through regeneration. Actually, the divine nature within us is God Himself. The manna in the golden pot indicates that the Christ whom we enjoy as our life supply is preserved in the divine nature, which is now in our inmost being, our spirit. Christ is our special portion of food hidden in the divine nature. When we touch the divine nature, the golden pot, we enjoy Christ as the manna hidden within it.</p>
<p>We need to discern between the natural life and the life that Christ has, the life hidden in God. First, Christ&rsquo;s life is a crucified life (Gal. 2:20); second, it is a resurrected life (John 11:25); and third, it is a life hidden in God (Col. 3:3-4; Matt. 6:1-6, 16-18). These three characteristics distinguish the life that Christ has from our natural life.</p>
<p>The life hidden in God is a crucified life. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He always lived a crucified life. Although He was severely criticized and insulted, He did not weep for Himself. Instead, He extolled the Father, acknowledging the Father&rsquo;s will (11:20-26). His life was a crucified life. If a person is truly one in life with Christ, his life will be a crucified life. The life that we have received of the Lord Jesus is not a raw, unprocessed life; it is a crucified life, a life that has been processed and thoroughly dealt with. If we truly know this life, when we are insulted, we will not say anything but instead thank the Lord and even praise Him in a genuine way. The life that we should live today should be such a crucified life.</p>
<p>The one life that we share with Christ is also a resurrected life. Nothing, including death, can suppress it. If we live a resurrected life, we will not be troubled should others criticize our work. If our natural life has not been dealt with, our service in the church will not last long. If we serve in the natural life, we will be easily offended and eventually will stop serving. But if our life in serving is a life that is crucified and resurrected, nothing will be able to defeat it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the life that Christ has is a life hidden in God. Only the divine life can be hidden in God. The life that Christ has is not a showy life; it is a hidden life. If we serve by this life, we will not want to be seen by others. On the contrary, we will prefer to serve in secret. Our natural life is the opposite of this, for it is fond of making a show. Today&rsquo;s religion appeals to this element in the natural life and nourishes the natural life, but in the church the natural life is put to death. Whatever we do in the church should be done by a life hidden in God. In Matthew 6 the Lord Jesus speaks of doing things in secret, not before men (vv. 1-6, 16-18). Even in presenting our offering to the Lord, we should be hidden. In all that we do we should live a hidden life, a life hidden with Christ in God.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Seeking the Things Which Are Above</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:1 Paul says that since we were raised together with Christ, we should seek the things which are above. This verse indicates clearly that we have one position with Christ. How could we seek the things which are above if we were not above also? To seek the things above, we must be in heaven where these things are.</p>
<p>When we are in spirit, we are also in heaven, but when we are not in spirit, we are on earth and, experientially, even under the earth. Only when we are in spirit are we in heaven; whenever we are outside the spirit, we are earthly.</p>
<p>The way to seek the things which are above is to turn to the spirit and call on the name of the Lord. There is a transmission taking place from Christ in heaven to us on earth by means of the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit (Eph. 1:19, 22-23; 2:22). Our experience tells us clearly that we touch the heavens by turning to our spirit, for our spirit is the receiving end of the divine transmission, whereas the throne of God in heaven is the transmitting end. Thus, by turning to our spirit, we are lifted into heaven. Because of the transmission from the throne of God in heaven into our spirit, when we enjoy the Lord here on earth, we are simultaneously in heaven. Then in our experience we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven. Then in the spirit we are one in position with Christ, seeking the things which are above.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) Setting Their Mind on the Things Which Are Above</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:2 Paul continues, &ldquo;Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth.&rdquo; According to the New Testament, the things which are above include Christ&rsquo;s ascension, His enthronement, and His being made the Head, the Lord, and the Christ. In Acts 2:36 Peter says that God has made Jesus both Lord and Christ. In Ephesians 1:22 we see that in ascension Christ has been made Head over all things to the church. In Hebrews 2:9 we are told that the Lord Jesus has been crowned with glory and honor. In Hebrews 6:19 and 20 we see that the Lord Jesus is the Forerunner, the Pioneer, who has cut the way into glory within the veil; as our Forerunner, our Pioneer, Christ is now in glory. Such things are the things above, and we should set our mind on them.</p>
<p>Moreover, the book of Hebrews also reveals that Christ is our High Priest, the One who &ldquo;sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens&rdquo; (8:1). In Hebrews 4:14 we are told that we have &ldquo;a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.&rdquo; As our heavenly High Priest, &ldquo;He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them&rdquo; (7:25). When we call on the Lord and have fellowship with Him, we sense that something from the heavens is being transmitted into us. Often this divine transmission causes us to be beside ourselves with joy. Since we have such a High Priest interceding for us, we should &ldquo;come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help&rdquo; (4:16). The things which are above include the ministry of intercession of our High Priest. Because of His intercession, we may receive mercy and grace for our timely need.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Hebrews 8:1 and 2, Christ is also a Minister of the &ldquo;true tabernacle&rdquo; in the heavens. Christ is our heavenly Minister who is ministering in a tabernacle pitched by the Lord and not by man. This tabernacle, this sanctuary, is the third heaven, the heavenly Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies in the heavens is connected to our spirit; therefore, in experience, our regenerated spirit is also the Holy of Holies. Our spirit is thus connected to the third heaven, where Christ is ministering on our behalf. As the High Priest, He is interceding for us, and as the heavenly Minister, He is supplying us with the riches of God. In His intercession Christ brings us with our need to God. In His ministry He brings the riches of God to us.</p>
<p>In the book of Revelation we see even more of the things which are above. What we have in this book is not merely a window but an opened heaven. Heaven was opened to John, and he saw a throne set in heaven and One sitting upon the throne (4:1-2). This throne is not simply the throne of grace but the throne of authority, the throne of the divine administration. In Revelation 4:5 John goes on to say, &ldquo;Out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.&rdquo; John also tells us that in the midst of the throne he saw &ldquo;a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth&rdquo; (5:6). John&rsquo;s vision in chapters 4 and 5 of Revelation is related to God&rsquo;s administration today. From John&rsquo;s vision we realize that heaven is neither silent nor without activity. On the contrary, from His throne God is carrying out His administration over the entire universe. The Lamb, the Redeemer, the One slain on the cross for our sins, is now on the throne and has seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is executing God&rsquo;s operation in the heavens. He is the Lamb with seven eyes, with the seven Spirits of God, carrying out God&rsquo;s administration through the local churches. Actually, the churches are God&rsquo;s embassies. For this reason, the world situation is not under the control of any earthly head of state but under the churches through which God is executing His administration. Just as the American embassy in a particular country is an extension of the United States, so the churches as God&rsquo;s embassies are an extension of the heavens. Our headquarters, our administrative center, is in heaven. Therefore, we should look toward heaven, where there is a throne on which God is sitting and where the Lamb with seven eyes is standing to execute God&rsquo;s administration through the churches as His embassies. Because the churches are God&rsquo;s embassies, the enemy hates them. In Revelation 4 and 5 we have a vision of our central government, and in Revelation 1 through 3 we have a vision of the local churches as the embassies. Through the seven Spirits there is a transmission going on from the heavenly headquarters into the embassies. Through the seven Spirits, what is in the headquarters is transmitted into the churches. From the throne in the heavens, the divine transmission brings the things above into the local churches.</p>
<p>Seeing a vision of the things which are above will revolutionize our daily living. It will cause us to turn our attention from the things on earth to the things in heaven&mdash;to the glorified and enthroned Jesus, to the heavenly High Priest, to the Head over all things to the church, to the One executing the divine government. We should seek these things and set our mind on them. Then the riches of Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry will be transmitted into us, and we will be transformed and constituted of Christ.</p>
<p>The things above are related to the second of Christ&rsquo;s two ministries. The first aspect of Christ&rsquo;s ministry was His ministry on earth. Lasting thirty-three and a half years, this ministry began with Christ&rsquo;s incarnation and was concluded with His crucifixion. During the years that He was on earth, Christ accomplished much in His ministry. Through His death on the cross, He accomplished redemption for us. All Christians are familiar with the earthly ministry of Jesus and value it very highly, for it is through this ministry that we have been saved.</p>
<p>As important as Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry was, it is not the main aspect of His ministry. The primary part of His ministry is His ministry in heaven. By His earthly ministry He redeemed us, saved us, and regenerated us. But by His heavenly ministry, He is building the church (Matt. 16:18). The Body of Christ needs the heavenly ministry of Christ, the ministry of Christ above, in order to be built up.</p>
<p>To seek the things which are above and to set our mind on them are to join ourselves to the Lord in His ministry in heaven. We need to join ourselves to the One who is interceding, ministering, and executing God&rsquo;s administration. Our living should be a kind of living in which we seek these heavenly things and set our mind on them. This means that we live in such a way as to join our heavenly Christ in His priesthood, ministry, and administration. If we all live in this way, the church life will be greatly uplifted.</p>
<p>Because Christ is interceding for a particular church, we also may become burdened to pray for that church. We then ask the Lord to transmit His heavenly supply into the saints in that locality. Whenever we receive news of a need in a certain place, we should immediately pray, joining ourselves to Christ in His intercession for that need. If we do this, we will be setting our mind on the things above.</p>
<p>Our standard needs to be uplifted. We are not here to seek earthly things but to have a living that is one with Christ&rsquo;s living. Christ today is living as the High Priest, the heavenly Minister, and the universal Administrator. We need to join Him in His living and have one living with Him.</p>
<p>If we seek the things which are above and have one living with Christ, we will be wholly occupied with the enterprise of our Master. Our heart will be with Him in heaven, where He is interceding for the churches, supplying the saints, and administrating God&rsquo;s government. This will be our concern, our desire. If we take Christ as life and seek the things which are above in such a way, the lustful members will be put to death, the evil elements in the fallen soul will be put away, and the old man will be put off. Furthermore, we will automatically put on the new man.</p>
<p>To seek the things which are above and to set our mind on them are to live Christ, to have one living with Him. When Christ prays in heaven, we should pray on earth. This means that there is a transmission between the Christ praying in heaven and us praying on earth. By means of this transmission we may pray in oneness with Him. We respond on earth to Christ&rsquo;s praying in heaven. None of us should be unemployed. We all have the responsibility to respond to Christ&rsquo;s heavenly transmission. Christ is in heaven interceding, ministering, and administrating, and we are on earth responding to Christ&rsquo;s activity in heaven.</p>
<p>Between Christ in heaven and us on earth there is a divine transmission, a heavenly current. If we are receiving this transmission, we will respond to Christ&rsquo;s work in heaven. However, if in our experience we are not continuously connected to Him or if we allow insulation to build up between us and Him, the transmission will cease. It is possible that among many genuine Christians today the connection with the heavenly Christ in their experience has been severed. We may be genuine Christians, but we may not experience the divine current, and there is no fellowship between us and the Lord. Instead of being cut off from the heavenly Christ, in our experience we need to continually receive the divine transmission. Day and night, we should be infused with a supply from heaven and experience the transaction between the heavenly Christ and us. We should continually respond to Christ&rsquo;s interceding, ministering, and executing of God&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>Prayer is the only way to have our mind set on the things in heaven. When we set our mind on things above by praying, we will not pray for trivial matters. Instead our prayer will be occupied with Christ&rsquo;s heavenly intercession, ministry, and administration. Because Christ is interceding for the churches around the world, we also pray for the churches. We should let the Lord take care of all the small matters in our living. Our responsibility is to seek first the kingdom of God and God&rsquo;s righteousness (Matt. 6:33). Since the Father knows our need, He will take care of us and meet our need.</p>
<p>When we set our mind on the things which are above during our times of prayer, we become a reflection of Christ&rsquo;s ministry in the heavens. Through our prayer, Christ, the Head, is given a way to carry out His administration through His Body. When we pray, we are a heavenly ambassador on earth as the extension of God&rsquo;s kingdom. However, when we are gossiping, we are not a heavenly ambassador at all. Only when we pray do we become an ambassador of the heavenly kingdom on earth in a practical way.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s ministry in heaven is for the goal of building up the Body and forming His bride. However, Christ&rsquo;s ministry in heaven requires our response. We need to become on earth the reflection of that heavenly ministry. When we seek the things above, we respond to the Lord&rsquo;s heavenly ministry and reflect it. If in our prayer we are willing to forget insignificant matters and care for the things above, we will become conscious of the traffic between us and Christ in heaven. We will sense a current flowing back and forth between Him and us. By means of this kind of prayer, the divine riches are transfused into us. This enables us to be one with others and to be right with everyone. This also issues in the renewing of the new man. Through the heavenly transmission and transfusion, the new man comes into existence in a practical way. Hence, the new man is produced by the heavenly traffic, transaction, and transfusion.</p>
<p>As we seek the things which are above, the new man will be renewed in a full way. In a very practical sense, the new man comes into existence through our seeking of the things which are above. Therefore, if the new man is to be expressed on earth, we need to enjoy Christ as the High Priest, the heavenly Minister, and the universal administrator, experiencing the two-way traffic between the heavenly Christ and us.</p>
<p>The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is the issue of Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Galatians 3:14 indicates that Christ has redeemed us so that we may receive the Spirit. Christ accomplished redemption not merely to save us from sin, but even the more to impart Himself into us as the life-giving Spirit. When we open our being and set our mind on the things above, this Spirit transmits the riches of the divine life into us. When we set our mind on the things above, this causes the heavenly transmission to function in our experience to bring the divine essence of Christ into us. The more this essence is added into our being, the more we experience the renewing of the new man. Renewing depends on the transmission of the divine substance into us.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) To Be Manifested with Him in Glory</h2>
<p> In Colossians 3:4 Paul continues, &ldquo;When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.&rdquo; In God, Christ, not our self, our soul, is our life. This life is now hidden, but it will be manifested. Then we will be manifested with this life in glory.</p>
<p>According to Romans 8, we will one day be glorified with Christ. In Romans 8:19 we are told that the &ldquo;creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God,&rdquo; at which time it will &ldquo;be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God&rdquo; (v. 21). When we appear with our Christ in glory, even our vile body will be transfigured into a glorious body, but as we await that wonderful day, we must remain hidden with Christ in God, in the heavens, and in the church.</p>
<p>We have one glory and destiny with Christ. Glory is our future and our destination. The Lord Jesus is now in glory. However, He is in glory in a way that is hidden from mankind. People in the world do not know where Jesus is, but we know where He is&mdash;He is in glory. One day Christ will be in glory no longer in a hidden way but in an open way, in the way of manifestation. Then everyone on earth will know that the Lord Jesus is in glory. Christ&rsquo;s destiny is to be openly in glory. This is our destiny as well. We can declare, &ldquo;Glory is our destination. We are heading for glory. Our destiny is to be in glory.&rdquo; Since glory is our destination, we will eventually have one glory with Christ. It is not possible for us to describe this glory now, because we have not yet entered into it. When we are in glory with Christ, we will be beside ourselves with joy and ecstasy.</p>
<p>When we are manifested with Christ, we will be on display to the whole universe. However, today we should not make a show but should remain hidden in God, waiting for the time when we will arrive at our destination and enter into glory with Christ. Then at the appointed time, the time for a divinely-ordained display, there will be the manifestation of the sons of God in glory.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(64)</h1>
<p>In this message, we will continue to consider Christ as the life of the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(5) Putting to Death Their Members<br />
Which Are on the Earth</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:5 Paul says, &ldquo;Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greediness, which is idolatry.&rdquo; In our sinful members is the law of sin, making us captives of sin and causing our corrupted body to become the body of death (Rom. 7:23-24). Hence, our members, which are sinful, are identified with sinful things, such as fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greediness. In Colossians 3:6 Paul points out that because of these things &ldquo;the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.&rdquo; In verse 7 he goes on to say that the believers once walked in these things when they lived in them.</p>
<p>In verse 5 Paul charges us to put to death our members which are on the earth. This charge is based upon the fact that we have been crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20a) and baptized into His death (Rom. 6:3). We execute Christ&rsquo;s death upon our sinful members by crucifying them, by faith, through the power of the Spirit (8:13). This corresponds to Galatians 5:24. Christ has accomplished the all-inclusive crucifixion. Now we apply it to our lustful flesh. This is absolutely different from asceticism.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death on the cross is applied to us at the time of baptism. All those who believe in the Lord Jesus should be baptized. In baptism we not only recognize Christ&rsquo;s death but also apply it to ourselves. Therefore, in baptism we are placed into the death of Christ and are buried.</p>
<p>According to Romans 8:11 and 13, putting to death the practices the body is an action carried out in the power of the Spirit. It is not accomplished by self-effort. Our attempts to put to death the practices of the body are nothing more than asceticism. We put to death the negative things in us by the power of the Holy Spirit. In order to do this, we need to open to the Spirit and allow the Spirit to flow within us. Through the Spirit&rsquo;s flowing, we will experience the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death. This is not asceticism; it is the operation of the Spirit within us.</p>
<p>In Colossians 3:8 Paul speaks of putting away evil psychological things: &ldquo;You also, put away all these things: wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, foul abusive language out of your mouth.&rdquo; If we compare this verse with the foregoing verses, we will see that Paul classified the things of the flesh in one category and the things of the fallen soul in another category. All negative things, whether of the flesh or of the fallen soul, must be put aside. We do this not by our own energy but by the power of the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(6) Putting Off the Old Man with His Practices</h2>
<p>In verse 9 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his practices.&rdquo; This verse indicates that putting off the old man is like putting off an old garment. The total person of the old man must be put away. In this verse Paul tells us that we have put off the old man because we put off the old man in baptism. Our old man was crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6) and was buried in baptism (v. 4). First, we put to death the physical lusts, then we put away the psychological evils, and last, we put off the entire old man with his practices. This is not by our own energy but by the power of the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>When we live together with Christ, we can put off the lusts of the flesh, put away the evil aspects of the fallen soul, and put off the totality of our old being. Then, positively, we can put on the new man. By living together with Christ, by experiencing Him as our life and seeking the things which are above, we put away all the negative things and put on the new man.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(7) Putting On the New Man, Which Is Being Renewed according to the Image of Him Who Created Him</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:10 Paul continues, &ldquo;And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head6">(a) Putting On the New Man</h2>
<p>Putting on the new man is like putting on a new garment. The Greek word for <em>new</em> in this verse means new in relation to time, whereas the word used in Ephesians 4:24 means new in nature, quality, or form. Since Christ is the constituent of the new man, we, who are the new man, are one with Christ.</p>
<p>The new man is of Christ. It is His Body, created in Him on the cross (2:15-16). It is not individual but corporate. According to the clear vision in Ephesians 2:15, the new man is a corporate entity. This is proved by the fact that it is created out of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles. Furthermore, verse 16 indicates that the new man created out of these collective peoples is the Body of Christ. Hence, <em>the new man</em> and <em>the Body</em> are synonymous terms and may be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>The emphasis on the church being the Body of Christ is on life, whereas the emphasis on the church being the new man is on the person (1 Cor. 12:12; Eph. 4:4; 2:15; 4:24). As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life; as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person (Col. 3:4; Eph. 3:17a). The new man is the corporate God-man, with Christ&mdash;the firstborn Son&mdash;as the Head, and the believers&mdash;the many sons of God&mdash;as the Body. We need to live the life of a God-man for the new man as the corporate God-man.</p>
<p>In order to put on the new man in an experiential way, we need to take Christ as our person (v. 17a; Gal. 2:20). The church is the new man, and in this new man there is only one person&mdash;Christ (Matt. 17:5; Col. 3:10-11). The old man must be put off, and we must live by our new person (vv. 5-9; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 4:22-24). When we live by taking Christ as our person, especially in making decisions, our living will be the living of the new man (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38; Rom. 15:32; James 4:13-15).</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we would put on the new man in a practical way, we need to do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus (Col. 3:17). The name denotes the person, and the Lord&rsquo;s person is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17a). To do things in the name of the Lord is to act in the Spirit; this is to live Christ (Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4; Phil. 1:21).</p><h2 class="head6">(b) Being Renewed</h2>
<p>On the one hand, Paul speaks of the creation of the new man (Eph. 4:24); on the other hand, he refers to the renewing of the new man (Col. 3:10). Since the new man has already been created, why is there still the need for the new man to be renewed? How can the new man be both created and renewed? The creation of the new man took place in our spirit. When our spirit was regenerated, the new man was created. Hence, the regeneration of the spirit is actually the creation of the new man. However, as far as the soul is concerned, the new man still needs to be renewed. It is crucial that this renewing takes place especially in our mind, the leading part of the soul, as indicated by the phrase <em>unto full knowledge</em> in verse 10. Before we were regenerated, our human spirit was part of the old creation. Then at the time of our regeneration, God the Spirit came into our spirit with the divine life and divine nature. This means that the Spirit of God regenerated our spirit with the elements of the divine life and divine nature. In other words, when we were regenerated, God the Spirit brought the divine life and nature into our spirit. Before regeneration we did not have anything divine. But at the time of regeneration something divine&mdash;the life and nature of God&mdash;was added into our spirit. This addition of the Spirit and the divine life to our spirit produced a new being&mdash;the new man. By receiving the life and nature of God, we were born of God and became sons of God.</p>
<p>Because the divine life and nature have been added to our spirit, our regenerated spirit has become part of the new creation. The difference between the old creation and the new creation is that the old creation has nothing of God in it, but the new creation does have something of God added to it. The reason the regenerated spirit is part of the new creation and of the new man is that the life and nature of God have come into it. In our spirit we have something divine&mdash;God&rsquo;s life and nature.</p>
<p>At the time of regeneration the life and nature of God were added into our spirit, making it the new creation. Nevertheless, the soul with its faculties of mind, emotion, and will remains in the old creation. Thus, there is the need for the divine life and nature to spread from our spirit into our soul and to saturate the soul. This process of spreading and saturating is what we call transformation. In Romans 12:2 Paul charges us to &ldquo;be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; Since the mind is the leading part of the soul, the renewing of the soul depends on the renewing of the mind. As the divine life and nature spread from our regenerated spirit into the mind, emotion, and will, our soul will be renewed. This renewing of the soul is actually the renewing of the new man.</p>
<p>Even though we have been regenerated, we are often inclined to live according to the old man, that is, to live according to the old creation. However, deep in our spirit we have the aspiration, the desire, to live in newness of life (6:4; 7:6). This desire comes from the new man in our spirit, seeking to spread the divine life and nature into our soul. This spreading is the renewing of the new man.</p>
<p>What we think about day by day indicates where our mind is set. Our mind should be set not on religion, philosophy, or culture but on Christ and His heavenly ministry. The more we set our mind on the things above&mdash;on Christ and His heavenly ministry&mdash;the more the divine elements in our spirit will saturate our soul and renew our soul. All that is in our spirit will have free course to spread throughout our inner being. Through this saturating and spreading, the soul is renewed. Eventually, when our body is transfigured, it also will be renewed (Phil. 3:21). Therefore, our spirit has been regenerated, but our soul is being renewed. On the one hand, in our spirit the new man was created with new elements, the elements of the divine life and the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, in our soul the new man is being renewed.</p>
<h2 class="head6">&#169;) Unto Full Knowledge according to the Image of God<br />
Who Created the New Man</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:10 Paul says that the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge &ldquo;according to the image of Him who created him.&rdquo; The image here refers to Christ, God&rsquo;s Beloved, as the expression of God (1:15; Heb. 1:3). It was God the Creator who created the new man in Christ (Eph. 2:15).</p>
<p>It is significant that the new man is being renewed according to the image of God. This means that the renewing of the new man results in full knowledge and that this full knowledge is according to the image of God. The image of God in Colossians 1:15 refers to the expression of God and the fullness of God, that is, Christ Himself.</p>
<p>The new man has been created in our spirit, but our mind has not yet been renewed unto full knowledge. We need to be renewed in our mind unto full knowledge according to the expression of God, that is, according to Christ as God&rsquo;s image. This means that we need a renewal in our mind according to what Christ is. This can take place only as we are renewed unto full knowledge.</p>
<p>Concerning the new man, our mind needs to be renewed unto such a full knowledge, according to the all-inclusive Christ who is the image of God, the expression of the invisible God. Our mind needs to be renewed to such an extent that we have a clear view of Christ as the image of God. When our mind is filled with the knowledge of the all-inclusive Christ, our emotion will be influenced. This will cause us to have a greater appreciation of the Lord Jesus. Love is a matter of the emotion, and the emotion is related to the understanding that we have in the mind. When the mind is renewed, the emotion is spontaneously renewed as well. Both in spiritual experience and in human experience, the mind affects the emotion, and the emotion affects the will.</p>
<p>We need to be renewed in our mind in order to have a proper love for the Lord in our emotion. Many saints are cold toward the Lord because in their minds they do not have much knowledge of Him. The more we have the knowledge of the all-inclusive Christ, the more we will appreciate Him and love Him. Although we still need a great deal more renewing, we nevertheless have a certain amount of knowledge of the Lord Jesus. This knowledge of Him causes us to love Him. Out of our love and appreciation for the Lord, we exercise our will to decide to be for Him, to follow Him, and to live Him, grow Him, and produce Him. We decide to live for Him and for His testimony. This decision comes out of the emotion, and the emotion is in turn influenced by the proper knowledge of Christ.</p>
<p>The central point of Paul&rsquo;s word to the Colossians concerns the renewing of the mind unto the full knowledge of Christ. The Colossians needed a full knowledge, not according to philosophy, Gnosticism, Judaistic observances, or heathen ordinances but a full knowledge according to the image of God, which image is the wonderful, glorious, all-inclusive Christ. We need a renewing that results in full knowledge according to such a Christ.</p>
<p>We need to be captured by the dear Lord Jesus. The more our mind is renewed unto the proper knowledge of Him, the more we love Him. The renewing that takes place in our mind unto full knowledge according to the image of God creates appreciation within us for the Lord. This appreciation causes us to love Him. When we have such a love for the Lord, we will say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I want to follow You at any cost. I am willing to pay any price, even the price of my life, to be one with You and be for You. Lord, I want to take You as my life and as my person. I want to live You, grow You, and produce You. Lord Jesus, I am here for You and for You alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The renewing of the new man is according to Christ, who is the image and expression of God. When we set our mind on the things above, the way is open for the new man to spread the divine element from our spirit into our soul. This spreading of the divine element within us is according to Christ, who is the image of God, God&rsquo;s expression. The more renewing that takes place in our soul, the more we will be able to express God. In other words, the more renewing we experience in the soul, the more we will have of the image of Christ. Although we have been regenerated, we may have very little of the image of Christ in our mind, emotion, and will. Instead, we may cling to the image of the old Adam. But if we set our mind on the things above, the divine element in our spirit will spread into our soul. As a result of the spreading of the divine element, we will have the image of God and become His expression.</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Constituents of the New Man</h2>
<p>In 3:11 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; The word <em>where,</em> which refers to the new man in verse 10, means in the new man. Not only is there no natural person in the new man, but there is no possibility, no room, for any natural person to exist. There cannot be Greeks, who were for philosophical wisdom, and Jews, who were for miraculous signs (1 Cor. 1:22). There cannot be circumcision&mdash;the observers of the Jewish religious rituals&mdash;and uncircumcision&mdash;those who do not care for the Jewish religion. Furthermore, in the new man there cannot be barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free man. A barbarian is an uncultured person, the Scythians were considered the most barbarous people, the slaves were those sold into slavery, and the free men were those who had been freed from slavery. No matter what kind of person we may be, as far as the new man is concerned, we must regard ourselves as nobodies. In the new man there is room only for Christ, not for any kind of natural person. Therefore, in the church we all are nobodies.</p>
<p>In the new man Christ is all. In the church as the new man, Christ is everything. This implies that He is every brother and every sister. This also implies that every brother and sister must be constituted with Christ. In the new man there cannot be Jewish members and Gentile members; there can only be Christ-members. If we would be constituted with Christ, Christ must be added into us more and more. We must be permeated with Christ, saturated with Christ, and have Christ organically wrought into our being. Eventually, we will be replaced by Christ. Then, in reality, He will be all and in all. He will be every member, every part, of the new man.</p>
<p>The new man does not come into existence by taking Christians from various countries and bringing them together. That would be a new organization, not the new man. The new man comes into being as we are saturated, filled, and permeated with Christ and replaced by Him through an organic process. The new man is Christ in all the saints permeating us and replacing us until all natural distinctions have been eliminated, and everyone is constituted with Christ.</p>
<p>In Colossians Paul presents the Christ who is the fullness of the invisible God. After mentioning aspect after aspect of such a Christ, he speaks of the new man. Between Christ as the fullness of God in chapter 1 and the new man in chapter 3 we have the experience and enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ. The issue of our experience and enjoyment of Him is the church as the new man. Hence, the new man comes out of our enjoyment of Christ as the fullness of God. As we enjoy Christ daily, He is wrought into us, constituted into our being. In this way Christ becomes our constituent. Day by day Christ is being constituted into us. Eventually, we all will be thoroughly constituted of Him. As a result of being constituted with Christ, we become the new man.</p>
<p>The only way Christ can be all and in all in the new man is for Him to constitute Himself into us. The process of being constituted with Christ takes place through our enjoyment of Christ. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You, I treasure You, and I enjoy You. Lord, I am here on earth for You and for You alone.&rdquo; The more we open to the Lord and contact Him in this way, the more He infuses Himself into us and fills us to the brim. As we call on the Lord, praise Him, and offer Him our thanks and adoration, we are filled with Him. Through such an enjoyment of Christ and experience of Him, we are gradually constituted with Christ. It is as we enjoy Him that He constitutes us with Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Being All the Members</h2>
<p>In the new man Christ is all; He is all the members of the new man. He is everything in the new man. Actually, He is the new man, His Body (1 Cor. 12:12-13). In the new man Christ is the centrality and universality.</p>
<p>The word <em>all</em> in Colossians 3:11 refers to all the members who make up the new man. Christ is all these members. Since Christ is all and in all in the new man and we are part of the new man, we are part of Christ. Each member, each part, of the new man is Christ. He is everyone in the new man. In the church, the new man, there is nothing but Christ.</p>
<p>In the one new man there is room only for Christ. We may wonder how Christ can be all in the new man. For this to be a reality, we must take Christ as our life and live Him, not ourselves. If Christ is the living of all the saints, then only He will be in the new man. Those from America will no longer live an American life, and those from Japan will no longer live a Japanese life. All the saints, whatever their nationality may be, will live Christ. Then in a way that is real and practical, Christ will be all the members of the new man. Christ will be us. Because we all live Christ, not ourselves, Christ will be all of us, every member of the new man.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Being in All the Members</h2>
<p>In verse 11 Paul says not only that Christ is all but also that He is in all. In other words, on the one hand, Christ is all the members, and on the other hand, He is in all the members. Since Paul says that Christ is all, why is there the need for him to say that Christ is in all? If Paul did not say that Christ is in all, only that He is all, then we may think that in the new man Christ is needed and that we are not needed. We should not think that because Christ is all the members in the new man, we are nothing and are not needed. On the one hand, the Bible does say that in the new man there is no place for the natural person, because Christ is all the members. Yet on the other hand, Paul says that Christ is in the members. The fact that Christ is in the members of the new man indicates that the members still exist.</p>
<p>When we take Christ as our life and live together with Him, seeking the things which are above, we have the sense deep within that we are one with Christ and that Christ is us (Gal. 2:20). But simultaneously we have an even deeper sense that Christ is in us. Therefore, it is true to say that Christ is both in us and that He is us. We are part of the new man with Christ in us. We continue to exist, but we do not exist without Christ; we are those indwelt by Christ. Now we can rejoice and say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, when I take You as my life and live together with You, You are me. I am altogether one with You. But, Lord, I am still here, for You are in me. I am here, but I am here with You.&rdquo; According to our experience, we all can give such a testimony. When we live Christ and are one with Him, we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, this is not me&mdash;it is You.&rdquo; However, at the same time, we have the sense that we are with the Lord and that He is in us.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s ultimate goal in His economy is to gain this new man constituted with the preeminent, all-inclusive Christ wrought into a corporate people. The new man is Christ constituted into us. On the one hand, the new man is Christ. On the other hand, we the believers are the new man. For this reason, in the new man Christ and we are one. We all need to have such a high view of God&rsquo;s economy. According to this view, we and Christ are one, for we and He have one life with one living.</p>
<p>In Colossians 3:10 and 11 we see that in the new man Christ is all and in all. Christ is all the members and in all the members. In the new man there is no room for any natural person. Rather, Christ is everyone and is in everyone. To say that Christ is all and in all in the new man indicates that we are one with Christ and that Christ is one with us. We may even say that Christ is us and that we are Him. This points to our union with Christ. Therefore, the living of the saints must be a living that is in union with Christ, a living that is identified with Him. If we live in such a way, we and Christ, Christ and we, are one. We live, and Christ lives in our living.</p>
<p>In such a union we and Christ, Christ and we, are one. In a very practical sense, Christ is us and we are Christ, for we live as one. His life is our life, and our living is His living. Therefore, Christ lives in our living. This is the normal Christian living, the living that is up to God&rsquo;s standard and that fulfills the requirements of His economy.</p>
<p>In the new man Christ is everyone, and He is also in everyone. This is to experience Christ not only as the reality of our daily necessities but to have Him as our life and to be one with Him in the divine enterprise. When we are one with Him in this way, He becomes us, and we live with Him in us. We live not alone but with Christ in us. Day by day we should have more experience of this&mdash;taking Christ as our life, living together with Him, seeking the things which are above, and coordinating with Him for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Then we will all be able to say that to us to live is Christ and that Christ lives in us (Phil. 1:21; Gal. 2:20). Because Christ is the unique constituent of the new man, there should be no differences among the believers who are part of this new man. In the new man, all the room is for Christ. Christ is all and in all. This means that Christ is every part of the new man and is in every part. The goal of this extensive revelation of Christ is that we would all live Christ.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the renewing of the new man, Christ is all things, and He is in all the members. This indicates that in the renewing of the new man, Christ truly is all-inclusive. On the one hand, He is in all the persons, the members of the new man; on the other hand, He is all things in the renewing of the new man, including all virtues and attributes such as love, patience, and humility (Col. 3:12-14). All these virtues are Christ Himself. In the renewing of the new man, Christ is all the wonderful virtues, all the good things, and all the positive attributes.</p>
<p>If we would live Christ as the constituent of the new man, we need to be ruled by the peace of Christ (vv. 12-15) and inhabited by the word of Christ (vv. 16-17). The peace of Christ must arbitrate within our being, and the word of Christ must dwell in us richly. As Christians, we have different backgrounds and different concepts. These differences lead to disagreements among us; therefore, there is the need for an arbitrator. This arbitrator is the peace of Christ. It is crucial that the peace of Christ be allowed to preside in our hearts and to speak the final word regarding any controversy among us. The arbitrator should not be our opinions, concepts, choices, or preferences; it should be the peace of Christ, to which we are called in one Body.</p>
<p>The peace of Christ is the peace to which Paul refers in Ephesians 2:15, where we are told that Christ abolished &ldquo;in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace.&rdquo; This peace is the oneness of the new man, the Body. By abolishing the ordinances, Christ has created the different peoples into one new man. Now within us as members of the new man there is something which Paul terms the peace of Christ. Hence, the peace of Christ is the oneness of the new man composed of different peoples. Apart from the work of Christ on the cross, there can be no oneness among the different peoples. But through His death Christ has made peace; that is, He has produced oneness. This oneness of the new man is now within us. This oneness, the peace of Christ, must now be permitted to arbitrate in our hearts. It should function as a referee to settle the disputes among various parties. We need to set aside our opinion, our concept, and listen to the word of the indwelling referee. There is no need for us to quarrel or to express our opinion. We should simply let the peace of Christ make the final decision.</p>
<p>As those who are part of the new man, we should not only let the peace of Christ arbitrate within us but also let the word of Christ inhabit us, dwell in us, make home in us. We must be willing to set aside our concepts, our opinions, and give place to the word of Christ. If we want the word of Christ to inhabit us, we need to empty our entire inner being. All our inward parts&mdash;our mind, emotion, will, heart, and spirit&mdash;must be empty, available to be filled with the word of Christ. This word should not only dwell in us; it should also inhabit us, making its home in every part of our inner being. May every room and corner of our being be inhabited by the word of Christ! If we would live Christ as the constituent of the new man, the peace of Christ must be the arbitrator in our heart, and the word of Christ must be the content of our inner being. We all need to give place to the arbitrating peace of Christ and to the inhabiting word of Christ.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to persevere in prayer (Col. 4:2). When we enter into genuine prayer, we are far away from our culture, for we are one with the living Lord. When we pray in this way with others, we are truly one in the praying spirit. Then we touch the reality of the one new man, where there is no Greek or Jew, barbarian or Scythian, circumcision or uncircumcision. We realize that the new man is constituted with Christ alone and that in this realm there are no differences of culture. However, when we stop praying, we come back to our natural life with its opinions and striving.</p>
<p>In 3:3 and 4 we see that the Christ who is the focal point of God&rsquo;s economy and the reality of all the positive things is our life. Our life is hidden with Christ in God. This means that we today are living in God. As our life, Christ is the constituent of the new man. In the new man the Christ who is our life is all and in all.</p>
<p>The desire of God&rsquo;s heart is to have the new man. This was His plan in eternity past, and this was the reason He created the universe and accomplished redemption for us in Christ. Our preaching of the gospel and our being the new creation are likewise for the new man. The time has come for God to have the new man expressed on earth. If we take Christ as our life and live together with Him, the new man will come forth to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>When we enjoy Christ as the reality of all positive things, we become Body-conscious. This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ issues in the Body of Christ. Then as we go on to experience Christ as our life and to have one living, destiny, and glory with Him, the issue is not just the church as the Body of Christ but the church as the one new man.</p>
<p>In 1:9&mdash;3:11 we see seven major aspects of Christ: Christ is the portion of the saints (1:9-14), He is the first both in creation and in resurrection (1:15-23), He is the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy (1:24-29), He is the mystery of God (2:1-7), He is the body of all the shadows (2:8-23), He is the life of the saints (3:1-4), and He is the constituent of the new man (3:5-11). These aspects of Christ are presented in a marvelous sequence. First we see that Christ is the portion of the saints and last that He is the constituent of the new man. This indicates that the ultimate issue of enjoying Christ as our portion is that we experience Him as the content and constituent of the new man. Whenever we enjoy Christ, there is a definite result, an issue, of this enjoyment. To say that the enjoyment of Christ as the portion of the saints results in the experience of Christ as the constituent of the new man indicates that the enjoyment of Christ results in the church life. Christ is the all-inclusive portion of the saints, typified by the good land. If we enjoy Christ as such a portion, the result will be the new man with Christ as the content. Ultimately, the Christ we enjoy as our portion becomes the constituent of the new man. In this new man Christ is all and in all. Hence, it is crucial for us to learn to live Christ as the constituent of the new man.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(65)</h1>
<p>In the Epistles of 1 Thessalonians through Philemon, we see the experience and enjoyment of Christ in many practical points concerning our Christian walk.</p>
<h2 class="head3">83. The Hope of the Church&mdash;<br />
Christ in His Coming</h2>
<p>In 1 and 2 Thessalonians Christ in His coming is revealed as the hope of the church. The two Epistles to the Thessalonians were written in the light of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. In particular, every chapter of 1 Thessalonians ends with the coming of the Lord. This shows that the writer, Paul, lived and worked with the Lord&rsquo;s coming before him, taking it as an attraction, an incentive, a goal, and a warning (1:10; 2:19; 3:13; 4:15-18; 5:23). Those who do not believe in Christ have no hope, but we the believers have a hope with numerous aspects. One aspect of our hope, which we may call the hope of the church, is the coming Christ, that is, Christ in His coming. Christ is the Husband of the church. Without Christ&rsquo;s visible presence, the church is like a widow, a woman who is without her husband. Hence, our unique hope is the coming back of our Husband to the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Cause of Our Endurance</h2>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 1:3 Paul speaks of &ldquo;endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The hope of Christ&rsquo;s coming is the cause of our endurance. This endurance comes from the hope in the Lord&rsquo;s coming, or from the hope in the coming Lord. While we live on the earth as believers and witnesses of Christ, we experience suffering, for which we need endurance. In the church life as well as in the family we all need endurance. We must be trained and educated&mdash;first to work, then to labor, and eventually to endure. In the work of shepherding others, endurance is crucial. If we would be successful in shepherding the saints, we must exercise endurance. Endurance involves suffering, not enjoyment. Shepherding always involves an amount of suffering. We all need an incentive that encourages us to endure the suffering. Hence, we should have the hope of the coming of Christ as the cause of our endurance.</p>
<p>Endurance is a real strength to us. If we have endurance, we can do everything. Endurance comes from the hope of glory (Col. 1:27). We have the hope that we will see Him, that one day He will come, and that one day He and we will be in glory (3:4). We have the hope of seeing Him and meeting Him. Often we cannot and would not do certain things, and we determine to not be defeated, simply because we realize that we will see the Lord. We must stand and fight the battle to the end because one day, perhaps tomorrow, we will meet Him. This is our hope. By such hope we have endurance. This endurance is the power and strength for us to suffer, labor, press on, live for Him, and sacrifice everything for Him. Strength is in endurance, and endurance is in hope.</p>
<p>Our hope is in the coming Christ with His glory; the endurance of this hope brings about the long life of our work of faith. Through such an endurance we can subdue all kinds of disappointments, discouragements, and impossibilities; we can also overcome all kinds of oppositions, obstacles, and frustrations (Heb. 4:16; Phil. 2:13; 4:11-13; 2 Thes. 3:5). Such an endurance consummates in gaining sinners, feeding the believers, perfecting the saints, and building up the church, the Body of Christ, for the kingdom of God and of Christ (2 Cor. 6:4; 1 Cor. 15:58). We should be persons who endure in hope of the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>The endurance of hope in 1 Thessalonians 1:3 corresponds to the waiting for the Son of God in verse 10. If we have the endurance of hope, we will wait for God&rsquo;s Son from the heavens. With the endurance of hope, we wait for the coming back of the Son of God.</p>
<p>An important characteristic of our Christian life is that we are waiting for God&rsquo;s Son from the heavens. As Christians, we must live a life that declares to others that our hope is not on this earth or in this age. Instead, our hope is in the coming Lord, and our future is in Him. On this earth we do not have any destiny, destination, or future. Our future, our destiny, and our destination are altogether focused on the Lord who is coming. He will be our hope, our future, and our destination. We are going to the Lord, and our destiny is to meet Him. As believers in Christ, we declare that we are waiting for the coming of the Son of God from the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Our Expectation&mdash;the One Who Delivers Us<br />
from the Wrath Which Is Coming</h2>
<p>Christ in His coming is also our expectation, the One who delivers us from the wrath which is coming. In verse 10 Paul says that believers in Thessalonica &ldquo;await His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.&rdquo; While unbelievers await the wrath which they will suffer, we the believers await Christ as the One who delivers us from the wrath which is coming, the wrath of the coming judgment of God (Rom. 2:5-9).</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Incentive of Our Work for Him&mdash;<br />
to Have Hope, Joy, a Crown, and Glory</h2>
<p>The coming of Christ is our incentive to work for Him by fostering the believers unto maturity so that they may be our hope, joy, crown, and glory at His coming. In 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20, Paul says to the believers in Thessalonica, &ldquo;What is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at His coming? Are not even you? For you are our glory and joy.&rdquo; These verses indicate that since the apostles were the believers&rsquo; nursing mother and exhorting father (vv. 7, 11), the believers, as the apostles&rsquo; children, were their glory and joy. If we work faithfully for Christ, at His coming He will reward us with joy, a crown, and glory.</p>
<p>In verses 19 and 20 Paul indicates that those who work with the Lord in fostering the believers to walk worthily of God will receive a reward. This reward will be the believers whom we have fostered becoming our crown, glory, and joy. What a glory it would be to any Christian worker for the ones whom he has fostered to be matured at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back! What a crown and joy this would be to him! But on the contrary, what a shame it would be if none of the believers had grown and matured.</p>
<p>The result of our work with young saints should be their maturing. If they mature properly, they will be in the kingdom participating in God&rsquo;s glory. This maturity will then become our crown, joy, and boast before the Lord Jesus at His coming. Those who have been edified, supplied, shepherded, and led by us will be our crown, joy, and boast before the Lord. Suppose, however, that we work continually with new believers but to no avail. If this is the situation, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back there will be no result of our work. What a shame that would be! When the Lord Jesus comes, the result of our work will be manifested. We need to learn how to work with the young ones and the new ones so that they may be fostered to grow unto maturity and so that there may be a positive result of our work before the Lord at His coming. This result will then be our crown and glory as the reward of our work today.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Cause of Our Blamelessness in Holiness<br />
before Our God and Father</h2>
<p>The coming Christ is also the cause of our blamelessness in holiness before our God and Father. 1 Thessalonians 3:13 says, &ldquo;He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.&rdquo; The phrase <em>blameless in holiness</em> means that no fault is found in our holiness. The subject of 1 Thessalonians is a holy life for the church life&mdash;serving the living God, conducting ourselves in a holy manner, and waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. The subject of 2 Thessalonians is encouragement and correction concerning the holy life for the church life. Striking points in these Epistles are holiness and sanctification.</p>
<p>The establishing of the believers&rsquo; hearts blameless issues from faith and love. This spontaneously produces the hope of the coming back of our dear Lord, in whom we believe and whom we love. Inwardly, our heart must be established in holiness; outwardly, our body must be preserved in sanctification (1 Thes. 4:4; 5:23). This is so that we may have a holy life, and this holy life is for the church life.</p>
<p>The establishing of our heart is the result of the perfecting of our faith and of the increase and abounding of our love (3:6, 10, 12). For our hearts to be established blameless in holiness involves dispositional sanctification, not merely positional separation or sinless perfection. This indicates that the Lord is doing a work of building in us. This building work is to establish our heart. Our heart needs to be built up, to be established blameless.</p>
<p>Second Thessalonians 2:13 says, &ldquo;We ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.&rdquo; This verse speaks of salvation in sanctification, and 1 Thessalonians 3:13, of being blameless in holiness. To be in holiness is different from being in sanctification. Of course, holiness and sanctification both refer to an element that is holy. However, holiness refers to the element itself, and sanctification refers to the process of being made holy, the process of being sanctified. A process is going on to make us holy; this process is sanctification. Therefore, to be in holiness is to be in the element, and to be in sanctification is to be in the process of being made holy.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation is in sanctification. This means that God&rsquo;s salvation involves a continuing process through which we are being made holy. As this process is taking place, we enjoy God&rsquo;s saving power. Holiness is the element of God&rsquo;s holy nature. It is in this element that we are to be blameless. For our heart to be established blameless in holiness, it needs the element of holiness added to it. We need to be blameless in the element of holiness, and we also need to undergo the process of sanctification so that we may enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation daily and even hourly.</p>
<p>Our heart is blamable, worthy of blame, because it is changeable; an unchanging heart is a blameless heart (Psa. 57:7; 108:1; 112:7). God is the unchanging One, but according to our natural birth our heart is changeable, both in our relationship with others and with the Lord (cf. 2 Tim. 4:10; Matt. 13:3-9, 18-23). There is no one who, according to his natural, human life, is steadfast in his heart; because our heart changes so easily, it is not at all trustworthy (Jer. 17:9-10; 13:23). In God&rsquo;s salvation the renewing of the heart is once for all, but in our experience our heart is renewed continually, because it is changeable (Ezek. 36:26; 2 Cor. 4:16). Because our heart is changeable, it needs to be renewed continually by the sanctifying Spirit so that our heart can be established and built up in the state of being holy, separated unto God, occupied by God, possessed by God, and saturated with God (Titus 3:5; Rom. 6:19, 22). If our heart is set, built up, and established upon a solid foundation, it will then become blameless. An unchanging heart is a blameless heart.</p>
<p>We need to realize and admit that our heart is changeable. Therefore, we need to receive mercy and grace from the Lord that we may give Him the permission to establish our heart. He is waiting for our permission before He works within us to do the establishing. When our heart has been established, it will become blameless.</p>
<p>When we were away from the Lord, our heart also was turned away from Him. Instead of being occupied by the Lord, our heart was occupied by many other things. Furthermore, our heart certainly was not saturated with the Lord. However, we can praise the Lord that through His mercy and grace, we are now on the way to being separated fully unto the Lord, to being occupied wholly by Him, and to being saturated thoroughly with Him. When this process has been completed, our heart will be in the state of being holy, in the state of holiness.</p>
<p>For our heart to be established blameless in holiness includes much more than simply for our heart to turn to the Lord and to be pure toward the Lord (2 Cor. 3:16; Matt. 5:8). This is to have our turned and pure heart separated unto the Lord, occupied by the Lord, and saturated with the Lord. Such a heart not only has turned to the Lord, but it also has a pure motive. It is separated unto Him, fully occupied by Him, and thoroughly saturated with Him. It is here in such a state that our heart will be established. Once our heart has been established, it will be set, and it will no longer be movable or changeable. Furthermore, when our heart is in such a condition, it will become blameless.</p>
<p>To be blameless is not the same as to be perfect. When something is perfect, it is without blemish or defect. This goes beyond blamelessness. In other words, to be without blame is not as good as to be without blemish. In 1 Thessalonians 3:13 Paul does not require perfection. Rather, he requires only that our heart be blameless. The way for our heart to be blameless is for it to be established by the Lord. If our heart is established by Him, we will be those whose hearts have been separated unto the Lord, occupied by Him, and saturated with Him. Then our heart will be set, established, and built up in holiness. Here, in this state of holiness, the state of being made holy, our heart will become blameless.</p>
<p>We all need to look to the Lord to have mercy on us. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me. I want to have my mind renewed. I want to have my emotion filled with Your love. I want to have a will that is truly one with Your will.&rdquo; If we have such a heart, then the heart will be established blameless in holiness, blameless in the state of being made holy.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(66)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider our experience and enjoyment of Christ in His coming as the hope of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Our Comfort concerning the Dead in Him</h2>
<p>The hope of Christ&rsquo;s coming is our comfort concerning the dead in Him. According to 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, the hope of Christ&rsquo;s coming comforts us concerning the dead in Christ, in order that we would not sorrow or lose heart but instead believe that all the dead ones will be raised up to meet the Lord with us in the air on the day of His coming.</p>
<p>In verses 13 through 18, Paul gives an elementary word concerning the Lord&rsquo;s coming as a comfort and encouragement in the death of the believers. What Paul describes in this passage is the general hope of all believers. This is the hope of a holy life for the church life. Because of man&rsquo;s fall there is no hope for the fallen human race. The only expectation that unbelievers have is death. Death is their destination. Day by day they are living with a view toward their death, and they are on the way to death. Thus, death is their future. In Ephesians 2:12 Paul describes the hopeless situation of unbelievers: &ldquo;You were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.&rdquo; Unbelievers have no hope because they do not have God. Because they are apart from Christ and their living is without God, they do not have any hope. The only thing that awaits them is death. For this reason, unbelievers do not like to think about their future. Actually, they do not have a positive future. In their future looms the darkness of death.</p>
<p>To the believers, however, Paul presents in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 a basic concept of the hope of our Christian life. He wants to impress us with the fact that the Christian life, which is a holy life for the church life, has a hope. Therefore, this life is absolutely different from the hopeless life of fallen mankind. The hope of the Christian life is the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, and this hope includes resurrection.</p>
<p>In verse 13 Paul says, &ldquo;We do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are sleeping, that you would not grieve even as also the rest who have no hope.&rdquo; The words <em>those who are sleeping</em> refer to the dead (v. 16; John 11:11-14; 1 Cor. 11:30). The death of believers is considered by both the Lord and the apostle as sleep. Perhaps by the time Paul wrote this Epistle, some of the believers in Thessalonica had died. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for Paul to write about this matter.</p>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 4:14 Paul continues, &ldquo;If we believe that Jesus died and rose, so also those who have fallen asleep through Jesus, God will bring with Him.&rdquo; To believe in the hope described here includes believing in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. Anyone who does not believe in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection will not believe in this hope. But if we believe in this hope, this indicates that we have already believed in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>Verses 15 and 16 say, &ldquo;For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep; because the Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.&rdquo; We need to pay careful attention to the word <em>rise</em> in verse 16. If the dead are already in heaven, what need is there for them to rise? If they are truly in heaven, they do not need to rise. Furthermore, they do not need to be raptured or to be caught up to the Lord. Their only need would be to descend from heaven with the Lord Jesus. The fact that verse 16 says that the dead in Christ will rise indicates that they must be in some place other than heaven.</p>
<p>In verse 15 the Greek word translated &ldquo;coming&rdquo; is <em>parousia,</em> or &ldquo;presence.&rdquo; In verse 16 the Greek words rendered &ldquo;shout of command&rdquo; implies a signal for assembling. The trumpet of God is the last trumpet (1 Cor. 15:52), a trumpet for assembling God&rsquo;s redeemed people (cf. Num. 10:2).</p>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 4:17 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord.&rdquo; According to this verse, both the dead and the living believers will be caught up to the Lord. First the dead will be raised, and then the living believers will be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air.</p>
<p>In Revelation 12 the man-child, that is, the overcomers, is caught up, raptured, to the throne of God in the third heaven before the great tribulation, the last three and a half years of the present age (vv. 5-6, 14). In 1 Thessalonians 4:17 the majority of the believers, including those who are resurrected from the dead and those who are living at that time, are raptured to the air at the end of the great tribulation, at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming (parousia).</p>
<p>According to the Bible, in Hades, there are two sections: a section of comfort and a section of torment. The dead believers are in the comfortable section of Hades (Luke 16:22, 25-26), Paradise (23:43). Dead unbelievers are in the section of torment. The section of torment and suffering is different from the lake of fire. The unpleasant part of Hades may be compared to a jail in contrast to a prison. A jail is a place where criminals are held temporarily. But after a criminal has been tried and judged, he is taken from jail and put into prison. The sinners now in the section of torment in Hades are awaiting the final judgment, which will take place at the white throne of God (Rev. 20:11). After that, the sinners will be cast into the lake of fire, the eternal prison.</p>
<p>The dead saints are in Paradise, and when the Lord Jesus comes, they will rise up. However, they will not rise up to heaven; rather, they will rise up, and then the living saints will be caught up together with them in the clouds. This is the reason 1 Thessalonians 4:16 says that the dead in Christ will rise first. Then, according to verse 17, those who are living will be caught up at the same time with the dead believers to meet the Lord in the air.</p>
<p>According to the Word of God, when the Lord Jesus descends from heaven, the dead saints will rise up. Their spirit and soul will rise out of Paradise, their body will rise up from the tomb, and their spirit and soul with their body will make them perfect. They will then join the believers who are living, and together we will all be caught up to the Lord.</p>
<p>As Christians, we should live a holy life for the church life. This life has a hope, the hope that the Lord whom we are serving today will come back. At His coming back, the saints who have died will rise up from Paradise and the tomb to be caught up with those who are alive and remain.</p><h2 class="head4">f. The Cause of Our Watchfulness</h2>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 5:1-11 Paul indicates that the coming Christ is the cause of our watchfulness. We have a wonderful hope, a hope that the Lord Jesus will come back and that we will be raptured to Him. Along with this hope, we need to be watchful and sober. We should not be asleep, and we should not be drunk or in some kind of stupor.</p>
<p>In verses 1 through 3 Paul indicates that the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need for anything to be written to you.&rdquo; Times and seasons here refer to the times and the seasons with regard to the Lord&rsquo;s coming. This is confirmed by the expression <em>the day of the Lord</em> in verse 2.</p>
<p>In verse 2 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For you yourselves know perfectly well that like a thief in the night, so the day of the Lord comes.&rdquo; The coming of the Lord in chapter 4 is mainly for comfort and encouragement. The day of the Lord in chapter 5 is mainly for warning (vv. 3-6), since it is mentioned in the Word mostly in relation to the Lord&rsquo;s judgment (1 Cor. 1:8; 3:13; 5:5; 2 Cor. 1:14; 2 Tim. 4:8).</p>
<p>The fact that the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night indicates that its coming is kept secret and that it will come suddenly. It is not known beforehand by anyone (Matt. 24:42-43; Rev. 3:3; 16:15). This thought is strengthened by what Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 5:3: &ldquo;When they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, just as birth pangs to a woman with child; and they shall by no means escape.&rdquo; The coming destruction in this verse is related to the salvation mentioned in verses 8 and 9. Salvation in these verses is salvation from the coming destruction through the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, not salvation from eternal perdition through the Lord&rsquo;s death. Fallen man will perish for eternity&mdash;that is, eternal perdition. We who have believed in the Lord Jesus will be saved from eternal perdition. We have already obtained salvation in this respect. We have been saved from eternal perdition, and we will never perish.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the light of Romans 8:21-25, we will also be saved from the slavery of corruption of the old creation. All created things today are subject to the slavery of corruption. The entire old creation is enslaved to corruption. Everything, including our physical body, is decaying. To grow old is to decay. We all are in the process of decaying (2 Cor. 4:16). The slavery of corruption in the old creation is controlling us, and we are subject to it. But when the Lord Jesus comes and we are raptured, we will be saved from the slavery of corruption of the old creation. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s coming and our rapture will save us from two things: destruction and the slavery of corruption. This is the salvation mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 5:8-9, with the primary emphasis being the salvation from the coming destruction.</p>
<p>What is this coming destruction? This destruction is related to the battle that is raging between God and Satan. Near the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming, destruction will take place suddenly. That destruction will come primarily from God, but a portion of it will be caused by Satan. God will judge this rebellious world, and Satan will fight back. The result of the intense battle raging between God and Satan will be sudden destruction. It will be when people say, &ldquo;Peace and security,&rdquo; that this destruction will come suddenly.</p>
<p>We need to be saved from this sudden destruction. The way to be saved from it is to be watchful and sober. As God is fighting, we must take sides with Him and fight for His interests. Since He is fighting, we should be fighting also.</p>
<p>Actually, to fight is to be watchful. Only those who are fighting are truly watchful. The more we are fighting, the more watchful we will be. As long as we are fighting, we need not try to be watchful, for we will be watchful automatically. The Christian life, a holy life for the church life, is a life of fighting. We are on the battlefield, and we need to be alert, watchful, and vigilant.</p>
<p>In verse 4 Paul reminds us that we are not in darkness that the day should overtake us as a thief, and in verse 5 he points out that we are sons of light and sons of the day and thus are not of the night nor of darkness. Then in verse 6 he exhorts us to watch and be sober: &ldquo;So then let us not sleep, as the rest do, but let us watch and be sober.&rdquo; To sleep here is to be unwatchful. To watch is versus to sleep, and to be sober is versus to be drunk (v. 7). In view of the hope of the Lord&rsquo;s coming, we need to consider ourselves and ask whether we are watchful or sleeping, whether we are sober or drunk.</p>
<p>In verse 7 Paul says, &ldquo;For those who sleep, sleep during the night, and those who get drunk are drunk during the night.&rdquo; Here to be drunk is to be in a stupor. To be watchful and to be sober are related to safeguarding the three basic structures of the holy life for the church life: faith, love, and hope. Verse 8 indicates this: &ldquo;Since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and a helmet, the hope of salvation.&rdquo; The breastplate and the helmet here point to spiritual warfare. The breastplate, which covers and protects our heart and spirit according to God&rsquo;s righteousness (Eph. 6:14), is of faith and love; the helmet, which covers and protects our mentality, our mind, is the hope of salvation (v. 17). Faith, love, and hope are the three basic constructing elements of the genuine Christian life, as depicted in 1 Thessalonians 1:3. Faith is related to our will, a part of our heart (Rom. 10:9), and to our conscience, a part of our spirit (1 Tim. 1:19); love is related to our emotion, another part of our heart (Matt. 22:37); and hope is related to our understanding, the function of our mind. All these need to be protected so that a genuine Christian life can be maintained. Such a life is watchful and sober (1 Thes. 5:6-7). At the beginning of the Epistle, the apostle praised the believers&rsquo; work of faith, labor of love, and endurance of hope (1:3). Here, at the conclusion of the Epistle, he exhorted them to keep these spiritual virtues covered and protected by fighting for them.</p>
<p>The hope spoken of in 5:8 is the hope of our Lord&rsquo;s coming back, which will be our salvation from both the coming destruction and from the slavery of corruption of the old creation (Rom. 8:21-25). According to 1 Thessalonians 5:8, we need armor to safeguard our faith, love, and hope. If we would protect these aspects of the basic structure of a holy life for the church life, we need to be watchful and sober. Therefore, being watchful and sober should be part of our living as we hope in the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. We need a life of watchfulness and soberness in order to wait for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. In other words, as we exercise our hope in the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, we need a watchful life and a sober life.</p>
<p>Watchfulness here is related to a battle, a fight. Some versions use the word <em>vigilant,</em> a word related to warfare. Soldiers in a battle need to be watchful, vigilant. The fact that watchfulness is related to fighting is confirmed by Paul&rsquo;s mention of the breastplate and helmet in verse 8. A breastplate and helmet are not ordinary items of dress. They are, of course, part of the armor used by soldiers in fighting. Paul&rsquo;s concept of being watchful and sober, therefore, is related to fighting, to warfare. In these verses Paul is speaking in reference to battle.</p>
<p>It is important for us to see that watchfulness refers to a proper spirit in fighting a battle. To be watchful is to continue fighting. In these verses to be watchful is to remember that we are in a battle, that we are fighting and are surrounded by enemies. This is the reason that we need a helmet and also a breastplate.</p>
<p>To be sober is to be clear about everything related to the battle. It is to be clear about where the enemy is, what the enemy is doing, and how the enemy is attacking. It is also to be clear about how to protect ourselves and how to fight back. Those who are sober are fully clear about their situation. We need to be watchful and sober. This means that we need to keep on fighting. We also need to safeguard the structure of our Christian life by wearing the armor. Then when the Lord Jesus comes, we will be saved from the sudden destruction.</p>
<p>In verses 9 and 10 Paul says, &ldquo;God did not appoint us to wrath but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us in order that whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with Him.&rdquo; Since God did not appoint us to wrath, we should watch, be sober, and fight to cooperate with God that we may gain His salvation through the Lord Jesus. We are waiting for salvation from destruction and from the slavery of corruption. Then we will enjoy the freedom of the glory of the sons of God.</p>
<p>In verse 10 Paul speaks of living together with the Lord. The Lord died for us not only that we may be saved from eternal perdition but also that we may live together with Him, through His resurrection, a life that can save us from the coming destruction. We may live together with Him whether we watch or sleep, that is, whether we live or die. On the one hand, the Lord is away from us, and we are awaiting His coming back; on the other hand, He is with us (Matt. 28:20), and we can live together with Him (Rom. 6:8).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head4">g. The Cause of Our Complete Sanctification<br />
in Our Spirit, Soul, and Body</h2>
<p>The coming of Christ is the cause of the complete sanctification in our spirit, soul, and body. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, &ldquo;The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body. The spirit as our inmost part is the inner organ, possessing God-consciousness, that we may contact God (John 4:24; Rom. 1:9). The soul is our self (cf. Matt. 16:26; Luke 9:25), a medium between our spirit and our body, possessing self-consciousness, that we may have our personality. The body as our external part is the outer organ, possessing world-consciousness, that we may contact the material world. The body contains the soul, and the soul is the vessel that contains the spirit. In the spirit, God as the Spirit dwells; in the soul, our self dwells; and in the body, the physical senses dwell. God sanctifies us, first, by taking possession of our spirit through regeneration (John 3:5-6); second, by spreading Himself as the life-giving Spirit from our spirit into our soul to saturate and transform our soul (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18); and last, by enlivening our mortal body through our soul (Rom. 8:11, 13) and transfiguring our body by His life power (Phil. 3:21).</p>
<p>God not only has made us holy in position by the redeeming blood of Christ to separate us unto Himself in His judicial redemption; He also is sanctifying us in disposition by His own holy nature to saturate us with Himself in His organic salvation (Heb. 13:12; 10:29; Rom. 6:19, 22; Eph. 5:26). God&rsquo;s dispositional sanctification of our spirit, soul, and body is to &ldquo;sonize&rdquo; us divinely, making us sons of God that we may become the same as God is in His life and in His nature but not in His Godhead so that we can be God&rsquo;s expression (1:4-5; Heb. 2:10-11). By sanctifying us, God transforms us in the essence of our spirit, soul, and body, making us wholly like Him in nature.</p>
<p>God not only sanctifies us wholly but also preserves our spirit, soul, and body complete. <em>Wholly</em> is quantitative; <em>complete</em> is qualitative. Quantitatively, God sanctifies us wholly; qualitatively, God preserves us complete, that is, He keeps our spirit, soul, and body perfect. The word <em>wholly</em> means &ldquo;entirely, thoroughly, to the consummation.&rdquo; God sanctifies us wholly so that no part of our being&mdash;our spirit, soul, or body&mdash;will be left common or profane.</p>
<p>Through the fall our body was ruined, our soul was contaminated, and our spirit was deadened. In God&rsquo;s full salvation our entire being is saved and made complete and perfect. God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element (9:14), our soul from remaining natural and old (Matt. 16:24-26), and our body from the ruin of sin (1 Thes. 4:4; Rom. 6:6). God&rsquo;s preservation and His thorough sanctification sustain us to live a holy life unto maturity that we may meet the Lord in His parousia, His coming.</p>
<p>Although God preserves us, we need to take the responsibility, the initiative, to cooperate with His operation, to be preserved by keeping our spirit, soul, and body in the saturating of the Holy Spirit (1 Thes. 5:12-24). In the second part of verse 23 Paul says, &ldquo;May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame.&rdquo; In the first part of the verse concerning God&rsquo;s sanctifying us, it is God who takes the initiative. But in the second part of the verse concerning our spirit, soul, and body being preserved, we are the ones who should take the initiative. The command <em>be preserved</em> may be regarded as an active-passive verb. This means that we take the initiative to be preserved, although God is the One who preserves our spirit, soul, and body. Therefore, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I long to have my spirit, soul, and body preserved. However, I cannot do this work. I take the initiative, Lord, to ask You to do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In verse 23 Paul refers to &ldquo;the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Here Paul indicates that in order to be ready, prepared, and qualified for the coming back of the Lord Jesus, we must be sanctified wholly and preserved complete and without blame in our spirit, soul, and body.</p>
<p>In order to cooperate with God to preserve our spirit in sanctification, we must keep our spirit in a living condition by exercising our spirit. In order to preserve our spirit, we must keep our spirit living by exercising it to have fellowship with God. If we fail to exercise our spirit in this way, we will leave it in a deadened situation. To preserve our spirit is first of all to exercise our spirit, to keep it living and to pull it out of death. To rejoice, pray, and give thanks are to exercise our spirit (vv. 16-18). Moreover, we need to cooperate with the sanctifying God to be separated from a spirit-deadening situation (Num. 6:6-8; 2 Cor. 5:4). We must worship God, serve God, and fellowship with God in and with our spirit. Whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we do toward God must be in our spirit (John 4:24; Rom. 1:9; Phil. 2:1). In order to preserve our spirit, we should keep it from all defilement and contamination (2 Cor. 7:1) and exercise ourselves to have a conscience without offense toward God and men (Acts 24:16; Rom. 9:1; cf. 8:16).</p>
<p>In order to cooperate with God to preserve our soul in sanctification, we must take care of the three parts of our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will. In order for our soul to be sanctified, our mind must be renewed to be the mind of Christ (12:2), our emotion must be touched and saturated with the love of Christ (Eph. 3:17, 19), our will must be subdued by and infused with the resurrected Christ (Phil. 2:13; cf. S. S. 4:4a; 7:4a), and we must love the Lord with our whole being (Mark 12:30).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to make a thorough confession to the Lord. We should stay with the Lord for a period of time, asking Him to bring us fully into the light. In the shining of His light which exposes us, we should confess our defects, failures, defeats, mistakes, wrongdoings, and sins (1 John 1:5-9). We need to confess everything that is sinful in our thoughts and in our way of thinking. We need to confess the germs of rebellion in our will. We need to confess that we express our joy and sorrow in a natural and even fleshy way and that we often hate what we should love and love what we should hate.</p>
<p>In order to cooperate with God to preserve our body in sanctification, we must present our body to Him so that we may live a holy life for the church life, practicing the Body life in order to carry out God&rsquo;s perfect will (Rom. 12:1-2; 1 Thes. 4:4; 5:18). In order to have our body preserved, we should no longer live by our old man (Rom. 6:6). If we do not live by our old man, our body will be a slave to righteousness instead of a slave to sin (vv. 13, 19). Positively, we preserve our body by presenting it to God a living sacrifice (12:1). Then our body will even become a member of Christ (1 Cor. 6:15) so that we may live Christ, express Christ, and magnify Christ (Phil. 1:20). Furthermore, our body will be the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit for God&rsquo;s dwelling (1 Cor. 6:19). God dwells in our body to move and to express Himself, to glorify Himself. In this way our spirit, soul, and body will be preserved in the Triune God. This is a holy life, and this is to be saved in the sanctification of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head4">h. The Incentive of Our Suffering for Him</h2>
<p>Christ in His coming is the incentive of our suffering for Him. In 2 Thessalonians 1:7 Paul says, &ldquo;To you who are being afflicted, rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of His power, in flaming fire.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;rest&rdquo; also means &ldquo;relief, ease, repose, liberty.&rdquo; In this age the believers suffer persecutions and troubles for the Lord. At the Lord&rsquo;s coming back they will be relieved of their sufferings and enter into the Lord&rsquo;s rest and enjoy its liberty.</p>
<p>In verse 7 Paul speaks of the revelation of the Lord Jesus. Although the Lord is here today, He is veiled; His coming back will be the time of His unveiling. The universe is immeasurably vast in its dimensions, yet with the Lord there is no such thing as distance. He is everywhere. One day, at His coming, He will be unveiled, and everyone will see Him. At the unveiling of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of His power, we will rest. The time has not yet come for us to rest. Our rest will be at the Lord&rsquo;s coming, at His unveiling.</p>
<p>In verse 10 Paul speaks of Christ coming to be glorified in His saints: &ldquo;When He comes to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that day.&rdquo; The Lord is the Lord of glory (1 Cor. 2:8); He was glorified in His resurrection and ascension (John 17:1; Luke 24:26; Heb. 2:9). Now He is in us as the hope of glory (Col. 1:27) to bring us into glory (Heb. 2:10). At His coming back, on the one hand, He will come from the heavens with glory (Rev. 10:1; Matt. 25:31), and on the other hand, He will be glorified in His saints; that is, His glory will be manifested from within His members, causing their body of humiliation to be transfigured into His glory, conforming it to the body of His glory (Phil. 3:21). Thus, the unbelievers will marvel at Him, admire Him, and wonder at Him in us, His believers.</p>
<h2 class="head4">I. The Day of His Coming (Parousia&mdash;Presence)</h2>
<p>We are awaiting the day of His coming, His parousia, which is His personal presence. This day will come only after the apostasy (2 Thes. 2:3a) and the revelation of the man of lawlessness and sin&mdash;Antichrist (vv. 3b-4, 8-10)&mdash;who will be manifested during the last seven years of this age (Dan. 9:27; Matt. 24:21; cf. v. 15).</p>
<p>In 2 Thessalonians 2:1, Paul says, &ldquo;Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him.&rdquo; In this verse two matters are covered: the Lord&rsquo;s parousia (presence) and our gathering together (rapture) to Him. The Lord&rsquo;s parousia will begin with the rapture of the overcomers to the throne of God in heaven (Rev. 12:5-6); at the end of the great tribulation, which will occur in the last three and a half years of this age, the second half of the last week in Daniel 9:27 (Matt. 24:21; Rev. 11:2), His parousia will come to the air (10:1) and last for a time; and it will end with its manifestation, the manifestation of His coming (2 Thes. 2:8; Matt. 24:30). During the time in which the Lord&rsquo;s parousia remains in the air, the majority of the believers will be raptured to meet the Lord there (1 Thes. 4:17).</p>
<p>Second Thessalonians 2:2 says, &ldquo;That you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.&rdquo; According to the context, the expression <em>the day of the Lord</em> in this verse refers to the day of the Lord&rsquo;s parousia (coming), in which the rapture of the majority of the believers will occur.</p>
<p>In verse 3 Paul says, &ldquo;Let no one deceive you in any way, because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;deceive&rdquo; may also be rendered &ldquo;beguile,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;not only making a false impression but actually leading astray&rdquo; (Vincent).</p>
<p>In verse 3 the pronoun <em>it</em> refers to the day of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. This day will not come unless the apostasy comes first. This apostasy will be a falling away from the straight way of God&rsquo;s economy as revealed in the Scriptures. There is a strong prophecy in the Bible that before the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, there will be a great apostasy among His people, a falling away from the path of God&rsquo;s economy. Even today there is a tendency among some Christians to leave the straight way of the New Testament.</p>
<p>Verse 3 also indicates that the day of the Lord will not come before the man of lawlessness is revealed. This man of lawlessness is Antichrist, as prophesied in Daniel 7:20-21, 24-26; 8:9-12, 23-25; 9:27; 11:36-37; Revelation 13:1-8, 12-18; and 19:19-20. He will be the man of lawlessness, casting down the truth to the ground, changing laws, destroying and corrupting many to an extraordinary degree, blaspheming God, and deceiving men. Hence, the Lord will utterly destroy him, and he will become the son of perdition.</p>
<p> Second Thessalonians 2:3 indicates strongly that the Lord&rsquo;s coming back will not precede the tribulation. Before the Lord&rsquo;s coming there will first be the apostasy and also the revealing of the man of lawlessness. This means that prior to the Lord&rsquo;s coming, one matter&mdash;the apostasy&mdash;and one person&mdash;Antichrist&mdash;must appear first.</p>
<p>Paul told the Thessalonians that since the apostasy and the revealing of the man of lawlessness must come before the day of the Lord&rsquo;s coming, they should not be shaken by anything or anyone that would claim that the day of the Lord has already come. The apostasy must take place, and Antichrist must be revealed. Antichrist will be fully revealed during the great tribulation.</p>
<p>In verse 4 Paul gives a further description of Antichrist: &ldquo;who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or an object of worship, so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself forth, saying that he is God.&rdquo; This fulfills the prophecy concerning Antichrist in Daniel 11:36-37; it will take place in the midst of the last week, as prophesied in Daniel 9:27.</p>
<p>The temple of God mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 2:4 is &ldquo;the holy place&rdquo; in Matthew 24:15. Second Thessalonians 2:4 indicates that the temple of God will be rebuilt before the Lord comes back. The temple was destroyed more than nineteen centuries ago, but this verse says that Antichrist will seat himself in the temple of God. Therefore, the temple must be rebuilt. The nation of Israel has been formed again, and the city of Jerusalem has been returned to Israel. However, the temple has not yet been rebuilt. Some Jews are deeply stirred concerning the rebuilding of the temple. One day this temple will be rebuilt, and, according to the prophecy of Daniel, Antichrist will seat himself in it.</p>
<p>In verse 6 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Now you know that which restrains, so that he might be revealed in his own time.&rdquo; This verse indicates that some power hinders the revelation of the man of lawlessness, Antichrist.</p>
<p>In verse 7 Paul continues, &ldquo;It is the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating, but only until the one now restraining goes out of the way.&rdquo; The lawlessness that will characterize Antichrist is already operating in this age mysteriously. It is the mystery of lawlessness working today among the nations and in human society. Even now there is a tendency for lawlessness to be prevailing. Antichrist will be the totality of lawlessness.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s sovereignty, there is one who restrains now until he goes out of the way. This probably means that the restraining factor will eventually be taken out of the way. Although the mystery of lawlessness is already operating, this lawlessness is at the present time restrained, restricted. But one day this restrainer will be taken away. We need to realize from the prophecy of the Bible that one day the restraining factor will be removed, and then Antichrist will be unrestricted.</p>
<p>Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Then the lawless one will be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of His coming).&rdquo; This will be fulfilled in Revelation 19:19-20. This verse indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s coming (parousia) is hidden before it is manifested openly. This indicates also that the Lord&rsquo;s coming involves a period of time. It will remain in secret, and then it will be manifested to the public.</p>
<p>Speaking of Antichrist in verse 9, Paul says, &ldquo;The coming of whom is according to Satan&rsquo;s operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie.&rdquo; This verse reveals that the coming of Antichrist is according to the operation of Satan. The reason Antichrist will be so lawless is that he will be under Satan&rsquo;s operation. Due to the motivation of Satan, he will become extremely powerful. The operation of Satan is with power and signs and wonders of a lie. The entire operation of Satan to deceive people (v. 10) is in its totality a lie, just as he is a liar and the father of liars (John 8:44).</p>
<p>In summary, Paul speaks of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him. Paul also tells the believers not to be quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit, by word, or by letter as if by the apostles that the day of the Lord is present. He also charges them not to allow anyone to deceive them. Then Paul goes on to say that the day of the Lord will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness, Antichrist, is revealed in his own time. At present, although the mystery of lawlessness is already working, there is a restraining factor, but one day this factor will be removed. Then the lawless one will be revealed. However, the Lord Jesus will slay him by the breath of His mouth and bring him to nothing by the manifestation of His coming. The coming of the lawless one will be according to the operation of Satan, in all power, signs, and wonders of a lie and in all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth that they might be saved. Because of this, God will send them an operation of error that they might believe the lie. After the apostasy and the revealing of the man of lawlessness, there will be the appearing of the Lord&rsquo;s parousia. The revelation of Antichrist will be completed during the last seven years of this age. This revelation of Antichrist must be first, and then there will be the appearing of the Lord&rsquo;s parousia.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">84. The Savior of Sinners</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:12-17 Christ is revealed as the Savior of sinners.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Saving Even the Foremost Sinner</h2>
<p>In verse 15 Paul says, &ldquo;Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost.&rdquo; This verse reveals that Christ the Savior saved Paul, who considered himself the foremost sinner (v. 16). In verse 13 Paul says of himself, &ldquo;Who formerly was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insulting person; but I was shown mercy because, being ignorant, I acted in unbelief.&rdquo; A blasphemer is one who blasphemes God, and a persecutor is one who persecutes man. Saul of Tarsus, a strict Pharisee (Acts 22:3; Phil. 3:4-5), could never have blasphemed God. But he did speak evilly of the Lord Jesus. Here he confessed that this was blasphemy. This indicates that he believed in the deity of Christ. Saul of Tarsus persecuted the church in an insulting, destructive way (Acts 22:4; Gal. 1:13, 23), just as the insulting Jews persecuted the Lord Jesus (Matt. 26:59, 67). Paul also says that he was ignorant and acted in unbelief. To be ignorant means to be in darkness, and unbelief comes from blindness. Saul of Tarsus was in darkness and acted in blindness when he opposed God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Yet Christ Jesus, as the Savior of sinners, came into the world, into the fallen human race, to save this foremost sinner.</p>
<p>Christ came into the world to be our Savior by incarnation (John 1:14). He was God incarnated that He might save us through His death and resurrection in His human body. In coming to save sinners, Christ took the sinners as His object. His heart is to save us, the sinners in the world. He came into the world to save us from our sins and to give us His divine life (Matt. 1:21; John 10:10). In the local churches this should be constantly announced as the glad tidings.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Through Mercy</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:16 Paul declares, &ldquo;Because of this I was shown mercy, that in me, the foremost, Jesus Christ might display all His long-suffering for a pattern to those who are to believe on Him unto eternal life.&rdquo; This verse indicates that Christ saved Paul through the mercy of God. Saul of Tarsus, the foremost among sinners, became a pattern to sinners, showing that sinners can be visited by God&rsquo;s mercy and saved by the Lord&rsquo;s grace. In verse 13 Paul testifies that he was shown mercy. Saul, a blasphemer and a persecutor, first was shown mercy and then received grace (v. 14). Mercy reaches farther toward the unworthy one than grace does. Because Saul was one who blasphemed God and persecuted man, God&rsquo;s mercy reached him before the Lord&rsquo;s grace did.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. By His Grace Superabounding<br />
with Faith and Love in Him</h2>
<p>In verse 14 Paul says, &ldquo;The grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Christ saved Paul not only through God&rsquo;s mercy but also His grace. The Lord&rsquo;s grace, coming after God&rsquo;s mercy, visited Saul of Tarsus and not only abounded but superabounded in him with faith and love in Christ. One day he received mercy and grace from the Lord not only to believe in Him but also to love Him. The Lord&rsquo;s grace superabounded with faith and love in Christ to the apostle Paul for his dynamic and excellent salvation that he might be one of the greatest apostles.</p>
<p>We have been given faith to believe into Christ, and we have been given God&rsquo;s love to love the Lord Jesus. In the Gospel of John we are taught that we need to believe into Christ the Son (1:12) and love Him (14:23). The Gospel of John presents these as the two requirements for us to participate in the Lord. The Lord is within us to be our faith and our love.</p>
<p>Apart from the grace of God, none of us could have faith and love in Christ. It is a wonder that we can believe in Jesus and love Him whom we have never seen (1 Pet. 1:8). It is not a small thing for a sinner to believe in Christ and continue in loving Him. To love Jesus is a miracle of the superabounding grace.</p>
<p>Faith and love are products of the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Mercy and grace come to us from the Lord; faith and love return to the Lord from us. This is a spiritual traffic between the Lord and us. Through faith we receive the Lord (John 1:12), and through love we enjoy the Lord whom we have received (14:21, 23; 21:15-17). We need to have faith and love to match His grace so that we may enjoy Christ as our great Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Unto Eternal Life</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:16 Paul speaks of believing on Christ &ldquo;unto eternal life.&rdquo; The uncreated life of God is the ultimate gift and topmost blessing given by God to those who believe on Christ. Christ&rsquo;s salvation is unto eternal life. The word <em>unto</em> in verse 16 means &ldquo;resulting in.&rdquo; When we enjoy Christ as our great Savior and receive His wonderful salvation, the result of this enjoyment is eternal life. Now we may enjoy this eternal life in our daily living.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Even to Be Empowered to Serve Him Faithfully</h2>
<p>In verse 12 Paul declares, &ldquo;I give thanks to Him who empowers me, Christ Jesus our Lord, that He has counted me faithful, appointing me to the ministry.&rdquo; By His saving grace, Christ not only appointed the apostle to the ministry and commissioned him with God&rsquo;s economy outwardly but also empowered him inwardly to carry out His ministry, fulfill His commission, and serve Him faithfully. This is altogether a matter of life in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. For the Honor and Glory to the King of the Ages, Incorruptible, Invisible, the Only God Forever</h2>
<p>In verse 17 Paul says, &ldquo;Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s praise to God in this verse is related to the decline of the church. The church may decline, deteriorate, and become degraded, but God is incorruptible. He remains the same. He is the King of eternity. In spite of the church&rsquo;s decline, Paul had a strong faith with an absolute assurance that the God in whom he believed, the One who had entrusted him with the gospel, is the King of the ages, incorruptible, unchangeable, and worthy of honor and glory.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s saving grace empowers us to serve Him faithfully for the honor and glory of the King of the ages. The One who is the King of the ages is incorruptible, invisible, and the only God forever; our being saved by the divine life will give honor and glory to the King.</p>
<h2 class="head3">85. The Mediator of God and Men</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 2:5-6 Christ is presented as the Mediator of God and men.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Man, Christ Jesus</h2>
<p>In verse 5 Paul says, &ldquo;There is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.&rdquo; In this verse Paul tells us that there is one Mediator of God and men. A mediator is a go-between. The one Mediator is the man Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus was God from eternity (John 1:1). In time He became a man through incarnation (v. 14). While He was living on earth as a man, He was also God (1 Tim. 3:16). After resurrection He was still man, as well as God (Acts 7:56; John 20:28). Because He is both man and God, He is the only One qualified to be the Mediator, the go-between, of God and men.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Who Gave Himself as a Ransom on Behalf of All</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 2:6 Paul tells us that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself as a ransom for all.&rdquo; Christ gave Himself for the accomplishing of redemption for all men. This was necessary in order that He might be our Mediator. He is qualified to be the Mediator between God and man, not only in His divine and human person but also in His redemptive work. Both His person and His work are unique.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">(69)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">86. God Manifested in the Flesh</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 3:15-16 Christ is presented as God manifested in the flesh. This is one of the greatest aspects of Christ for our experience and enjoyment. Not only was the Lord Jesus the manifestation of God in the flesh in the past; the church today should also be the manifestation of God in the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Great Mystery of Godliness</h2>
<p>In verse 16 Paul says, &#8220;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&#8221; The word <em>godliness</em> in this verse means &#8220;God-likeness.&#8221; Hence, this verse indicates that human beings may have the appearance, the expression, and the manifestation of God. In the context of this verse, the phrase <em>the mystery of godliness</em> means that God in His mystery can be manifested and expressed in the flesh, in human beings. Godliness is God manifested in the flesh; the mystery of godliness is God manifested in human beings. The transition from <em>the mystery of godliness</em> to <em>He</em> implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness (Col. 1:27; Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>God&#8217;s manifestation was first in Christ as an individual expression in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16; Col. 2:9; John 1:1, 14). The New Testament does not say that only the Son of God was incarnated. Rather, it reveals that God was manifested in the flesh, indicating that the entire God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-was incarnated. Therefore, Christ in His incarnation was the entire God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>According to the Gospel of John, the Word, who is God, became flesh (vv. 1, 14). The God who the Word is, is not a partial God but the entire God-God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. The Word is God&#8217;s definition, explanation, and expression. Hence, the Word who became flesh-God manifested in the flesh-is God&#8217;s definition, explanation, and expression in the flesh (v. 18). God was manifested in the flesh not only as the Son but as the entire Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<p>Through incarnation and human living (vv. 1, 14), God was manifested in the flesh. The expression <em>in the flesh</em> means &#8220;in the likeness, in the fashion, of man&#8221; (Rom. 8:3; Phil. 2:7-8). Christ appeared to people in the form of man (2 Cor. 5:16), yet He was God manifested in a man.</p>
<p>God desired to become a man, and one day He became a man in the person of Christ, living on earth as a God-man. Christ lived in His humanity on the earth to express God for thirty-three and a half years. He is God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16). He is the faithful Witness of God (Rev. 1:5), and He witnessed God.</p>
<p>When He lived on earth as the God-man, He did not live by His human life but by His divine life. He lived a human life not by His humanity but by His divinity. He lived as a God-man yet not by the life of man but by the life of God. Hence, His human living was not lived out by the human life but by the divine life. He lived by always rejecting His human life, by always putting His human life under the cross. From the first day He lived on earth, He lived a crucified human life, not by His human life but by His divine life. His human living did not express humanity but divinity in the divine attributes becoming the human virtues. This is what Paul meant in 1 Timothy 3 when he spoke of Christ as God manifested in the flesh (v. 16).</p>
<p>The incarnation of Christ produced a God-man who lived on the earth not by His human life but by His divine life. All of His days on earth, He put Himself on the cross. He remained on the cross to die so that He might live by God, not to express man but to express God in His divine attributes becoming man&#8217;s virtues. This was the life of the first God-man as a prototype. Since today we are His reproduction, we should live the same kind of life.</p>
<p>To follow Jesus is to live the life of a God-man, not by the human life but by the divine life, in order that God may be expressed, or manifested, in the flesh in all His divine attributes becoming the human virtues. This is the intrinsic significance of what it is to follow Christ. As God-men, we need to live a life not by ourselves but by another One, not by our human life but by His divine life, not to express ourselves but to express His divinity in His divine attributes which become our human virtues.</p>
<p>God being manifested in the flesh is God living a human life. We should not try to be angels, because God is not manifested in the angels but in the flesh. This means that God is living a human life. The Lord Jesus was a real, perfect man to express the complete God. He was God manifested in the flesh to express the eternal, infinite, invisible, glorious, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent God through the mortal, finite, visible, inglorious man, limited in power, knowledge, and presence. Mortal is versus eternal, finite is versus infinite, visible is versus invisible, and inglorious is versus glorious. God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and present everywhere, but man is limited in power, knowledge, and presence.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He expressed the divine attributes as His human virtues in all His actions. That expression of His virtues was the manifestation of God in the flesh. Outwardly, people saw Him as Jesus from Nazareth, but He was God manifested in the flesh. For example, after the Lord Jesus fed the five thousand, there were many leftovers. If those leftovers had been left there as a mess, this would have been a poor testimony. But the Lord instructed His disciples to gather the broken pieces left over that nothing would be lost (John 6:12). After all the leftovers were picked up, everything was clean and in order. This was the virtue of the One who is resurrection (11:25). When the Lord left the things in the tomb in good order, this was also a testimony of His resurrection (20:7). When we exercise our spirit and do things in resurrection, this is a display of our Christian virtues. These Christian virtues are expressions of the divine attributes and are the manifestation of God in the flesh. This is God&#8217;s living in man.</p>
<p>If we do things in resurrection, many virtues will be exhibited, and those virtues will be the expression of the divine attributes. Thus, what we do will be a manifestation of God in the flesh. In the church life God should be manifested in the flesh. Even though we are in the flesh, we should not live by the flesh. We should live in and by resurrection so that God may live in our living, making us Him in His attributes as our virtues for His manifestation.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:15-16 indicates that not only Christ Himself as the Head is the manifestation of God in the flesh but also that the church as the Body of Christ and the house of God is the manifestation of God in the flesh-the mystery of godliness. According to the context, <em>godliness</em> in verse 16 refers not only to piety but also to the living of God in the church, that is, to God as life lived out in the church. Both Christ and the church are the mystery of godliness, expressing God in the flesh. The church life is the expression of God; therefore, the mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church (1 Cor. 14:24-25). God is manifested in the church-the house of God and the Body of Christ-as His enlarged corporate expression in the flesh (Eph. 2:19; 1:22-23).</p>
<p>The manifestation of God in the flesh began with Christ when He was on earth (John 14:9). The manifestation of God in the flesh continues with the church, which is the increase, enlargement, and multiplication of the manifestation of God in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:15-16). Such a church becomes the continuation of Christ&#8217;s manifestation of God in the flesh-Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God. This is God manifested in the flesh in a wider way according to the New Testament principle of incarnation (1 Cor. 7:40; Gal. 2:20). The principle of incarnation is that God enters into man and mingles Himself with man to make man one with Himself (John 15:4-5). The principle of incarnation means that divinity is brought into humanity and works within humanity (1 Cor. 6:17; 7:40; 1 Tim. 4:1). The great mystery of godliness is that God has become man so that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead to produce a corporate God-man for the manifestation of God in the flesh (Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4; Eph. 4:24).</p>
<p>Although we were sinners, we have been redeemed out of our sinful position and sinful situation. We are now redeemed ones. God has imparted Himself into us, making us one with Him and also making Him one with us. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221; This is the great mystery of godliness-God manifested in the flesh. We are the same as God in the divine life, the divine nature, the divine element, and the divine essence but not in the Godhead. Today we are the flesh in which God can be manifested. God is manifested in the flesh, but we need to realize that God can never be manifested by the flesh. The flesh is merely the earthen vessel. It is not the key to carry out God&#8217;s manifestation; the key to God&#8217;s manifestation in us is our spirit.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 4:7 Paul goes on to tell us that we should exercise ourselves unto godliness. To exercise ourselves unto godliness is to exercise our spirit so that we may express the mystery of godliness-God manifested in the flesh. This is indicated by Paul&#8217;s words in 2 Timothy 1:6-7, which says, &#8220;For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.&#8221; Second Timothy 4:22 tells us that the Lord is with our spirit. Since the Lord Jesus as the mystery of godliness is in our spirit, in order to express and practice this mystery, we need to exercise ourselves unto godliness by exercising our spirit.</p>
<p>Before we do anything, we should exercise our spirit. Then our spirit will lead us, and whatever we do will be godliness, God manifested in the flesh. This is the exercise unto godliness. In everything we need to exercise ourselves unto godliness. Before we speak, we should exercise our spirit unto godliness. Therefore, we must live, walk, have our daily life, and have our whole being according to our spirit (Rom. 8:4). Paul exhorted Timothy to pray for those &#8220;who are in high position; that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness and gravity&#8221; (1 Tim. 2:2). If we are godly, it will affect the choice of pictures we hang in our bedroom, the kind of clothes that we wear, our hair style, and our conversation. The inward life of godliness has an outward expression. Such a manifestation of godliness is a testimony and has an impact on those who meet us. In whatever we say, whatever we do, whatever we wear, there should be an impression that God is manifested in us.</p>
<p>In the church life there should be the manifestation of God in the flesh. In order for this to be the situation, there must be in the church the glorious union of God and man. Inwardly we should have God, but God is manifested in the flesh through a normal and proper humanity. All those in the church life-the brothers and the sisters, the elderly ones and the young ones-should behave in a way that is normal and fitting for their respective ages. Instead of pretense, there should be a genuineness that is both human and divine. This is the condition of God being manifested in humanity.</p>
<p>The church as the house of God is the living God becoming flesh and being manifested in the flesh. In the four Gospels God was manifested in the flesh in Jesus as a single individual. But in 1 Timothy 3 God&#8217;s manifestation in the flesh is in the entire church corporately. Not only is Christ the great mystery of godliness, but in principle the church is also God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>Christ is the manifestation of God in the flesh, but so is the church. We are the church, but we are still in the flesh. When we meet together in the Spirit, God is manifested among us; this is the manifestation of God in the flesh. Just as Christ the Head is the manifestation of God in the flesh, so also is His Body. If the whole church is gathered together in a proper way, and an unbeliever comes in, &#8220;falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that indeed God is among you&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:23-25). God&#8217;s presence is known whenever the church meets together properly. We admit that we are still flesh, but the God who lives in our spirit will be manifested, expressed, in our flesh. This manifestation must be not merely individual but corporate. Because the proper church life is the corporate manifestation of God in the flesh, the church of the living God is the consummate mystery of godliness. For the church to be the corporate expression of God in the flesh, everyone in the church must be transformed (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>Ultimately, God will be manifested in the New Jerusalem as the consummated corporate expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1-2, 10-11). The church as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the house of God, but the New Jerusalem will be the city of God, signifying that the New Jerusalem, as the manifestation of God in the new creation, will be the enlargement and consummation of the church to express God in eternity.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Justified in the Spirit, Seen by Angels,<br />
Preached among the Nations, Believed On in the World, and Taken Up in Glory</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 3:16 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Justified in the Spirit</h2>
<p>Christ, God manifested in the flesh, was &ldquo;justified in the Spirit.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;justified&rdquo; also means &ldquo;vindicated.&rdquo; The incarnated Christ in His human living was not only justified as the Son of God by the Spirit (Matt. 3:16-17; Rom. 1:3-4) but was also vindicated, proved, and approved as right and righteous by the Spirit (Matt. 3:15-16; 4:1). He was manifested in the flesh but was vindicated and justified in the Spirit. He appeared in the flesh, but He lived in the Spirit (Luke 4:1, 14; Matt. 12:28) and offered Himself to God through the Spirit (Heb. 9:14). His transfiguration (Matt. 17:2) and His resurrection are both justifications in the Spirit. Furthermore, in resurrection He even became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17) to dwell and live in us (Rom. 8:9-10) for the manifestation of God in the flesh as the mystery of godliness. Hence, now we know Him and His members no longer according to the flesh but according to the Spirit (2 Cor. 5:16). Since the manifestation of God in the flesh is justified in the Spirit, and the Spirit is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16), we must live and behave in our spirit that this justification may be accomplished.</p>
<p>The church as the mystery of godliness is justified in the spirit. To be justified in the Spirit, we must walk and live in our regenerated human spirit (Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16, 25). If we walk and live in our spirit, we will have a justified life, that is, a life that can be justified by God. God is manifested in the flesh of those who are the mystery of godliness. However, we should not live by our flesh. Instead, we should live by our spirit. Through our living by our spirit, God will be manifested in our flesh. Although we are in the flesh, we should live by the spirit. We must walk, live, and do things by the spirit. In this way God becomes our living in our spirit and is manifested in our flesh. Such a living will be justified in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Seen by Angels</h2>
<p>In verse 16 Paul also says, &ldquo;Seen by angels.&rdquo; Angels saw the incarnation, human living, and ascension of Christ (Luke 2:9-14; Matt. 4:11; Acts 1:10-11; Rev. 5:6, 11-12). When the Lord Jesus was born, a host of angels praised God (Luke 2:10-14). If the angels rejoiced at the birth of the Lord Jesus in Bethlehem, the city of David, will they not also rejoice to see God manifested in the church, which is Christ&rsquo;s increase and enlargement? Furthermore, when the Lord Jesus, living out God and manifesting Him on earth, confronted the demons, they cried out. In at least one case they begged the Lord Jesus not to order them to depart into the abyss (8:31). If the demons trembled at the presence of the Lord Jesus, will they not also tremble at the manifestation of the living God in the church? No doubt when the church is living out God and manifesting Him, the demons and the evil angels will be terrified. Every local church must be a place where Christ is born anew in the saints. Furthermore, every local church must live out God in such a way that the devil&rsquo;s time is shortened. When the churches come up to God&rsquo;s standard, the angels will sing and rejoice, and the demons and the evil angels will tremble.</p>
<p>In the church life we are expressing God. Human beings may not realize this adequately, but the angels recognize it and appreciate it. All the angels are spectators who are looking at the universal man, Christ and the church, living in the spirit to manifest God in the flesh (Eph. 3:10). On the one hand, the good angels rejoice when they behold the expression of God in the church. On the other hand, the evil angels and the demons tremble in fear. They realize that eventually those in the church life will condemn them to the lake of fire.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) Preached among the Nations<br />
and Believed On in the World</h2>
<p>Christ was also preached among the nations. Christ as God&rsquo;s manifestation in the flesh has been preached as the gospel among the nations, including the nation of Israel, from the day of Pentecost (Rom. 16:26; Eph. 3:8). Furthermore, Christ has been &ldquo;believed on in the world&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:16). Christ as the embodiment of God in the flesh has been believed on, received as Savior and life, by people in the world (Acts 13:48).</p>
<p>Through our living in the spirit that manifests God in the flesh, God in Christ as the Spirit is being preached among the nations and is being believed on in the world. The real gospel preaching takes place when we live in the spirit to manifest God. Such a living can be not only seen by the angels but also preached to the uttermost part of the earth (1:8). When this gospel is preached, other human beings will see what we are living and then receive what we are living. This is not a preaching merely by word but a preaching mainly by life, a preaching by living. We must live out what we preach. Our message should be our life, our living. Although we may sometimes preach the gospel with words, we preach mainly by living a life that manifests God. Our living is our preaching. Regardless of how much believers preach by speaking, what eventually causes sinners to believe is the testimony of the believers&rsquo; living. We must have a living that is in the spirit to manifest God. This kind of living is our preaching, and our preaching must be this kind of living.</p><h2 class="head5">(4) Taken Up in Glory</h2>
<p>Paul concludes 1 Timothy 3:16 with the phrase <em>taken up in glory.</em> This refers to Christ&rsquo;s ascension into glory (Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11; 2:33; Phil. 2:9). According to the sequence of historical events, Christ&rsquo;s ascension preceded His being preached among the nations. However, it is listed here as the last step in Christ&rsquo;s being the manifestation of God in the flesh. This must indicate that the church too is taken up in glory. Hence, it implies that not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body are the manifestation of God in the flesh. When a church is well taken care of according to the instructions given in the first two chapters of 1 Timothy, with the oversight of the elders and the service of the deacons fully established, as revealed in chapter 3, the church will function as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth, and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world. Then the church becomes the continuation of Christ&rsquo;s manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness&mdash;Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh.</p>
<p>Although Christ was taken up in glory (Acts 1:9) before the preaching of Him began in Acts 2, Paul mentions this last, not only after the preaching but even after being believed on in the world. This indicates that <em>taken up in glory</em> may include not only the ascension of Christ but also the rapture of the church. The Head, Christ, was taken up before the preaching of Him began; however, the Body, the church, will be taken up only after Christ has been preached and believed on in the world. Therefore, in 1 Timothy 3:16 there is a definite indication that this verse refers not only to the Head as the manifestation of God in the flesh but also to the Body as the continuation of this manifestation. The Head, Christ, has been taken up in glory, and the Body, the church, will also be taken up in glory. Both the Head and the Body are the mystery of godliness.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Truth Borne by the Church of the Living God</h2>
<p>Christ as God manifested in the flesh is the truth borne by the church of the living God. In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul speaks of the house of God, which is &ldquo;the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo; In speaking of the church as the house of God, Paul specifically refers to God as the living God. The living God who lives in the church must be subjective to the church rather than merely objective. An idol in a heathen temple is lifeless. The God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living. Because He is living, the church is also living in Him, by Him, and with Him. A living God and a living church live, move, and work together. The living church is the house and the household of the living God. Hence, it becomes the manifestation of God in the flesh.</p>
<p>Everything in the church must be living because this is the house of the living God. We should not do anything in the church according to dead rules or dead forms. Everything we do or practice in the church life must be living because we are serving a living God (Heb. 9:14).</p>
<p>Speaking metaphorically, Paul speaks of the church as &ldquo;the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo; The pillar supports the building, and the base holds the pillar. The church is such a supporting pillar and holding base of the truth. The truth here refers to the real things which are revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The truth is the reality and the contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This economy is composed of two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the contents of the reality of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The church is the supporting pillar and holding base of all these realities. A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church.</p>
<p>To God, the church has the function to bear all that God is as the reality, the truth, of the universe. The word <em>reality</em> is better than <em>truth</em> in conveying the proper meaning, because <em>truth</em> can be misunderstood as doctrines. This may cause people to think that the church holds doctrines. No, the church is not for holding doctrines but for holding the reality of all that God is. In the universe, only God is reality; all that He is, is reality, which is borne by the church. We are here as the church, the house and household of God, holding the reality of all that God is.</p>
<p>The truth borne by the church is the Triune God, having Christ as the embodiment, center, and expression, to produce the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God (Col. 2:9; Eph. 1:22-23; 4:16; 1 Tim. 3:15; John 3:3, 5). The truth, the reality, is Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of God. The church bears Christ as the reality. The church testifies to the whole universe that Christ, and Christ alone, is the reality (1:14, 17; 14:6). As the pillar and base of the truth, the church bears the reality of the Triune God. The church stands not for doctrine but for the truth, the reality of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In Greek the word <em>truth</em> in 1 Timothy 3:15 denotes something real and solid. Hence, <em>truth</em> means &ldquo;reality.&rdquo; However, truth is not simply a solid reality but also the expression of this reality. Truth is not vain doctrine; it is the expression of reality, doctrine constituted with reality and conveying that reality. The church is the pillar bearing the truth, that is, bearing the expression of the reality.</p>
<p>The reality borne by the church is revealed in 1 Timothy 3:16: &ldquo;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.&rdquo; The truth in verse 15, the expression of the reality, is the mystery of godliness in verse 16. As previously mentioned, the mystery of godliness is God manifested in the flesh. When Christ was on earth, He was God manifested in the flesh. Outwardly, He was a man in the flesh; inwardly, in actuality and in reality, He was God. God in His reality was manifested in the man Jesus. God was reality, and Jesus as a man in the flesh was the manifestation of God. This is the truth mentioned in verse 15, and this is the mystery of godliness.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John confirms that the truth in 1 Timothy 3:15 refers to the manifestation of God in the flesh. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 14 continues, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.&rdquo; That this reality, this truth, has become flesh is indicated by verse 17, which says, &ldquo;Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Furthermore, in John 14:6 the Lord Jesus, the God who created all things and became flesh, declared that He is the reality. These verses indicate that <em>truth</em> refers to God becoming man, God entering into man, God being joined to man, and God being manifested in man; thus, the truth is God manifested in the flesh. The church is the pillar and base of the truth of God being manifested in the flesh. As a pillar and base of the truth, the church upholds and presents to the universe the fact of God&rsquo;s manifestation in the flesh.</p>
<p>In summary, God manifested in the flesh implies God manifested not only in Christ, the Head, but also in the church, His Body. When Christ lived on the earth, God was manifested in the flesh of Christ; now in the church age, the same God is manifested in the flesh of the believers, who compose the church. This is the great mystery of godliness, that is, the great mystery of the expression of God. The manifestation of God first in the flesh of Christ and then in the flesh of the members of His Body is a great mystery. Such a manifestation of God in the flesh is witnessed by and justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and taken up in glory. The manifestation of God in the flesh is also the truth, the reality, borne by the church of the living God. Today the church is not only the manifestation of God in the flesh but also the bearer of the truth of the living God. In the universe God alone is the reality, and this reality rests upon the church. Therefore, the church is the pillar and base of the truth, bearing the Triune God Himself, who is the unique reality in the universe.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">87. The One Who Brought Life and<br />
Incorruption to Light</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 1 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the One who brought life and incorruption to light in order that we might know life and incorruption. It is through the gospel that Christ brought life and incorruption to light (v. 10). While we may know life and incorruption, the unbelievers know only death and corruption because they have not yet heard or received the gospel. If they hear and receive the gospel, it will bring eternal life and eternal incorruption to light so that they may know life and incorruption as we do. The more we preach the gospel, the more life and incorruption will be brought to light. On the one hand, Christ appeared with grace; that is, He came with grace. On the other hand, by His death and resurrection, Christ nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel in order to fulfill the promise of life for a believer to be an apostle.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Appearing with Grace</h2>
<p>In verses 9 and 10 Paul tells us that the grace of God, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages, now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. Grace is God&rsquo;s provision in life given to us so that we may live out His purpose. This grace given to us in Christ was bestowed on us before the world began. God&rsquo;s grace was given to us in eternity, but it was manifested and applied to us through our Lord&rsquo;s first coming, in which He nullified death and brought life to us (Heb. 9:26). Because this grace was manifested through the appearing of Christ, Old Testament saints such as Abraham and David did not experience it. The grace destined to be given to us came with the appearing of the Lord Jesus. This grace is not merely a blessing; it is a person, the Triune God Himself given to us to be our enjoyment. This grace came when the Lord Jesus appeared, and now it is with us today.</p>
<p>Grace did not come until the Lord Jesus came. This is indicated by John 1:17, which says, &ldquo;Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The grace which came through Jesus Christ is nothing less than the Triune God dispensed into us for our enjoyment. This grace carries out God&rsquo;s purpose and enables us to reach His goal.</p>
<p>Grace works in two ways. It works negatively to nullify death, and it works positively to bring in life and incorruption. This work of grace is still taking place within us. Today in the church life grace is nullifying death and bringing life and incorruption to light through the gospel. Many people need to hear that the gospel of grace nullifies death and brings in life and incorruption.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Nullifying Death</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 1:10 Paul tells us that Christ nullified death. This means that He made death of none effect through His devil-destroying death (Heb. 2:14) and death-swallowing resurrection (1 Cor. 15:52-54). Christ was manifested to nullify death and to bring in eternal, indestructible life. He not only defeated death&mdash;He nullified it. Through His resurrection, death has become of none effect; death has lost its power, even its taste. Christ could nullify death because He destroyed the devil, the one who has the might of death. Of course, by overcoming Satan and nullifying death, the Lord Jesus also defeated Hades and the grave. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection declares that He is victorious over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave (vv. 55-57). No longer are these a problem. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was not only God&rsquo;s vindication and the Lord&rsquo;s success but also His victory over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave. Christ through His resurrection has made this troublesome group of none effect. His resurrection demonstrated that He triumphed over Satan, death, Hades, and the grave (Heb. 2:14; Acts 2:31). Through His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) to impart God&rsquo;s life to us (John 3:15) and regenerate us (1 Pet. 1:3). Thus, having nullified death through His death, He brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel in His resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Bringing Life and Incorruption to Light<br />
through the Gospel</h2>
<p>The last part of verse 10 speaks of Christ Jesus who &ldquo;brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.&rdquo; In the gospel the revelation is brought to us that Christ has nullified death and has brought us eternal, indestructible life. <em>Life</em> in verse 10 refers to the eternal life of God, which is given to all believers in Christ (1 Tim. 1:16) and which is the main element of the divine grace given to us (Rom. 5:17, 21). This life has conquered death (Acts 2:24) and will swallow up death (2 Cor. 5:4). It was according to the promise of such a life that Paul was an apostle (2 Tim. 1:1). This life and the incorruption that is its consequence have been brought to light and made visible to men through the preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>Life is the divine element, even God Himself, imparted into our spirit; incorruption is the consequence of life&rsquo;s saturating of our body (Rom. 8:11). This life and incorruption are able to counter death and corruption.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Even to Fulfill the Promise of Life<br />
for His Believer to Be an Apostle</h2>
<p>Christ brought life and incorruption to light to fulfill the promise of life for a believer to be an apostle. Second Timothy 1:1 speaks of Paul as &ldquo;an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This verse indicates that Paul became an apostle not only through the will of God but also according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus. The divine life, which God promised in the Old Testament and which Paul received and lived by, constituted him into an apostle; by receiving, enjoying, and living by the promised life, he, the foremost sinner, became an apostle, even the foremost apostle (1 Tim. 1:15-16, 12).</p>
<p>The expression <em>the promise of life</em> in 2 Timothy 1:1 does not mean that we have only the promise and not the life. It means that we have received the promised life. A similar term, <em>the promise of the Spirit,</em> is used in Galatians 3:14. This term does not mean that we have received only the promise and not the Spirit; it means that we have received the Spirit who has been promised. In the same principle, the words <em>the promise of life</em> denote the promised life. Paul was an apostle according to the life which God had promised, which Paul had received, and which dwelt within him. Paul became an apostle by this life.</p>
<p>This indicates that we can receive this promised life so that we may not only have this life and live by this life but also serve God to the uttermost as an apostle. In the Bible the highest office for servants of God is that of the apostle (1 Cor. 12:28). The Old Testament speaks of priests as servants of God, but the New Testament speaks of apostles. Because the new testament economy is higher than the old testament economy, to be an apostle is higher than to be a priest. An apostle is one who has received the promised life and lives by this life; receiving the divine life and living by the divine life constitutes one to be an apostle. The divine life can do so much for us that by enjoying Christ as the One who brought life to light, we may serve God as apostles.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, 2 Timothy 1:11 says, &ldquo;For which I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.&rdquo; The relative pronoun <em>which</em> refers to the gospel of divine grace and eternal life. This corresponds with the gospel in grace and life presented by the apostle John (John 1:4, 16-17). For such a gospel Paul was appointed an apostle, one who sets up and establishes the churches for God&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>Divine life was promised in the Old Testament, and this great promise of life is repeated and developed in the New Testament. Divine life is promised specifically in Habakkuk 2:4, which says, &ldquo;The righteous one will live by his faith.&rdquo; Here, to live means to have life and live. This word unveils God&rsquo;s eternal salvation given to sinners. Under God&rsquo;s judgment all sinners, whether Jews or Gentiles, are destined to die (Rom. 6:23). The unique way for sinners to escape God&rsquo;s judgment and obtain God&rsquo;s eternal salvation is to believe in God&rsquo;s embodiment, Christ, that they may become righteous and be justified in order to have life and live (John 3:16-18). God&rsquo;s eternal salvation is to save our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;for eternity (1 Thes. 5:23). The way for us to receive such a salvation is to believe in Christ so that we may be justified by God and thus be qualified to have the eternal, divine life and live by that life (Rom. 3:24; 5:1-2, 10, 17; Eph. 2:8). This is the New Testament gospel in an Old Testament prophetic book.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul quotes this word in Habakkuk three times in the New Testament (Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11; Heb. 10:38). In Romans 1:17 Paul says, &ldquo;The righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith, as it is written, &lsquo;But the righteous shall have life and live by faith.&rsquo;&rdquo; This verse reveals that the righteousness of God justifies us so that we may have God&rsquo;s life (5:18) and live by it. In this way this life will sanctify and transform us thoroughly. Romans covers mainly our being justified (1:1&mdash;5:11; 9:1&mdash;11:36), our having life (5:12&mdash;8:39), and our living properly by this life (12:1&mdash;16:27). In Galatians 3:11 Paul quotes Habakkuk 2:4, &ldquo;The righteous one shall have life and live by faith&rdquo;; in Hebrews 10:38 he also quotes the verse, &ldquo;My righteous one shall live by faith.&rdquo; These three verses, in which Paul quotes Habakkuk 2:4, stress our having life and our living by faith.</p>
<p>Second Timothy was written at a time when the churches established through the apostle&rsquo;s ministry in the Gentile world were in a trend of degradation and the apostle himself was confined in a remote prison. Many had turned away from him and forsaken him (1:15; 4:16), including even some of his co-workers (v. 10). It was a discouraging and disappointing scene, especially to his young fellow worker and spiritual child, Timothy. Because of this, in the opening of this encouraging, strengthening, and establishing Epistle, he confirmed to Timothy that he was an apostle of Christ not only through the will of God but also according to the promise of life, which is in Christ. This implies that though the churches may become degraded and many of the saints may backslide in unfaithfulness, the eternal life, the divine life, the uncreated life of God, promised by God in His holy writings and given to the apostle and all the believers, remains forever the same. With and upon this unchanging life the firm foundation of God was laid and stands unshaken through all the tide of degradation (2:19). By such a life those who seek the Lord out of a pure heart are able to stand the test of the church&rsquo;s decline. This life, which the apostle in 1 Timothy charged Timothy and others to lay hold on (6:12, 19), must have been an encouragement and strengthening to the apostle in perilous times.</p>
<p>When Paul was writing this Epistle, he was fully aware that the churches were declining. However, because he was one who laid hold on the promise of eternal life, he was not discouraged or disappointed. He had something within him which never changed&mdash;the eternal, uncreated, incorruptible life of God. No matter how the environment may change, this eternal life remains the same. Thus, he himself was encouraged in the life of God and not disappointed by the situation, because he laid hold on the eternal life promised by God in His holy writings. The life promised by God in the Scriptures dwelt within Paul.</p>
<p>The eternal life according to which Paul became an apostle is incorruptible and unchanging, for this life is actually the processed Triune God Himself. Because this life dwelt in Paul, not even the whole Roman Empire was able to prevail over him in its dealings with him. Paul was strengthened by the processed Triune God as life. Whatever we do and whatever we are must be according to the eternal life and by this life.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(71)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">88. The Sphere and Element of Grace</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2 Christ is presented as the sphere and element of grace. This passage reveals that Christ is the seed of David, raised from the dead (v. 8) for the salvation of God&rsquo;s chosen people with eternal glory (v. 10), and that Paul, His servant, was empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Seed of David Raised from the Dead</h2>
<p>In verse 8 Paul says, &ldquo;Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel.&rdquo; The word <em>raised</em> indicates Christ&rsquo;s victory over death by His divine life with its resurrection power. The expression <em>seed of David</em> indicates Christ&rsquo;s dignified human nature, which was exalted and glorified along with His divine nature. The words <em>my gospel</em> indicate that the apostle&rsquo;s gospel is the glad tidings of the living person, Christ, who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature, who was incarnated to be the Son of Man and resurrected to be the Son of God, as related in the parallel portion, Romans 1:1-4.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. For the Salvation of God&rsquo;s Chosen People<br />
with Eternal Glory</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2:10 Paul continues, &ldquo;Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the chosen ones, that they themselves also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.&rdquo; <em>The chosen ones</em> denotes the believers in Christ, who were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4) and selected from among mankind for salvation. The apostle endured all sufferings for the sake of us, the chosen ones, that we too may obtain salvation, as he did.</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2:10 Paul does not speak of salvation <em>and</em> eternal glory but of salvation <em>with</em> eternal glory. Eternal glory is the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s salvation (Rom. 8:21); God&rsquo;s salvation leads us into His glory (Heb. 2:10). This encourages us to endure sufferings for the gospel (Rom. 8:17).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. In This Grace<br />
His Servant Being Empowered</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2:1 Paul says to Timothy, &ldquo;Be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This verse indicates that Christ is the sphere and element of grace. While the church was degrading, Timothy was empowered to stand against that degradation. He could do this by the grace which is in Christ Jesus. God&rsquo;s grace is powerful, enabling us to bear anything. This empowering grace will make us living and strong. We should be strong in the power of the Lord&rsquo;s grace for God&rsquo;s economy. Whereas 2 Timothy 1:1 reveals that the promised life constituted Paul an apostle, 2:1 unveils that grace empowered Timothy. These two verses show that we may serve God not only by the constituting of the promised life but also by the empowering of grace.</p>
<p>Today we need to be empowered in the grace, which is the processed Triune God dispensed into us for our enjoyment, so that we may commit the healthy words that we have experienced to faithful men, who will be competent to teach the same healthy words to others also (v. 2). We are to be empowered in this grace not to do miracles but to commit the healthy words that we have enjoyed to faithful men to produce many competent teachers, whose speaking will inoculate the church against the decline. Being empowered in the grace will issue in our becoming a teacher (v. 2), a soldier (v. 3), a contender (v. 5), a farmer (v. 6), a workman to cut straight the word of God (v. 15), and a vessel unto honor (v. 21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">89. The Deliverer of the Believers<br />
from Persecutions</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 3:11-12 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the deliverer of the believers from persecutions.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.All Who Desire to Live Godly in Christ Jesus<br />
Being Destined to Be Persecuted</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 3:12 Paul says, &ldquo;Indeed all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;desire&rdquo; can also mean &ldquo;determine.&rdquo; To live godly is to live a life of godliness. All those who desire, determine, to live a life of godliness in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. For this reason we should not expect good treatment from today&rsquo;s religion. Instead, we should expect persecution for living a godly life in an ungodly situation. As long as we stand for God&rsquo;s economy, we will be condemned, opposed, and attacked. Rumors will be spread concerning us, and our names will be smeared and defiled. Such persecution comes mainly not from the worldly people but from so-called Christians. In John 16:2 the Lord Jesus said that the time is coming when those who kill the disciples will think that they are serving God. Out of their zeal for God, they will kill the followers of the Lord, simply because these ones do not follow the traditional way. If we desire to live godly in Christ Jesus, we should expect nothing but persecution.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Christ Delivering the Godly Believers<br />
from Persecutions</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 3:11 Paul says, &ldquo;Persecutions, sufferings, such as befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra. Such persecutions I bore, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.&rdquo; This verse indicates that Christ delivers the godly believers from all persecutions. Some may argue that since Paul was killed under persecution, Christ did not deliver him from all persecutions. Yet we need to see what Paul says in 2 Timothy 4:18: &ldquo;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will save me into His heavenly kingdom.&rdquo; It seems that throughout the past centuries the Lord did not always deliver His faithful saints, such as the apostles Paul and Peter, from persecution and martyrdom. However, we need to realize what will take place at the closing of this age. Caesar Nero who persecuted and killed Paul will be cast into the lake of fire, but the one he persecuted will be delivered into the heavenly kingdom. Although Paul was rejected by an earthly kingdom, he will be saved into the heavenly kingdom. Eventually, all the persecuted and martyred believers will be delivered by the resurrection power of Christ into His heavenly kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head3">90. The One Who Is to Appear</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 4 Christ is unveiled as the One who is to appear.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Judging the Living and the Dead</h2>
<p>In 4:1 Paul says to Timothy, &ldquo;I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead.&rdquo; God has given all judgment to Christ because He is a man (John 5:22, 27; Acts 10:42; 17:31; Rom. 2:16). As the righteous Judge (2 Tim. 4:8), Christ will judge the living on His throne of glory at His second appearing (Matt. 25:31-46), and He will judge the dead on the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b.His Appearing and His KingdomBeing<br />
the Incentive to His Servant</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 4:1 Paul solemnly charges Timothy by Christ&rsquo;s appearing and His kingdom. This indicates that, in his life and work, Paul took the Lord&rsquo;s appearing and His kingdom as the incentive and goal. The Lord&rsquo;s appearing will be for judgment, to reward each one of us (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12), and His kingdom will be for His reigning with His overcomers (Rev. 20:4, 6). The apostle not only took these two matters as the incentive and goal for himself but also by these two matters charged Timothy, who was under his leading, to faithfully fulfill his ministry of the word (2 Tim. 4:1-2, 5).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s appearing and the matter of judgment are seen in the parable of the slothful slave in Matthew 25. The kingdom involves reward or punishment according to what we have been and what we have done since the time that we were saved until the time that He comes back. In 2 Timothy 4:8 Paul says that he will be awarded with the crown of righteousness by the Lord, the righteous Judge. Paul seriously warns and charges Timothy, not by love nor by kindness, but by the Lord&rsquo;s appearing and by His kingdom. We will be either rewarded or punished righteously by the righteous Judge at His appearing.</p>
<p>Because the Lord&rsquo;s coming and His kingdom are solemn matters, Paul gives a serious charge to Timothy in 4:1-8. We should not think that the Lord&rsquo;s appearing will merely be a time of rapture and excitement. It will also be a time of great solemnity for every believer in Christ. This is the reason Paul charges Timothy by the Lord&rsquo;s appearing and His kingdom. May we all give heed to this solemn warning.</p>
<p>According to Paul&rsquo;s charge in verse 1, Timothy was to live in the light of the appearing of the Lord and His kingdom. Whatever the kingdom will reject in the future must be rejected in our living today. If we live in His appearing, we would certainly refrain from quarreling; we would not want to be found arguing when the Lord appears. Not many Christians regard the Lord&rsquo;s coming as a warning. If we read the New Testament, especially the Epistles, we will see that the apostles lived with the appearing of the Lord in view. The Lord&rsquo;s appearing was constantly a warning to them and regulated their living. They did not dare to do certain things because they believed that the Lord could appear at any time. If we take seriously the matters of the Lord&rsquo;s appearing and the kingdom, they will greatly affect our daily living. The appearing of Christ must be a basic factor in our daily living. We must live today in the light of the Lord&rsquo;s appearing.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c.As the Righteous Judge,<br />
Awarding the Crown of Righteousness to His Servant and All Those Who Have Loved His Appearing</h2>
<p> In verse 8 Paul continues, &ldquo;Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, with which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me in that day, and not only me but also all those who have loved His appearing.&rdquo; The crown, a symbol of glory, is given as a prize, in addition to the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race (1 Cor. 9:25). In contrast to salvation, which is of grace and by faith (Eph. 2:5, 8-9), this prize is not of grace nor by faith, but is of righteousness through works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 2 Cor. 5:10). The believers will be recompensed with such a reward, not according to the Lord&rsquo;s grace but according to His righteousness. Hence, it is the crown of righteousness. The Recompenser is the Lord as the righteous Judge. Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved for him and that he would be recompensed with it at the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second appearing.</p>
<p>Here it is not a matter of a crown of grace but of a crown of righteousness. The crown of righteousness is the crown to be a king. This means when the Lord comes back, Paul will be rewarded with the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>Paul says that such an award will be given to all who love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. The Lord&rsquo;s appearing, His coming back, is a warning, an encouragement, and an incentive to us. We should love it and look forward to it with earnest expectation and joy.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of talk among Christians today concerning the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. But not many believers realize that when the Lord Jesus comes back, He will not come as the merciful God or as the gracious Savior but as the righteous Judge. Christians should be warned and encouraged to prepare themselves to stand before this Judge. We should take up the burden in this dark age to bring such a solemn charge to the Lord&rsquo;s people. We all need to receive this charge before God and before the Lord Jesus, the One who will judge the living and the dead. We must declare the fact that when the Lord comes back, He will be the Judge of all, both believers and unbelievers. According to Matthew 25, all of the Lord&rsquo;s servants will have to give an account to Him. The Lord will either say, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave&rdquo; (v. 21), or &ldquo;Evil and slothful slave&rdquo; (v. 26). In His righteousness the Lord will decide whether or not we receive a reward.</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 4:10 Paul says, &ldquo;Demas has abandoned me, having loved the present age.&rdquo; Loving the present age, the world now before our eyes, is in contrast to loving the Lord&rsquo;s appearing, mentioned in verse 8. The world, the cosmos, is composed of many ages. It seems that every decade is a different age. The present age is the world which surrounds us, attracts us, and tempts us. Demas was one who loved the present age. Because of the attraction of the present age, Demas abandoned the apostle.</p>
<p>In verses 8 and 10 we have a contrast between loving the Lord&rsquo;s appearing and loving the present age. If we love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing, we will side with Him and fight with Him for His interests. But if we love the present age, we will side with the world. We must tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You and I love Your appearing. Because I love You, I love Your appearing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">d.Delivering His Servant<br />
from Every Evil Work and Saving Him<br />
into His Eternal Kingdom</h2>
<p>In verse 18 Paul declares, &ldquo;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will save me into His heavenly kingdom, to whom be the glory forever and ever.&rdquo; Every evil work here refers mainly to man&rsquo;s persecution, which usually comes from Satan&rsquo;s evilness (Matt. 6:13). Paul suffered a great deal of persecution, yet he was confident that the Lord would deliver him from every evil work.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s being delivered from every evil work included even his final martyrdom. Since martyrdom ushered Paul into the heavenly kingdom, such an ushering was a deliverance to him. There is no other time that the Lord dispenses Himself in so great a measure into the believers as in the time of their suffering of martyrdom. Whenever the believers suffer persecution, encounter afflictions, and even suffer martyrdom because of their loving the Lord, the Lord infuses and dispenses all His riches into them so that they may be strengthened to overcome and be delivered from every evil work. Such a deliverance is what we believers should believe in, hope for, and experience, and it is also what the Lord is pleased to give us.</p>
<p>The heavenly kingdom is &ldquo;the kingdom of their Father&rdquo; (13:43), &ldquo;the kingdom of My Father&rdquo; (26:29), &ldquo;the kingdom of Christ and of God&rdquo; (Eph. 5:5), and &ldquo;the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:11), which will be a reward to the overcoming saints. It equals the crown of righteousness in 2 Timothy 4:8 and is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly race. The apostle Paul&rsquo;s word in verse 18 and in verse 8 proves that this reward was an incentive to him. Paul had the assurance to make the triumphant declaration that he would be saved into this heavenly kingdom.</p>
<p>When Paul made this declaration that he expected to enter into the kingdom, he was being rejected by all the churches in Asia (1:15). Nevertheless, he knew that although he was rejected by earthly men, God would save him into His kingdom, because he had given up the world to gain Christ.</p>
<p>Paul knew that he would be martyred by the earthly kingdom, the earthly Roman Empire, and that he would be rejected, killed, and cut off from the earthly kingdom. Yet he also had the assurance that the Lord would deliver him into a heavenly empire, the heavenly kingdom. Therefore, he suffered martyrdom with no miraculous rescue. In Paul there was no thought of something miraculous, but instead, his thought was full of the spiritual, divine reality. As followers of the Lord Jesus, we should not expect the Lord to do something miraculous for us. But we have the full right to claim that the Lord must do spiritual, divine, and heavenly things for us.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(72)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">91. Our Great God and Savior</h2>
<p>In Titus 2:13-14 Christ is revealed as our great God and Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.Giving Himself for Us<br />
That He Might Redeem Usfrom All Lawlessness<br />
and Purify to Himself a Particular People<br />
as His Unique Possession,<br />
Zealous of Good Works</h2>
<p>In verse 14 Paul says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a particular people as His unique possession, zealous of good works.&rdquo; The words <em>for us</em> here mean &ldquo;on our behalf&rdquo;; they do not mean &ldquo;instead of us.&rdquo; To redeem means to buy with a price (1 Cor. 6:20; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; 1 Tim. 2:6). Christ gave Himself for us not only that He might redeem us from all lawlessness but also purify to Himself a particular people for His unique possession. A people for His possession are a peculiar people. This expression is borrowed from the Old Testament (Deut. 7:6; 14:2; 26:18) and denotes a people possessed by God as His unique, peculiar treasure (Exo. 19:5), His own possession (1 Pet. 2:9).</p>
<p><em>A particular people</em> is a special term in the New Testament. We should be particular not only in the inner life but also in our church practice. We should not follow the system of the world, and we should not make the practice of the church life a common thing that fits our human concept. Both our Christian walk and our practice of the church must be particular.</p>
<p>To be particular is to be different from the common way. Because we are a particular people living on the earth, our walk, our worship, and our service to God must not be common, according to the common system, or on the common course. Of course, there is no need to be purposely peculiar, but if we go on not according to the traditional teachings but according to the Lord&rsquo;s inner, living guidance, we will automatically be different from the common, worldly system. No matter how good the worldly system may seem to be, it is still according to the course of this age, and therefore it is no doubt of Satan. Our walk and our church practice, however, must be out from God. God must be the source, the nature, and the origin of our particular walk, life, and practice. Whatever we have must be something of God, absolutely different from the worldly system and contrary to the course of this age. The worldly system and the course of the age are of the devil (1 John 5:19), but we are following the inner leading of the Lord; therefore, we are spontaneously different.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Appearing in Glory</h2>
<p>In Titus 2:13 Paul speaks of the &ldquo;appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The glory of our great God is the glory of the Father (Matt. 16:27), which has been given to the Son (John 17:24) and into which we, as the many sons of God, will be brought (Heb. 2:10). By His wisdom God ordained us before the ages unto this glory (1 Cor. 2:7), and the God of all grace called us and saved us into this eternal glory (1 Pet. 5:10; 2 Tim. 2:10). The weight of this glory is exceedingly surpassing and eternal (2 Cor. 4:17), and with this glory we will be glorified (Rom. 8:17, 30). The appearing of this glory of Christ, our great God and Savior, is the blessed hope that we are awaiting.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. His Appearing Being the Blessed Hope<br />
That We Are Awaiting</h2>
<p>In Titus 2:13 Paul says to Timothy, &ldquo;Awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; According to this verse, the blessed hope is the appearing of Christ in His glory. The appearing of Christ will bring us into full sonship, that is, the redemption of our body, that we may enjoy the freedom of the glory of the children of God, for which we were saved (Rom. 8:21-25). This is the hope of eternal life (Titus 1:2), a hope of eternal blessing, a blessed hope in the eternal life of the Triune God, based on which Paul became an apostle.</p>
<p>Paul also speaks of &ldquo;our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Through the centuries there have been two schools of interpretation regarding this remarkable, marvelous, and excellent sacred and divine title: (1) that two persons are indicated, God and Christ; (2) that there is but one person, Jesus Christ being our great God and Savior, the deity of Christ thus being asserted. We prefer the second interpretation, with a comma after <em>Savior.</em> This corresponds with the two sacred titles revealed at the birth of Christ: Jesus&mdash;Jehovah the Savior&mdash;and Emmanuel&mdash;God with us (Matt. 1:21-23). Our Lord not only is our Savior but also is God, and not merely God but the great God, the God who is great in nature, in glory, in authority, in power, in deed, in love, in grace, and in every divine attribute. In 1 Timothy 2:5 our Lord is revealed as a man; in Titus 2:13, as the great God. He is both man and God. His appearing in His divine glory will be not only for saving His people into His eternal kingdom, but also for bringing them into God&rsquo;s eternal glory (Heb. 2:10; 1 Pet. 5:10). Hence, His appearing in His glory is our blessed hope.</p><h2 class="head3">92. The Means of the Pouring Out<br />
of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>In Titus 3:5-7 we see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the means of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Through Him God Pouring Out<br />
the Holy Spirit on Us Richly</h2>
<p>Verse 6 says that God poured out the Holy Spirit &ldquo;upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit, who is the Triune God reaching man, has been not only given to us but poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, to impart to us all the divine riches in Christ, including God&rsquo;s eternal life and His divine nature, as an eternal portion for us to enjoy.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b.To Save Us through the Washing of Regeneration<br />
and Renewing of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>In verse 5 Paul says, &ldquo;Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; <em>Works in righteousness</em> refer to works of righteousness done in the element and sphere of righteousness, denoting genuine works of righteousness. Even such genuine works of righteousness are not sufficient to be the basis and condition of our salvation. Only the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit, brought to us by God&rsquo;s mercy, are sufficient to cause us to be saved.</p>
<p>The Greek word for <em>regeneration</em> here is different from that for <em>regenerated</em> in 1 Peter 1:23. The only other place the word is used is Matthew 19:28, where it is used for the restoration in the millennium. Here it refers to a change from one state to another. Being born again is the commencing of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God&rsquo;s new creation, a process that makes us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling, with life. Baptism (Rom. 6:3-5), the putting off of the old man, the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22, 24; Col. 3:9-11), and transformation by the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) are all related to this wonderful process. The washing of regeneration purges away all the things of the old nature of our old man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts something new&mdash;the divine essence of the new man&mdash;into our being. In this is a passing from our old state into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation. Hence, both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are working in us continually throughout our life until the completion of the new creation.</p>
<p>Regeneration is a washing in God&rsquo;s salvation. This washing is a great renewing of the believers by God&rsquo;s salvation to enable them to eliminate all that is of their natural life and the old creation and to become God&rsquo;s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). The washing of regeneration begins with our regeneration and continues with the renewing of the Spirit, both of which are the aspects of the organic salvation and are matters of life. In the washing of regeneration there is the renewing of the Holy Spirit. Following the washing of regeneration, the Holy Spirit continues to work within us to recreate us that we may become a new creation, thus renewing us.</p>
<p>We need not only the judicial washing by the Lord&rsquo;s redeeming blood to cleanse us from every sin (Heb. 1:3; 1 John 1:7) but also the organic washing, the washing of regeneration, which begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit. We receive an organic washing by daily experiencing God&rsquo;s organic salvation. The washing of regeneration washes away the old elements, the old nature, and the old things that are within us; the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts new elements, a new essence, and new things into us. Both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are working in us continually throughout our life until the completion of the new creation so that we may be built up in God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p>
<p>Such a washing, such a renewing, in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is being carried out continually in us by the renewing Spirit spreading into our mind, by our walking in newness of the divine life, and by our being consumed by the environmental sufferings. The renewing in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is by the renewing Spirit mingling with our regenerated spirit as one spirit to spread into our mind (Eph. 4:22-24) and infuse our inward parts with God&rsquo;s attributes, which are forever new and never become old, thereby renewing our entire being (5:26-27; Rom. 12:2a). Our God is newness itself. In the entire universe, God alone is new and everything else is old. This God, who is forever new and who never becomes old, infuses His ever-new essence into us to renew our entire being.</p>
<p>The renewing in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is also by our walking in the newness of the divine life in the resurrection of Christ (Rom. 6:4). In order to walk in newness of life, we need, on the one hand, to put off the old man, and on the other hand, to put on the new man (Eph. 4:22, 24). To put off the old man is to deny and renounce our old self and to apply the cross to the self. Furthermore, we need to put on the new man, that is, to apply what Christ has accomplished in creating the new man, by living and magnifying Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19-21). This is what it means to walk in newness of life. All these matters are for the renewing Spirit to renew us by imparting the new essence and new element into us that we may be renewed day by day.</p>
<p>The renewing in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is also by our being consumed by the environmental sufferings for the killing of our outer man and the renewing of our inner man day by day (2 Cor. 4:16). God&rsquo;s renewing us is accomplished through the consuming by the outward environmental sufferings. Our sufferings are for us to be renewed. Although our outer man is decaying, our inner man is being renewed day by day. In order to renew us, God has arranged all kinds of environments to come to us for a positive purpose, that is, to dispense God&rsquo;s new essence and new element into us. We should have such a daily subjective experience of our outer man decaying and our inner man being renewed day by day. Through such a renewing we are built up in God&rsquo;s organic salvation to ultimately become as new as the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). We are in the process of being renewed day by day with the divine element by the renewing of the Holy Spirit through sufferings to become the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy the church is stressed (3:15-16), in 2 Timothy the Scripture (3:15-16), and in Titus the Holy Spirit. The church is the house of the living God, expressing God in the flesh, and is the pillar and base of the truth, the divine reality of the great mystery&mdash;God manifested in the flesh. The Scripture is the breath of God, containing and conveying His divine essence for our nourishing and equipping to make us perfect and complete for His use. The Holy Spirit is the divine person, washing and renewing us in the divine element to make us a new creation with the divine nature, that we might be heirs of God in His eternal life, inheriting all the riches of the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head4">c.In Order That Having Been Justified by His Grace,We Might Become Heirs<br />
according to the Hope of Eternal Life</h2>
<p>In 3:7 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;In order that having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&rdquo; This verse speaks forth the issue and goal of God&rsquo;s salvation (v. 5) and justification (v. 7), which include the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit (vv. 5-6). This issue and goal are to make us heirs of God according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p>According to verse 7, the believers are not merely sons but heirs who are qualified to inherit the Father&rsquo;s estate (Rom. 4:14; 8:17; Gal. 3:29; 4:7). Such heirs are born (John 1:12-13) of God&rsquo;s eternal life (3:16). This eternal life enables them not only to live and enjoy God in this age but also to inherit in the coming age and in eternity all the riches of what God is to them. Hence, there is the hope of eternal life. God&rsquo;s eternal life is our enjoyment today and our hope for tomorrow. According to this hope, we become heirs of God to inherit all His riches for eternity. This is the climax, the eternal goal, of His eternal salvation with His eternal life, which has been given to us by grace in Christ.</p>
<p>Today we are experiencing and enjoying the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. Moreover, we have the hope of the eternal life to inherit all the riches of God. The riches of God are not merely what we will inherit in the distant future; they should be our present enjoyment. We can enjoy a foretaste of God Himself as our inheritance today because we have the eternal life. Our present enjoyment of this eternal life is a foretaste of God Himself as our eternal inheritance.</p>
<p>Today we should enjoy this foretaste of God as our inheritance; we will then enjoy the full taste of this inheritance in the millennial age and in eternity. Yet if we believers do not enjoy the foretaste of what we will inherit of God, we will miss the full taste in the coming age of the millennium.</p>
<p>In summary, through Christ God poured out the Holy Spirit on us richly to save us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit. The basic concept of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to make us a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17), and the way God makes us a new creation is to work Himself into our being by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. Regeneration involves a change by life, with life, and in life and brings in a washing by the divine life as the washing water. The divine life which comes into our spirit to enliven our deadened spirit washes away the dead elements; regeneration washes away the old creation with sin, Satan, the world, and the flesh. The renewing of the Holy Spirit is the continuation of the washing of the regeneration in our spirit. Through regeneration our spirit was renewed, but our soul was not renewed by regeneration. Thus, after regeneration the Spirit continues to renew us by saturating our soul. The renewing of the Holy Spirit is the work of the Spirit to transform us into the image of Christ from glory to glory (3:18). The Spirit renews us in every aspect of our daily living. By this renewing we are gradually being transformed from one degree of glory to another unto glorification. Transformation, that is, renewing, is the way to enter into glorification, in which we will be heirs. At our regeneration we were born children of God by receiving eternal life; this eternal life that we are enjoying brings in a hope to inherit God Himself as the divine inheritance (Rom. 8:14, 17). Through the long process of being renewed unto glorification, we will be heirs to inherit what God promised as a reward in the coming kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head3">93. The Sphere and Element for the Refreshing<br />
of the Believers&rsquo; Inward Parts</h2>
<p>In Philemon 20 Christ is unveiled as the sphere and element for the refreshing of the believers&rsquo; inward parts.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.In Him We Being Refreshed in Our Inward Parts<br />
by the Fellow Believers</h2>
<p>Paul asks Philemon to refresh his inward parts in Christ. The word <em>refresh</em> means &ldquo;soothe or cheer.&rdquo; Literally, the Greek word rendered &ldquo;inward parts&rdquo; means &ldquo;bowels,&rdquo; as in verse 7. Since Philemon had refreshed the inward parts of the saints, Paul now asked him to do the same for him in the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. This Being a Profit in the Lord</h2>
<p>In verse 20 Paul says, &ldquo;Brother, may I have profit from you in the Lord; refresh my inward parts in Christ.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>profit</em> here is <em>onaimen,</em> which is similar in sound to Onesimus (both words meaning &ldquo;profitable&rdquo;). Here, this word is an allusion to the name Onesimus. This is a play on words, implying that &ldquo;since you owe me even your own self, you are an Onesimus to me&mdash;hence, you should be profitable to me; that is, you should let me have profit from you in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Onesimus was Philemon&rsquo;s purchased bondslave who ran away from his master. While he was in prison at Rome with Paul, he was saved through the apostle. Now the apostle sent him back to his master. In verse 20 Paul indicates that since he sent Onesimus&mdash;whose name means &ldquo;profitable&rdquo;&mdash;back to Philemon, in return Philemon now should be a profit to Paul in the Lord. According to verse 20, the profit in the Lord that Paul speaks of refers to being refreshed in his inward parts in Christ Jesus. Since the imprisoned apostle was suffering under persecution, he needed Philemon, a fellow believer, to refresh his inward parts. Yet refreshing Paul&rsquo;s inward parts cannot be done in or by Philemon himself but in the Lord and in Christ. The profit&mdash;being refreshed in his inward parts&mdash;that Paul sought from Philemon comes out of the Lord. It is only in Christ that we can be refreshed in our inward parts by the fellow believers. This is to enjoy Christ as the sphere and element for the refreshing of the believers&rsquo; inward parts.</p></body></html>
