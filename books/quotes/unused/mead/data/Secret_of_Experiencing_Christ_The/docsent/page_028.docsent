   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REGENERATING THE BELIEVERS IN THEIR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the life-giving Spirit, Christ has regenerated the believers in their spirit John 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Doctrinally, it is difficult to explain how Christ, after entering into us, regenerates us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, in experience it is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a sinner repents, confesses his sins, believes in the Lord Jesus, and calls on His name, at that very moment Christ as the life-giving Spirit enters into his spirit to enliven his dead spirit, that is, to regenerate him in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Immediately such a person becomes alive, happy, and joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He cannot explain what has happened to him, but he is rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He may continue to repent of his sins for the remainder of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A great change has taken place in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This sinner has been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has been regenerated, and he is now a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe that many of us have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is what it means to be saved, to be regenerated, and to be converted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE BELIEVERS BEING BROUGHT INTO</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>AN ORGANIC UNION WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through their believing in Christ and their being baptized into Christ, the believers have been brought into an organic union with Christ John 3:15, 36a; Rom 6:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we believed in Christ and were baptized into Him, an organic union took place in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This organic union which took place at our believing in Jesus has united us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, this union has grafted us into Christ, who is the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is by such a transaction that we have been made branches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hallelujah, we are believers in Christ, and we are branches grafted into this wonderful, universal vine tree!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE BELIEVERS' REGENERATED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND CHRIST AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>JOINED TO BE ONE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The believers' regenerated spirit and Christ who is the life-giving Spirit are joined to be one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We, the believers in Christ, all have a regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our spirit was dead, but through believing in Christ it has been made alive Eph 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we all have within us our own spirit which has been regenerated and made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the same time Christ as the life-giving Spirit is within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These two spirits are joined to be one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a most mysterious and wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Most Christians today have no concept of this mysterious and wonderful reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in the Lord's recovery this is stressed day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That our spirit is joined to Christ, the life-giving Spirit, as one spirit is a most crucial and vital matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the ultimate consummation of the organic union which we have with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No union could be more intimate than this union.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The realization that we are one spirit with Christ will cause us to be beside ourselves with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such a realization may cause us to shout, "Hallelujah, we are one spirit with the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many times I have been asked how I, as an elderly man, could be so active and so energetic.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My secret is that I am one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today, many toys are made to operate by electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is electricity which makes them so active.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because we are one spirit with Christ, we have the heavenly, divine electricity energizing us continually.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How we need to realize our organic union with Christ and live in this reality!</S>
