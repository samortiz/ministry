        <h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE IN EVERY STAGE BEING CHRIST<br />
AND HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Although there are six stages of spiritual experience in Song of Songs, a seeker does not experience one thing in the first stage, another thing in the second stage, and yet another thing in the third stage, and so forth. Rather, the seeker has every spiritual experience in the first stage, but she does not experience them in their full measure. In principle, her experiences in the second stage are the same as her experiences in the first stage; however, the degree of the fullness of her experience has increased. In the third stage she experiences the same things that she did in the previous stages, but the measure of these experiences has increased. This continues through the fourth, fifth, and the sixth stages. In principle, in each stage she has the same experiences that she had in the first stage. Although the seeker does not experience anything new in the different stages, the experiences are new, and the measure of the experience is increased.</p>
<p>In our spiritual pursuit we do not experience different things in different stages. In the past we clearly demarcated the four stages of our spiritual life (see <em>The Experience of Life</em>). However, in our experience the stages are not clearly defined, because our experiences in the first stage include most of what we will experience later. Our future experiences do not differ from our initial experiences; our experiences will only become deeper, higher, stronger, and richer. This can be compared to dyeing a piece of cloth. In the beginning of the dyeing process, the color of the cloth is light, but the color deepens with each application until it reaches its deepest hue. Our spiritual experience is similar to this.</p>
<p>In terms of revelation, in every stage we experience Christ. In terms of application, we experience His death and resurrection. Hence, all our spiritual experiences are of Christ and His death and resurrection. Even a new believer experiences Christ and His death and resurrection. A person believes and is baptized because he knows Christ and has experienced His death, burial, and resurrection. This is our experience in the beginning of our Christian life, and we continue in this experience for the rest of our lives as we advance from stage to stage. According to Song of Songs, the Christ we know in the first stage is the same person we continue to know in the later stages, and the death and resurrection we experience in the first stage are the death and resurrection we will experience in the later stages. The only difference is that our experiences will gradually become deeper and richer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RENEWED FOR GENUINE SERVICE</h2>
<p>Our work and service should be according to the experience in Song of Songs. We should not do a habitual work that merely maintains the status quo. This is the condition in Christianity where a pastor is hired to give a sermon every Lord&rsquo;s Day. The sermons might be delivered in a good way, and the congregation might understand and remember what is spoken, but this understanding and remembering do not have any effect on the hearers. The sermons produce an increase in Bible knowledge but do not cause the hearers to rise up to pursue and experience the Lord. This is a habitual work that maintains the status quo. There is no light or experience in this work. We should not maintain such a religious situation in the churches. We should not do a work that seemingly touches people but does not change them. Rather, our work should always help people either in the beginning, during the course, or in the ending of a stage of their spiritual pursuit. We must always lead people to experience and pursue the Lord. Those who have not consecrated themselves should be brought to consecration. Those who have not experienced dealings should be brought into receiving the dealings. Those who have consecrated in the past but are presently in a low situation should be helped to renew their consecration. Those who have had dealings in the past but have lost their freshness should be helped to have fresh dealings with the Lord. Those who had spiritual experiences in the past but have become dull and dry and lack light and strength should be helped to rise up to seek the Lord again. If we are continually renewed, the old things will become new, and our service will be genuine, not habitual.</p>
<p>As those who serve the Lord, we continually contact people whether by giving messages or by visiting them. Hence, we need to do a work of renewing, and we need to be renewed. We should not think that we are doing well because we are not sinful or fleshly, have proper conduct, read the Bible, are touched by the Lord, and pray. These maintain our spiritual condition, but because they will not cause us to progress, the work and the church will become old. Even if we do not have other problems, oldness is a problem. Only by having a new beginning with a new consecration and new dealings will our work be fresh, and the church will experience another stage of the Lord&rsquo;s fresh presence.</p>
<p>The seeker in Song of Songs rises up to seek her beloved even at night. She says, &ldquo;On my bed night after night / I sought him whom my soul loves; / I sought him, but found him not. / I will rise now and go about in the city; / In the streets and in the squares / I will seek him whom my soul loves&rdquo; (3:1-2). We need to seek the Lord; we should not be indifferent. The sense of being low and of losing the Lord&rsquo;s presence should serve as a green light that urges us to rise up and move forward. We must seek the Lord, have dealings with Him, and have a new consecration according to our inner feeling.</p>
<p>When we rise up to seek the Lord, we will spontaneously cause others to seek the Lord together with us. The beginning of our seeking the Lord has two aspects. Either the Lord draws us, or our sense of thirst and hunger causes us to pursue Him. When we experience the Lord&rsquo;s abundance, we will rise up, just as the seeker in Song of Songs did, and say, &ldquo;I feast with the Lord at His table and enjoy His abundance. I delight and sit down in His shade, and His fruit is sweet to my taste&rdquo; (cf. 1:12; 2:3). Such a testimony will produce a hunger and longing in those who hear us, and they will be willing to seek the Lord in order to gain the same experience. Perhaps our experience is not full, and we have a sense of dissatisfaction in our heart. As this sense of dissatisfaction grows stronger, we will desperately long for the Lord. When we speak with others concerning our dissatisfaction, there will be an echo within them, and they will sense a hunger and thirst for the Lord. Hence, as long as we seek the Lord, whether we are feasting with Him or are hungry and thirsty for Him, we will affect others and cause them to hunger. As a result, they will also rise up to seek the Lord.</p>
<p>We all need to bring this word before the Lord in prayer. We do not need to look at others; rather, we need to see our condition. Do we need to be renewed and revived to have a new consecration and new dealings with the Lord? If the Lord has mercy on us, He will appear to us and draw us to rise up and seek Him, or He will cause us to feel hungry and dissatisfied, which will force us to rise up and seek Him. Then we will be revived, and everything related to us will become new. The Bible we read will be new, the hymns we sing will be new, and even the spiritual books we read will be new. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, may we all have such a new revival.</p>

 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
