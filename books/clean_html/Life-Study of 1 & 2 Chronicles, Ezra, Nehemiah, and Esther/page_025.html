<h2 class="head1">VII. OF AMAZIAH</h2>
<p>In 25:5-16 we have the example of Amaziah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Preparing Three Hundred Thousand<br />
Chosen Men for War</h2>
<p>Amaziah prepared three hundred thousand chosen men for war and hired from Israel one hundred thousand mighty men of valor to fight against the Edomites (vv. 5-6).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Man of God Advising Amaziah<br />
Not to Fight with the Help of the Army of Israel</h2>
<p>A man of God advised Amaziah not to fight with the help of the army of Israel, because God was not with Israel. Then he let the army of Israel go back to their own place, and their anger was greatly kindled against Judah (vv. 7-10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Strengthening Himself<br />
to Fight the Children of Edom</h2>
<p>Amaziah strengthened himself to fight the children of Edom with his own people and defeated them, capturing some of them (vv. 11-12). Here Amaziah had a clear standing and therefore was able to fight against Edom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Men of Israel Whom Amaziah Sent Back<br />
Raiding the Cities of Judah</h2>
<p>The men of Israel whom Amaziah had sent back from going with him into battle raided the cities of Judah, killed three thousand of them, and took much spoil (v. 13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Setting Up the Gods of the Edomites<br />
as His Gods for Worship</h2>
<p>After Amaziah defeated the Edomites, he brought their gods and set them up as his gods for worship. This was his great failure. The anger of Jehovah was kindled against him, and He sent a prophet to warn him. But he would not listen to the prophet, and God determined to destroy him (vv. 14-16).</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. OF UZZIAH (AZARIAH)</h2>
<p>Second Chronicles 26:6-21a speaks of the reign of Uzziah, whose other name is Azariah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Defeating the Philistines, the Arabians,<br />
and the Meunim by the Help of God</h2>
<p>Uzziah defeated the Philistines, the Arabians, and the Meunim by the help of God, and the Ammonites gave tribute to him. His fame went as far as Egypt. Thus he became exceedingly strong (vv. 6-8). This shows us that if we go along with the very God whom we worship, we will prosper. Otherwise, we will suffer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Building Towers in Jerusalem<br />
and Works of Defense</h2>
<p>Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem and works of defense and hewed out many cisterns for his ranch and farm. He had a mighty army and became strong by the marvelous help of God (vv. 9-15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. His Heart Becoming Uplifted<br />
to Trespass against Jehovah and Go into<br />
the Temple of Jehovah to Burn Incense</h2>
<p>When Uzziah became strong, his heart became uplifted to trespass against Jehovah and go into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense (v. 16). You may think that it was not wrong for the king to burn incense. But according to God&rsquo;s ordination in the Old Testament, the kings were not allowed to touch the duties of the priests. Burning the incense was the duty of the priests, not of the kings. Uzziah, however, was proud and did not care for anyone other than himself. Therefore, he went into the temple to do the service of a priest. Azariah the priest, with eighty priests of valor, withstood him to stop him from burning incense to God. Uzziah became angry with the priests, and leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests. Because of the uncleanness of his leprosy, the priests rushed him out of the temple of God and put him in a separate house as a leper until the day of his death (vv. 17-21a). Here in the case of Uzziah we have another example of a king who had a miserable end.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. OF AHAZ</h2>
<p>In 28:8-15 we have an account of the reign of Ahaz.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah Delivering Him<br />
into the Hand of the King of Israel</h2>
<p>When Jehovah delivered Ahaz into the hand of the king of Israel, the children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters, and also plundered much spoil from them (vv. 5b, 8).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Oded, a Prophet of Jehovah,<br />
Advising the Children of Israel<br />
to Return Their Captives from Judah</h2>
<p>Oded, a prophet of Jehovah, came to advise the children of Israel to return their captives from Judah, their brothers, for the burning anger of Jehovah was upon them (vv. 9-11). Oded seemed to be saying that after defeating Ahaz, they should not have captured so many women and young people. God is a God of love, and He would not approve of such a thing. Therefore, His anger was burning upon the people of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Heads of the Children of Ephraim<br />
Returning the Captives to Judah</h2>
<p>The heads of the children of Ephraim returned the captives to Judah in a kind and loving way so that they avoided the burning anger of Jehovah upon them (vv. 12-15).</p>
<p>The record in the books of Chronicles reveals that God is just in dealing with His people. Do not think that God will not take the time to deal with you if you are wrong in small things. God has much more time than you have. If you have time to make a mistake, He surely has time to discipline you.</p>
