        <h2 class="head2">Contacting God in Spirit</h2>
<p>Devotional prayer emphasizes introspection and petitioning, both of which mainly involve human effort. The prayer we are speaking of is not cultivated by human effort. This type of prayer does not involve introspection or petitions. Rather, it involves going before the Lord in order to contact Him. Instead of examining ourselves, we let the Lord shine on us and expose our weaknesses, mistakes, and shortcomings. Instead of petitioning the Lord, we allow Him to operate in us by transfusing and saturating us with Himself and by subduing, breaking, occupying, and gaining us. Such prayer is not a matter of petitioning but of receiving. We receive the Lord&rsquo;s transfusing, shining, and exposing. Furthermore, we allow the Lord to subdue, break, occupy, fill, and saturate us.</p>
<p>Such prayer does not require us to remain silent. We can still speak, but our words should come from the sense within. When we sense that the Lord desires to fill us, we can say, &ldquo;Lord, I am willing to let You fill my spirit and also my mind, emotion, and will.&rdquo; When we sense that our inward parts are not subdued by the Lord, we can say, &ldquo;Lord, my mind is not completely subdued by You; neither are my emotions and will subdued by You. Lord, subdue any part of my mind that I have reserved for myself, subdue any part of my emotion that has not turned to You, and subdue any part of my will that is independent of You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should spend an hour with the Lord and speak according to the sense in our spirit. There is no need to petition. We only receive. We receive the Lord&rsquo;s transfusing, filling, and occupying. Such prayer involves confessing our sins, prostrating ourselves before the Lord, surrendering, and entrusting ourselves to Him. This is mainly a matter of receiving, not of petitioning. The issue of such prayer is thanksgiving, praise, and worship. We will thank the Lord for His visitation, praise Him for His wonderful work, and worship Him for mingling with us and dwelling in us. This prayer is powerful because we enter into God, and He enters into us. Furthermore, we spontaneously contemplate the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness, glory, and virtues. As a result, our spirit is full of worship, and we utter words of praise. While we consider the Lord, our praise should not be hurried or drawn out.</p>
<p>Prayer for fellowship has an element of looking to the Lord. Although we sense that the Lord is mingling with us, we also sense that He is sitting on the throne. Hence, we desire that He would enter our living. Our looking to the Lord is our beholding Him.</p>
<p>Prayer for fellowship also involves waiting. We are not waiting for the Lord to do something; rather, we are waiting on the Lord by remaining in His presence to behold, worship, and praise Him. We should not be too quick to leave His presence but should rather remain in worship. This is like two intimate friends who are reluctant to part from each other. This was Abraham&rsquo;s experience in Genesis. While we wait on the Lord, we often receive further revelation from Him. Because Abraham remained before Jehovah, Jehovah said, &ldquo;Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?&rdquo; (18:17). This is the result of waiting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Setting Aside a Specific Time</h2>
<p>There is no need to hurry, because prayer for fellowship involves many details. The Lord often went up to the mountain to pray (Matt. 14:23; Mark 6:46; Luke 9:28). Sometimes He even spent the whole night in prayer to contact God, to absorb God, and to be filled with God (6:12). Satan always tries to interrupt this kind of prayer. He often sends people, matters, or things from the environment to disturb us while we are praying. Hence, we should leave every disturbance in order to contact God. Those who desire to be used by the Lord must learn this kind of prayer.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of praying in the morning or at night but of turning away from all people, matters, and things in order to contact God in spirit. While we wait on the Lord, we can utter words of praise in order to keep our mind from wandering. Sometimes our mind is not focused even when we worship or praise. We usually need to wait some time before our spirit can enter into God&rsquo;s presence. Then we can have deeper fellowship with God. It is often not possible to have such fellowship in our morning time or evening time with the Lord.</p>
<p>We should spend at least half an hour in order to enter into the spirit. We need between half an hour to an hour for such prayer. If we can spend an hour in prayer, we will learn this lesson. At the very least, we should spend half an hour in prayer. Our lack in the work is mainly because we have not learned this lesson. We must spend time to learn this lesson. Only then can we be truly useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. If we are willing to learn, after half a year we will know the cross, and we will know the meaning of being broken, being subdued, and being spiritual. We cannot rely on our companions in order to learn this lesson. We must learn it ourselves. Without this lesson, we have not received a truly spiritual education. Many spiritual lessons can be learned only through prayer, because all genuine lessons are learned in our fellowship with the Lord.</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
