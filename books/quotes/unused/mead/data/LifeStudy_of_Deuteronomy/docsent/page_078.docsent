   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Judgment on Kidnapping</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 24:7 we have the judgment on kidnapping.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a man kidnapped someone from among his brothers of the children of Israel and dealt with him as a slave or sold him, then that kidnapper was to be put to death v. 7a . This death sentence indicates the seriousness of kidnapping; it is equal in seriousness to the crime of murder.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To kidnap a person is equal to killing him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through the execution of the kidnapper, the evil was to be utterly removed from the midst of the children of Israel v. 7b .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Kidnapping is a serious sin that annuls one's human rights in a cheating way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not think that there cannot be any kind of kidnapping among brothers today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In recent years, certain ones have attempted to "kidnap" some of the brothers and to "enslave" them and then to "sell" them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These ones have not tried to kidnap the outsiders; they have tried to kidnap the brothers, the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kidnapping must be condemned.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fathers were not to be put to death because of their children, nor were the children to be put to death because of their fathers v. 16a . Rather, every man was to be put to death for his own sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 16 reveals God's justice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually all the points concerning the divine government among the children of Israel show us that God is a God of justice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a God of justice, God will not allow anything unjust to be among His people.</S>
