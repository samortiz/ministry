   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Today's situation is not much different from what happened in the past history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some free groups are just for the study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Others are for spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although these things are good, they are not God's goal and should not be an excuse to form divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Church history shows us that the so-called church in a general sense became degraded and that those who loved the Lord, who loved the truth, and who loved the Bible did not receive a proper, adequate, clear, and complete vision of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although they defended the truth, they made mistakes that resulted in more division in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, it was difficult for the Lord to find vessels to carry out His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the reason that the history of the church is generally a sad story.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not have the vision of God's goal, we will be happily content with many revivals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One of the most prevailing revivals in the history of the church took place in Wales in 1904 and 1905.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One story speaks of all the theaters in Wales being closed and of no one going to any worldly entertainment on Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of the people went to church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But it did not last too long.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was only a revival; not much was accomplished for the fulfilling of God's eternal purpose, that is, the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That revival was wonderful, but we also need to consider what was carried out through it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Revivals are very positive for bringing people to salvation, but there is not much result for the fulfilling of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to be clear what we are here for.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are not here merely to be separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not here merely to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are not here for revivals, mission work, or the study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are here for the Lord's recovery of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By His mercy, we have to defend the revealed truths in the Bible, but in our defending we should not make mistakes that will damage the Lord's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way to be kept from making any mistakes by our defending is to take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Surely we should not be worldly and surely we have to be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church should have no religion, no vain teachings, no philosophy, no human organization, no clergy, no hierarchy, no worldliness, no human power, and no flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we should not defend anything of God's kingdom by making serious mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order for us to be safeguarded from making any mistakes in defending something of God's interest, we need to see the church.</S>
