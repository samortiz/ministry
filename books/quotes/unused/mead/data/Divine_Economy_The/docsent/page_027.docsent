   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESURRECTION BEING LIFE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not many see that Christ's resurrection is a life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most Christians only see that the resurrection of Christ is Christ's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Death cannot hold Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He overcomes death, the tomb, and Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But it is hard to find a hymn that tells us that the resurrection of Christ is life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The resurrection of a grain of wheat is life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Life was only in Christ as the one grain, but after dying and resurrecting, His life was dispensed into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before the Lord died and resurrected, the divine life was only in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus was the only person who had the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The disciples were around Him, but they did not have the eternal life in them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Jesus had a way to dispense His divine life into Peter, John, James, Andrew, and all the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The way was for Him to die and to resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By resurrection the divine life in Jesus is dispensed into all of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before the death of Christ, Jesus was the only grain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the other disciples were not grains.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But He wanted all His disciples to become grains.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How could this be?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It could never be by teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 1:4 tells us that in Jesus was life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Life was in Him because He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Him was life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Outwardly Jesus and His disciples were the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the difference was this: in Jesus was life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Peter there was no life; in James there was no life; in John there was no life; in Andrew there was no life; and in all the other disciples there was no life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus was the only grain who had the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the unique grain of wheat He died and rose up to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By His rising up, the life within Him was dispensed into all of the disciples to make each one of them a grain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we can see what resurrection is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Resurrection is life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a new term that we should not forget Christ's resurrection is life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This life is the divine life, God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have seen that the Lord Jesus as the God-man died as the Lamb of God, a man in the flesh, the last Adam, the brass serpent, the Firstborn of all creation, and the Peacemaker.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord's death on the cross in these aspects was not for life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only His death on the cross as the grain of wheat was for life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a grain of wheat does not die, it remains one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if it dies, it will grow up to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus died on the cross not only to clear up all the negative things in the universe, but He died on the cross in a positive aspect to release His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, there are the redeeming aspect of the Lord's death and the life releasing aspect of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He was dying two substances came out of His pierced side: blood and water.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Blood is the sign of His redemption, and water is the sign of His life releasing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He died to accomplish redemption, and He died to release His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we have the redeeming blood and the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b signified by the water.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank the Lord for the blood and the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord's death leads to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He died to live.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before the Lord Jesus no man died to live.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is because no one had the divine life within him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When they died, that meant termination.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But Jesus had the divine life within Him, so His death was His release of that life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He died to live, and the release of His life produced many grains.</S>
