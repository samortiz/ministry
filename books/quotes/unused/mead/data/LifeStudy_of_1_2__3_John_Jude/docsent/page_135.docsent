   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THIRD JOHN MESSAGE ONE HOSPITALITY TO THE TRAVELING WORKERS Scripture Reading: 3 John 1-8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The subject of the Epistle of 3 John is encouragement to the fellow workers in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider 3 John 1-8.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 1 through 4 are the introduction, and verses 5 through 8 speak of hospitality to traveling workers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>INTRODUCTION Loving in Truth</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The beginning of 3 John is similar to that of 2 John.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 1 the apostle John says, The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Like Peter, John was an elder in the church at Jerusalem before its destruction in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to history, after returning from exile, John stayed in Ephesus to care for the churches in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Probably he was an elder in the church at Ephesus, where he wrote this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Epistle of 3 John is addressed to Gaius the beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not the Gaius of Macedonia Acts 19:29 , the Gaius of Derbe Acts 20:4 , nor the Gaius of Corinth 1 Cor 1:14; Rom 16:23 , but another with the name of Gaius, a name that was very common at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the contents of this Epistle, Gaius must have been an outstanding brother in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 1 John speaks of loving Gaius in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here truth denotes the revealed divine reality the Triune God dispensed into man in the Son Jesus Christ becoming man s genuineness and sincerity, to live a life that corresponds to the divine light John 3:19-21 and to worship God, as God seeks, according to what He is John 4:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the virtue of God Rom 3:7; 15:8 becoming our virtue, by which we love the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In such truth, the apostle John, who lived in the divine reality of the Trinity, loved Gaius the beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Prospering in All Things and in Health</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 2 John says, Beloved, concerning all things I wish that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the context of this verse, all things refer to external and material things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Probably the word wish is used in the sense of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Literally, the Greek word for prosper here means to have a good journey, to go on well, that is, to succeed in reaching a desired end; thus, to prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Health here is bodily health, as in Luke 5:31; 7:10; and 15:27.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 2 John speaks of the soul prospering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The soul is the mediating organ between the body and the spirit, possessing self-consciousness, that man may have his personality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The soul is contained in the body and is the vessel to contain the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With the believer, God as the Spirit dwells in his regenerated spirit Rom 8:9, 16 and spreads from his spirit to saturate his soul, that it may be transformed to express Him Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the prosperity of the believer s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When our soul is occupied and directed by the Spirit of God through our spirit to direct and use our body for God s purposes, it prospers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The apostle wishes that the one who receives his Epistle, who is a beloved brother, outstanding in such prosperity of his soul, may prosper in all things and in bodily health, just as his soul prospers in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our body may prosper in health, and our living may prosper in many material things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, our soul needs to prosper in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What, then, is the prosperity of our soul?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The prosperity of our soul is the spreading of the divine life into the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through regeneration the divine life has been imparted to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now from our spirit this life needs to spread into our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If this takes place, our soul will prosper by the spreading of the divine life into it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that we all shall pursue this so that we will have adequate experience of the prospering of our soul through the spreading of the divine life into it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The beloved brother Gaius was prospering in his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The apostle John wished that this brother would not only prosper in his soul, but also prosper in material things and that he would be in health.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This greeting here is particular; it is unique in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The New Testament is a book on spiritual prosperity, not on material things or bodily health.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, John, who writes concerning divine things, wished that the one who received this letter would prosper in bodily health and even in material things.</S>
