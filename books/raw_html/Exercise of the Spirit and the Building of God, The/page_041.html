        <h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING THE SPIRIT<br />
IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>According to the Gospel of John, God is embodied in the Son in order to be enjoyed by man. The characteristic of John&rsquo;s Gospel is that it speaks of how God becomes everything to us in His Son. It begins by saying that the Lord Jesus is the Word: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1). Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; The Word that became flesh is the Lord Jesus. At the end of this book, the Lord Jesus is the Spirit. In chapter 20 Jesus stood in the midst of His disciples, and &ldquo;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). Chapter 14 is the turning point of this book. Chapter 1 says that God is the Word and that the Word became flesh. In chapter 14 the Lord said, &ldquo;If I go...I am coming again&rdquo; (v. 3). His going was His death, and His coming was His resurrection. Through His going and His coming, that is, through His death and resurrection, the Lord Jesus was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. Hence, in verse 20 He said, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (v. 20). This verse speaks of His becoming the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John we can see that Christ is first the Word, and we can also see that through death and resurrection He became the Spirit. The only way to contact Christ is to touch the Word and to contact the Spirit. The more we know the word of Christ, the Bible, and the more we contact the Spirit, the more we will gain Christ. There is no other way to gain Him.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; These two verses show that Christ is contacted through the Word and the Spirit because He is both the Word and the Spirit. Furthermore, His words are spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING THE SPIRIT<br />
THROUGH PRAYER IN ACTS</h2>
<p>The early apostles gained the Lord Jesus first by contacting Him and His words and later by receiving the Spirit. They did not have the four Gospels, which present the Lord Jesus in a clear way, nor did they have the Epistles or Revelation. However, for three and a half years they followed the Lord Jesus every day; they witnessed with their eyes how He lived and walked. They saw Him eat when He was hungry, drink when He was thirsty, sleep when He was fatigued, and weep when He was grieved. In their presence He manifested power, authority, and wisdom. He also manifested the glory of God. Therefore, people often asked, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; (Matt. 21:10; Luke 7:49; 9:9). The disciples read the living Word. During His three and a half years on earth, the Lord was the living Word before their eyes.</p>
<p>For three and a half years the Lord spoke to the disciples. The Lord spoke to them also through His actions and His life. In Matthew 5 through 7 and John 14 through 16, the Lord spoke to them with words. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life and the light of the world (6:35; 8:12). The disciples heard these precious words with their ears, and later they wrote them down for the future generations to read. For three and a half years they &ldquo;read&rdquo; the word of Christ every day. Not only so, the events related to the Lord Jesus&rsquo; betrayal, trial, crucifixion, burial, resurrection from the dead, appearing to them, and ascension on the Mount of Olives were also &ldquo;read&rdquo; by the disciples.</p>
<p>During the three and a half years, the disciples surely &ldquo;read&rdquo; the word of Christ, but did they contact the Spirit? Did they experientially receive the Lord? Was the Lord Jesus mingled with them? Was He everything to them? It was only on the evening of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, when He breathed into the disciples, that the Lord entered into them as the Spirit of resurrection. For three and a half years the disciples saw the Lord, &ldquo;read&rdquo; the Lord, knew Him, and understood Him. Then He died, was raised from the dead, and ascended to the heavens. We cannot deny that they had seen a vision. They saw the Lord on the cross, they witnessed His resurrection, and they saw His ascension. These visions attracted them and kept them from going back to Galilee. In Jerusalem there was a threatening situation, and there was persecution. Their lives were at risk, but they were not afraid. However, their visions were not what kept them in Jerusalem. More than twenty years ago I told people that as long as they saw the glorious Christ, their problems would be solved. Today, I say that seeing a vision is not enough, because we need the Spirit in addition to a vision. For this, we must add prayer, just like the apostles prayed for ten days.</p>
<p>From the Gospels through Acts 1:12, the apostles contacted the living Word. It was not until the second half of chapter 1 that the Word became the Spirit to them. For ten days they contacted the Word with their spirit. As they contacted the Spirit in their spirit, the Word became the Spirit within them; that is, the objective Christ became subjective to them. This is what transpired in the upper room in Jerusalem during those ten days (vv. 13-14). The Word whom they had heard, seen, and spoken with became real in them as the Spirit. As a result, on the day of Pentecost the ascended Christ was poured out upon them as the Spirit.</p>
<p>We must see the progression from the Gospels through Acts 1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. He created all things. Then in time the Word became flesh and lived as a man on the earth. After three and a half years He was crucified, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens. This was the Word. For three and a half years plus forty days, the apostles contacted the Word objectively. After ten days, however, they stopped using their eyes and their mind to contact the Word; rather, through prayer they used their spirit to receive what they had seen and understood. As a result, they began to know not only the Word but also the Spirit. Then, from Pentecost onward, Christ to them was not merely the Word but also the Spirit. The key to their experience was prayer.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
