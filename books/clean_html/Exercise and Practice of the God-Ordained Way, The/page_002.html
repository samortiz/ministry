<h1 class=series>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE ONE</h1><h1 class=title>A THOROUGH VIEW OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY—THE BASIC PRINCIPLES</h1><p>This series of messages was given by Brother Witness Lee in the full-time training in Anaheim in the fall of 1989.<h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1, 4-5, 11; 1:9a; Phil. 3:3; Acts 5:20; 11:18; John 21:15; Rom. 5:10; Eph. 4:11-12; 1 Cor. 14:1, 5, 12</h1><p>Prayer: Lord, we praise You and thank You that You are so merciful and gracious and full of blessing. Lord, we praise You that You are the Victor. You have been put to death, yet You live and are living forever. Because You live, we have hope in Your living life. Lord, thank You for tonight. We are here to listen to Your word. Once again, Lord, open up Yourself to us. We want to open ourselves to You. Cover us that there would be a communication, a fellowship, between You and us in our spirit. We want to speak in You. Lord, speak in our speaking. When we touch Your throne, we cannot forget Your enemy, the evil one, the power of darkness. Lord, we accuse him and ask You to put him to shame. Chase him away, and put him in the corner. Lord, help us. We hide ourselves in You and under Your precious, prevailing blood. Amen.<h2 class=head1>AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</h2><p>This series of messages is a part of the full-time training. In this training, I will take care of only two matters—life and the new way or, rather, the God-ordained way. I will give two messages a week on the matter of life and two on the new way. Concerning life, I will first cover the experience of life and then the growth in life.<p>Concerning the new way, the God-ordained way, this matter has been missed and much neglected by the Lord’s children. Even today, a small number have opposed and rejected the new way. Therefore, I have a burden to put out the things which I have received of the Lord and with which the Lord has burdened me concerning His ordained way for us to serve Him in the church life.<h2 class=head1>THE FOUR MAIN STEPS OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2><p>Concerning the God-ordained way, the New Testament is full of revelation. God wants us to serve Him, but in the New Testament no one is allowed to serve God according to his own concept. We have to serve God according to God’s concept. God’s ordained way has been fully and clearly revealed in the New Testament, yet Christians through all the centuries, from the last part of the first century down to today, have neglected it.<p>What we call the new way is simply this God-ordained way. We must see that this new way is very ancient. It is not old but quite ancient. It was even there with John the Baptist and the early apostles in the first century. Then why do we call this the new way? It is because everything that belongs to God, regardless how ancient it may be, is still new. With God, there is no oldness, everything is new. God is new, but we are always old. With us, things become stale. We may do some service, we may preach the gospel, yet in a stale way. We may help the young believers, but the way we do it may not be that fresh, like the fresh dew early in the morning. We may even perfect some of the saints somewhat, yet our way may be too old, too stale. This is why there is no prophesying to build up the Body of Christ as unveiled in 1 Corinthians 14. Very few Christians through all the generations have known how to prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to minister the Lord to others, that the Body of Christ might be organically built up. Therefore, this matter has actually been put aside. Based upon this, we have to say that this is a new way to us today. So we must endeavor to put aside the old and pick up the new. This is not easy, but we must come back to the Bible to see and to practice the God-ordained way.<p>In the past few years, I have collected all the points related to the God-ordained way and condensed them into four main steps.
