   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE HISTORY OF THE TABERNACLE AND THE ARK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The history of the tabernacle with the ark is vitally important if we would realize God's desire concerning His building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter we saw that when the tabernacle was completed, six major things followed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Firstly, the glory of God Himself appeared on this earth and filled the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The glory of God's presence was clearly seen by His people this is no small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Secondly, God spoke from the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To receive God's word we must come to the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thirdly, a priestly service or a priesthood was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Fourthly, this priesthood was also an army to fight the battle for God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Fifthly, all the battles were won with the purpose of gaining the ground for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And lastly, the tabernacle was set up as a worship center in a place called Shiloh Josh 18:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From that time, any person seeking the Lord, such as Samuel's parents 1 Sam 1:3-9 , had a definite place to go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How wonderful the situation was!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But it did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE ARK CAPTURED</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During the time of Eli the priest, the people of Israel failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were sinful in the eyes of God; they were wrong with God; yet they still went on to fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, they were defeated 1 Sam 4:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must realize that whenever the children of God are defeated by the enemy, it is proof that they are wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are rightly related to God, we can never be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are wrong with Him, we must be defeated, for the ground is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must learn this vital lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Though the Israelites were defeated, they would not learn their lesson, they would not be judged and dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, they developed a certain superstitious attitude concerning the power of the ark of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because they were wrong with God they misused the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They superstitiously planned to let the ark fight the battle for them 1 Sam 4:3-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE ARK SEPARATED FROM THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ark did not help the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were defeated, the ark was captured, and the two sons of Eli the priest, the two leaders, were killed 1 Sam 4:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The glory of God departed from the Israelites 1 Sam 4:19-22 , and the tabernacle was left empty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They retained the outward expression, but it was an empty vessel; the content was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ark failed to protect them, for they had not learned their lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In a sense, the Israelites were not completely superstitious in depending upon the ark to win their battle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The ark was indeed powerful, for it did protect itself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After defeating the people of Israel in battle, the Philistines placed the captured ark in their own temple, and in so doing their idol was slain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, the ark itself defeated and subdued the Philistines 1 Sam 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Philistines had vanquished thousands of the Israelites in battle, but they could not vanquish the little ark.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They simply did not know how to handle it nor what to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually they decided to send the troublesome ark back to the Israelites and did so 1 Sam 6:1-16 , sending it to Beth-shemesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Upon receiving the ark, the people of Beth-shemesh dealt carelessly with it, and many of them were smitten by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Beth-shemeshites then sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, asking them to take the ark to their place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the men of Kirjath-jearim fetched the ark and brought it into the house of a priest named Abinadab, where it remained for twenty years 1 Sam 6:12 7:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The situation was indeed abnormal: the tabernacle with the altar was in Shiloh, but the ark was in Kirjath-jearim.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The content was separated from the vessel, and the vessel was left empty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This situation prevailed until a full recovery was realized by the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The ark must be in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would have a normal church life, we must have Christ, the ark, in the church, the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All these events in the history of Samuel, Saul, and David occurred with only one object and purpose in view God's building.</S>
