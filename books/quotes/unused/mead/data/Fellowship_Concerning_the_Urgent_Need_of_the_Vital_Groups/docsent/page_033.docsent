   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RELEASING OUR SPIRIT THROUGH PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The proper prayer always releases us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we pray and our spirit is not exercised and released, our prayer is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Prayer must exercise our spirit and release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When our spirit is released by our prayer, we are released persons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we are no longer bound but released, we are always happy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why Paul said, Always rejoice, unceasingly pray 1 Thes 5:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To rejoice all the time is related to praying unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, if we are not released, we cannot be blended with others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we come to the meeting with a quiet spirit, we are bound.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we attend the vital group meetings in this way, there is no possibility of our being blended.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you are released, when I am released, and when everyone is released, that is the real blending.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The way for us to become blended is through prayer that releases our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts 1:14 says that the one hundred twenty continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer, together with the women....</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to consider why the Bible says with the women in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every word in the Bible is written with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I hope the sisters would give me the permission to speak a frank word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The one accord is always troubled by the women.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the sisters have no problem in the church, the church will most likely have no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the church life there are generally more sisters than brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the home in Bethany spoken of in John 12, there were two sisters and one brother vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can see from this that the church life greatly depends upon the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the sisters are okay, the church life will most likely be okay.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The vital future of the vital groups greatly depends upon the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the sisters are blended, the blending of the groups will be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to be blended, all of us need to release our spirit in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may pray together without being released in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, all of us may be bound.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most of the good composers of long prayers are sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Few among the brothers would pray long prayers full of explanations and descriptions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I would advise some of the sisters not to pray that many times.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Also, we should not pray too fast because the saints will not be able to follow our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul indicated that we need to pray in a way that the saints will be able to say Amen to our prayer 1 Cor 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should pray so that others can hear our prayer, understand our prayer, realize our prayer, agree with our prayer, and thus say Amen to our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I realize that all of us in this training love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To find a group of people loving the Lord and loving the recovery so much is a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we have all been annulled by our shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all have our particular shortcomings which annul us and forfeit our proper function.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all have defects which prevent us from being fully profitable to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But in spite of all our disadvantages, the Lord is still with His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our cooperating with the Lord to move to Russia has been a great encouragement to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Within less than one year we raised up churches in Moscow and St. Petersburg.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord has blessed us with the laborers, with the material supply, and with the fruitful result in His move in Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This shows that in spite of all of our shortcomings and defects, the Lord has still blessed His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I appreciate that all of us love the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we did not love the recovery, we would not be here.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we need to see that in the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the first dealing of the Lord is concerning the recovery of the first love 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do we love Him?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Surely we do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But do we give Him the preeminence, the first place, in all things?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To give the Lord the first place in all things is to love Him with the first love, the best love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to give Him the preeminence, we must be willing to be adjusted, to be broken, to be made nothing, so that the Lord can have a way in us, through us, and among us for the building up of His organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this message I would also like to recommend Hymns, #846.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It will help us to read, pray, and sing this hymn:</S>
