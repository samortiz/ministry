<p>The Samaritan woman turned the conversation to an impersonal subject, but the Lord Jesus brought to her a practical and spiritual matter. She asked concerning the place where God should be worshipped, but the Lord Jesus showed her that worshipping God does not depend on the place but on the human spirit. Her question concerned the place for worshipping God in religion, but the Lord Jesus brought her to the reality of worshipping God in spirit. The reality of worshipping God does not depend on a place but on the human spirit.</p>
<p>To worship God is to contact God. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him, contact Him, must worship in spirit. Because God is Spirit, He wants man to contact Him in spirit. Therefore, worshipping God does not depend on a place but on the human spirit. God is Spirit, and He is omnipresent. He is like radio waves. No matter where people are, as long as they worship Him in spirit, they will contact Him.</p>
<p>God is not physical, nor is He mental; He is Spirit. Hence, man cannot use his physical body or his mind to contact God. Man must use his spirit to contact God. The mind, man&rsquo;s psychology, is not the deepest part of man. The human spirit is the deepest part of man. It is deeper than man&rsquo;s mind. Man must use his spirit to worship and contact God. Man contacts God with his spirit, not with his body or mind. Man can use only his deepest part, his spirit, to contact God.</p>
<p>Contacting God with the human spirit is not a matter of thinking with your mind but of praying to God according to the feeling in your heart. If you pray to God with the thoughts in your mind, you are not contacting God with your spirit. If you want to contact God with your spirit, you must ignore the thoughts of your mind and pray to God according to the feeling in your heart because your heart includes the conscience, which is a part of the human spirit. Tell God what your heart feels. You do not need to think of what to say. If you feel pain, tell God that you have pain. If you have problems and burdens, tell God that you have problems and burdens. If you feel that you are corrupt, evil, and sinful, tell God that you are corrupt, evil, and sinful. Tell God what you feel. Only such prayer is contacting God in spirit, and only such prayer can contact God.</p>
<p>If you want to contact something, you must use the right organ and the right method. If you use the wrong organ or the wrong method, you will not be able to contact that thing. For example, you must use your ears to hear sounds and your nose to smell. Otherwise, you will say that sounds and scents do not exist. Similarly, you must use the right organ and right method to contact God. God is Spirit; hence, you cannot contact Him if you merely use your mind to think about Him. The more you think, the more you will say that there is no God. God is Spirit, and He wants man to contact Him; hence, man must use his spirit and pray to contact God. Even though God is invisible to human eyes and intangible to human hands, He is contactable and perceptible to the human spirit. If you pray to God according to the feeling in your heart, you will contact Him in your spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s step-by-step leading of the Samaritan woman shows that in order to obtain the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and life, a person must ask the Lord. When someone asks the Lord for salvation, he must first let the Lord lead him to see his sins and to confess them to the Lord, and he must also pray to the Lord according to the feeling in his heart. If someone confesses his sins to the Lord and prays to Him from his heart, he will contact the Lord and obtain salvation and the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago we preached the gospel for several days in Chefoo. A customs officer came to hear the message every day and was quite moved. After the last meeting he told me that he wanted to believe in the Lord because the messages spoke to his many problems. However, he did not know how to believe, and he did not know how to contact the Lord in order to receive the Lord&rsquo;s life. I told him to pray, and he asked, &ldquo;How do I pray?&rdquo; I explained that to pray is not to compose an essay or an official document. Therefore, he did not need to think about what to say; he only needed to open his heart to the Lord and pray according to the feelings in his heart. He should tell the Lord what he felt in his heart. That night he told his family that he had something important to do. Instead of eating dinner, he shut the door to his room and prayed to the Lord. When he began to pray, the Lord led him to sense his sins so that he confessed all his sins one by one to the Lord. He received the Lord as his Savior. The next morning he discovered that he was a different person. He had been saved and had received the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>After the Lord&rsquo;s practical and spiritual word to the Samaritan woman, she asked Him about Christ, and the Lord told her that He was Christ. Then her eyes were opened, and she realized that this One who asked her for water, the Lord who spoke to her, was Christ. She had brought her waterpot to draw water, but she did not know that she would meet Christ there. She could not think of Christ when her heart was consumed with the waterpot, but now both Christ and her waterpot were in front of her.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Changing Death into Life &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
