   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GUARANTEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the one hand, we are God s. On the other hand, He is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because we are His, we are sealed and possessed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because He is ours, we have received the guarantee that He is our portion, our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our inheritance has nothing to do with material things; it is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have the Holy Spirit as the guarantee, pledge, down payment, deposit, foretaste, and sample, of our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>CREATED</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians 2:10 says, For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse does not speak of the first creation, but of the second creation, the creation of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all have been created together as God s masterpiece, God s poem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Greek word rendered masterpiece means something which has been made, a handiwork, or something which has been written or composed as a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is a poem written by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the universe nothing is more meaningful than the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church, the corporate new man, is God s masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning the church, the word created is used three times in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition to 2:10, it is used in 2:15, which says that Christ abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances in order to create one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 4:24 we are told that the new man was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From a human point of view, there are many deficiencies and shortcomings in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But from God s perspective in eternity, the church is a finished product, something already accomplished by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is happy and can boast to His enemy, Satan, no matter how much you try to do, I have already accomplished My work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have created the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the eyes of God the church has already been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BECOME NEAR</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ephesians 2:13 says, But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have become near in the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we were far off from God and from one another, but in Christ Jesus God has caused us to become near.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before we were saved and brought near, we could not speak of one another as brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But now we have the deep sense that in Christ we are closer to one another than we are to our brothers and sisters in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>ENLIGHTENED</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now let us go on to consider certain items which from God s point of view have been accomplished, but from the standpoint of our experience are still in the process of being accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first is the matter of being enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1:18 Paul speaks of the eyes of our heart being enlightened, and in 5:14, of Christ shining on us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a sense, God has already enlightened us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in another sense, we still need to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may be covered, veiled, by certain things, and need to turn to the light so that the light may shine on us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we would be enlightened, we need to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to 1:17 and 18, enlightenment is related to receiving a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we stay in our natural mind, we shall be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if we turn to our regenerated spirit, we shall be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am concerned for those who do not open themselves up in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be closed in this way is to be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to open ourselves by uttering something for the Lord in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we turn from our reasonings to the spirit, we are enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We rise up, and Christ shines on us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we stand up to speak, the light shines on us, and we are enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more we are enlightened, the more we experience the work God has accomplished concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>STRENGTHENED</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In chapter three Paul prayed that our inner man, our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit, would be strengthened with power v. 16 . When we are enlightened, we realize the need for our inner man to be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>INDWELT</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our inner man needs to be strengthened so that Christ may make His home in our hearts 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For Christ to make His home in us means that we are indwelt by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ, the living Person, desires to dwell in us, to fill every part of our inward being with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of our inward parts need to be a home for Christ so that we may be fully occupied by Him.</S>
