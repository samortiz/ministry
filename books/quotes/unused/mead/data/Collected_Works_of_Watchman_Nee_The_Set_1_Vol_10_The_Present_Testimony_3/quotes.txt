[2]  Dear Readers: Since the publication of the last volume of The Present Testimony, I have continued to revise the book The Spiritual Man.
[3]  Praise God that it has been in print for more than a month now.
[4]  If a man does not love God's revelation and only understands the truth in this book in his mind, never has any dealing of the cross, and does not have a seeking heart, but merely likes the truth in this book superficially, his behavior will be completely opposite to the truth in this book when a time of trial or even a time of testing comes.
[5]  Man's psychological faculty is very sensitive and most easily affected by outward stimulations.
[6]  Words, attitudes, circumstances, human affections that come from the outside are able to affect us emotionally.
[7]  This passage of the Bible has often been a help to me; even now it is a continuous help to me.
[8]  The passage prior to Mark 6:45-52 speaks of the Lord Jesus feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fish.
[9]  It says that after the Lord Jesus distributed the loaves and fish, He continued to speak a very important teaching: "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven" v. 51 . The Lord meant that just as the people were filled with bread that day, they would have eternal life by similarly eating His flesh and drinking His blood.
[10]  What did the disciples encounter when they went forward?
[11]  They were "distressed as they rowed, for the wind was contrary to them."
[12]  Brothers and sisters, if your walk is contrary to the wind, then surely those opposite you will be walking with the wind.
[13]  Penn-Lewis once said, "Many believers say that they have encountered a lot of pressure.
[14]  As we behold this situation, we cannot help but call upon the churches of God to rise up, strengthen themselves, and return to fellowship with God, so that in the remaining days, they will please the Lord and be prepared to "be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ" 2 Cor 5:10 and give an account of what they have done.
[15]  Praise God that His grace and power have enabled us once again to publish another volume of The Present Testimony.
[16]  Concerning those who have corresponded with me, I would like you to know I have read your letters and sympathize with you, but because of my physical weakness, busy schedule, frequent travel, and lack of help, in many cases I have been unable to answer them right away.
[17]  We have to remember that we are all sinners because we are all in Adam.
[18]  We do not need to make an effort to lose our temper, lie, etc., because Adam's nature, life, and behavior have all flowed into us.
[19]  God's way of salvation is not by making us better but by delivering us out of Adam and putting us into Christ.
[20]  The Bible shows that as long as we are in Adam, we will sin; and as long as we are in Christ, we are righteous.
[21]  Some people think that because the root of sin is still in us even though we are saved, we need to ask God to do another thing on us: to remove the root of sin in us like pulling out a bad tooth.
[22]  If He removes the root of our sin, we will have no need to believe.
[23]  He wants us to look to Him day by day and believe His Word which says that we are a new creation in Christ.
[24]  If you expect God to do a new thing on you, it is impossible to say how long you would have to pray.
[25]  If you want God to do a work on you, you will not only be disappointed today and tomorrow; you will be disappointed until the day you die.
[26]  1 He who believes into Christ is in Christ.
[27]  John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."
[28]  When you believe into Him Christ , your sin becomes His, and He becomes one with you.
[29]  GOD'S WAY OF REDEMPTION A Message on the Lord's Day Morning Issue No. 25 Scripture Reading: Gal 4:4-5; Rom 10:17; Heb 11:6; Gal 4:6; John 14:26; 16:13
[30]  Deep within me I feel the need to give a message on the significance of faith.
[31]  Hebrews 11:6 says, "But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him."
[32]  The most important thing in the entire life of a Christian is to please God.
[33]  If a Christian does not have faith, he cannot be well pleasing to God.
[34]  It is extremely important to believe in the Word of God.
[35]  The Bible says, "Every one who believes into Him may have eternal life" John 3:15 .
[36]  It also says, "Believe into Me," "Believe into My name," etc. What do we believe in? Is believing in the Lord Jesus just believing in His works? Romans 10:17 says, "So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ." If we do not have the word of Christ, what can we believe? The Word of God brings what is far away near to us.
[37]  If a person has not laid hold of the Word, I would say that he has not believed in Christ.
[38]  Once I met a patient, and I asked him how he was doing.
[39]  I said that God would not heal him because he did not have His word.
[40]  There was another nearsighted brother who needed to get corrective glasses, but someone told him that he should believe God and not get the glasses.
[41]  If you would read to God the verse that you heard last week, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands" Col 2:11 , and if you would read the same verse to yourself, you would gain something.
[42]  I know that Satan and his evil spirits are very busy, for he is aware that the message of The Present Testimony is harmful to him.
[43]  Editor's Note: The Latent Power of the Soul was published in Issue Nos.
[44]  In 1924 when I first called the attention of God's children to the distinction between the spirit and soul, some well-intentioned brothers thought that this was only a dispute over words and that it had no real significance.
[45]  Revelation 18:11-13 says, "And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargo anymore: cargo of gold and silver and precious stone and pearls...and cattle and sheep, and cargo of horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men."
[46]  Genesis 1:27-28 says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
[47]  And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
[48]  We are not trying to be curious; we are merely trying to see what God had given Adam.
[49]  Not only Christians, but Babylonians, Arabians, Buddhists, Taoists, and Hindus, all try their best to release everything concealed in the soul which we inherited from Adam.
[50]  No matter what religion, no matter how different the practices, methods, and procedures, there is a common principle behind these practices: they all try to overcome the outward flesh and freely release the soulish power from every kind of bondage.
[51]  I do not know how some know of the marvelous power that is dormant within the flesh, and I do not know how some discovered that this power was bound up in the flesh and that it will turn them into a so-called "super being" or "buddha" once it is released and its miraculous power is manifested.
[52]  We need to see the power of the soul from the scientific perspective.
[53]  Whether in China, Europe, or the United States, and whether it is breathing exercises, asceticism, meditations, hypnosis, predictions, telepathy, or pathetism, they all cultivate the inward power and its expressions.
[54]  I think you all have heard of many miraculous things done through hypnotism.
[55]  In China there are many fortune-tellers who have done many things that we are all familiar with.
[56]  Friends, all of the miraculous things in religion and science are manifestations of a person's latent power and are utilized by the evil spirits.
[57]  They have one common principle, which is to break down the barriers of the flesh and release the soulish power.
[58]  We Christianity are different from them because all our miracles are done by God through the Holy Spirit.
[59]  However, Satan is utilizing soulish power to express his supernatural abilities and make man as God.
[60]  The only safety for the child of God is an experimental knowledge of the life in union with Christ wherein he dwells with Christ in God, above the poisonous air in which the prince of the power of the air carries on his work.
[61]  We have seen that, when God created Adam, Adam had a certain kind of supernatural and miraculous power.
[62]  Later on, this miraculous power fell as a result of Adam's fall.
[63]  During the past five or six thousand years, some people, though not many, have been able to demonstrate this kind of power, even those who have not believed in the Lord Jesus.
[64]  As soon as man fell, God concealed all the power of man within man's flesh and put him under the rule of the flesh.
[65]  The latent power of the soul, according to the Bible and even in psychology, can be classified into two categories.
[66]  We admit that we cannot separate the two categories too clearly, nor definitively categorize the contents of each category.
[67]  But we can say that within the latent power of the soul, one category seems to be ordinary while the other seems to be miraculous; one category seems to be natural while the other seems to be supernatural; one category seems to be humanly comprehensible while the other seems to be beyond human comprehension.
[68]  If we just pray to the God in the room, I am afraid that we will have many strange feelings, miraculous experiences, and strange visions from the God.
[69]  If an experienced Christian in the Lord is present at a revival meeting, he will know whether the preacher is using his soul-power or the power of the Spirit.
[70]  It is a complete union with God and the entire loss of self.
[71]  Whether or not we sense God in our feeling, we have the leading of the intuition within which teaches us to know God.
[72]  Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist, denied that there was death, sickness, or pain.
[73]  Today they tell others that a patient only needs to believe he has no illness and he will not feel pain, and that a dying person only needs to believe he will not die, and he will not die.
[74]  THE LATENT POWER OF THE SOUL 3 Issue No. 28 THE ASPECT WHICH IS NOT MIRACULOUS
[75]  Today we will continue with the subject we have been speaking on the last two Lord's Days, which is the work of the power of the soul and its functions.
[76]  Of the many things happening in this last age, how can we know which are done by God and which are not?
[77]  Fourth, you must learn how to pray to God with faith, receive answers from God, and witness miracles from God.
[78]  The first thing we will see is the work of personal preaching.
[79]  You should say to God, "I do not know what this person is thinking about nor what his psychological condition is; neither do I know what his spiritual condition is; I just come to You without relying on anything else.
[80]  In reading the Bible, sometimes there is also the danger of developing the latent power of the soul.
[81]  For example, a person may not understand a certain portion of the Scripture; he may continue to think about it while he is walking, lying on his bed, in his study, or on the tram.
[82]  I am not saying that God cannot convey His thought to us while we are thinking, nor am I saying that God cannot give us His word suddenly on the road or in a room.
[83]  This is a great principle; this principle allows us to differentiate between the things of the spirit and the things of the soul.
[84]  When God works, He works with His own power.
[85]  This is why we have to ask God to bind our soul.
[86]  We need to ask God to bind these things and say to Him, "Lord, whatever talents and abilities I have, I will not use them; I only want You to do the work.
[87]  Since the lines and stakes of my earthly tabernacle are often shaken, I have not done a thorough job in answering letters and in corresponding with you.
[88]  I beg your forgiveness in my belated, or even lack, of response.
[89]  The prayer of our Lord Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane was for the purpose of knowing God's will.
[90]  Our Lord knew that He ought to press out the oil there, so He knelt down and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will" Matt 26:39 .
[91]  From the experiences of the Lord and the apostle Paul we can see one principle: if a man desires to know God, he must learn how to deal with God.
[92]  If you fear God, you will not easily let the sins that you cannot overcome go by; you will certainly want to deal with God.
[93]  Perhaps God will tell you that you are wrong in certain things, or perhaps He will tell you that you do not realize the corruption of your flesh and that you are dependent on yourself.
[94]  If you know God and have experienced God's dealings, you will know at which point someone cannot get through.
[95]  Since you may have experienced dealing with God more than fifty times in certain matters, you can help others go through the same.
[96]  You are not just telling someone about the Bible, but are telling them about God.
[97]  His preaching was good, but several laymen's words slipped out from his mouth; therefore, I knew that he did not know God in this matter at all.
[98]  Not only do we have to deal with our sins, and not only do we have to know God, but we need dealings in our environment as well.
[99]  If you pray only once and then stop praying because you do not receive God's answer, you can never expect to know God.
[100]  If God does not answer you the first, second, or third time, you should pray ten times or a hundred times until God speaks to you.
[101]  I could easily find Colossians 2:14-15 in the Bible, which says that Christ triumphed over everything on the cross, or Hebrews 2:14, which says that through death He destroyed him who has the might of death, or 1 John 3:8, which says that the Son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the devil, or Revelation 12:11, which says that the brothers overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb.
[102]  Let me also say a few words to those brothers and sisters who are co-workers.
[103]  No one can work for God without knowing God.
[104]  I would like to ask this: when we preach the gospel to others, are we merely giving them some Bible expositions, or are we giving them the Savior?
[105]  Even if the seminary is as good as you think, it can only teach you to understand the Bible; it cannot teach you to know God.
[106]  Today many people understand the Bible, many can even systematize the Bible in a very good order, but how many of them can minister God and know God?
[107]  Today we have so much preaching with so little result because we have not been dealt with by God nor taught by God.
[108]  We should ask God what we should do in this or that matter, and we should not stop asking until we know God.
[109]  Today we will continue to consider the matter of knowing God.
[110]  In other words, we will learn how to have dealings with God.
[111]  As time passes by, if they get what they pray for, they say that God has answered their prayers; if not, they say that God has not answered their prayers.
[112]  If you ask anyone these questions, he may tell you that you should pray to remove sin, that prayer should be with faith, or that you should pray according to God's will, etc. He may give many doctrines about prayer.
[113]  If after three or four months God still has not answered your prayer, and you do not know why, you must have a seeking and searching heart to ask Him why He answered your prayer the first time but not this time.
[114]  If we learn how to deal with God and how to be dealt with by God in everything, that is, if we learn to have dealings with God in everything, we will know what God wants from us, what He wants to remove from us, and what He wants to accomplish in us.
[115]  I will mention a few more things about our experience so that we can know God more.
[116]  If we do not learn them, God will not answer our prayers.
[117]  God has not answered us, so we forget about it and so does God.
[118]  If we can let go of something whether or not God answers our prayer, He will certainly not answer our prayer, because He knows that it does not matter to us.
[119]  If we ask God again, He may tell us that while we truly have a desire, we have not asked; we have not opened our mouth to speak out what we want.
[120]  Suppose that you want God to answer your prayer and you have a desire within and an asking without, and God still has not answered your prayers.
[121]  If you pray again and ask God why He has not answered you, He may say that you still have not obeyed Him in one thing and that He will not listen to your prayer until you obey Him in that one thing.
[122]  The kind of knowledge which you acquire through dealing with God and through being dealt with by God is very different from the knowledge you acquire from reading the Bible or listening to messages.
[123]  If you still do not have it, God may tell you that you need to deal with some things before you can have the faith.
[124]  However, after praising again and again, you still may have not received what you prayed for.
[125]  You then find out that after you have faith, you must not only praise, but also must remind God.
[126]  He said to God, "Now, O Lord God, let thy promise unto David my father be established" 2 Chron 1:9 .
[127]  In the future I will speak on this topic specifically.
[128]  Perhaps I will need to speak four or five messages on this.
[129]  If we want to know God's will, we also need to deal with God.
[130]  If we have not been dealt with by God, we cannot know His will.
[131]  I would like to speak some words to the co-workers: if you have not learned to be dealt with by God and to deal with God, you can never go out to work because you are not yet even a proper Christian.
[132]  This surely is a time of temptations; everything is confusing, cold, and harsh.
[133]  SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE Notes from a Meeting Held in 1932 Issue No. 29 Scripture Reading: John 3:16; 14:16; 15:4-5; 14:17; 6:47; 4:14; 1 John 2:8; Phil 1:20-21; 1 Cor 1:30; Col 1:27
[134]  We often speak about the matter of subjective truth and objective truth.
[135]  If we want to discover these two aspects of the truth in the Bible, we can find several hundred verses which show the subjective aspect of the truth as well as the objective aspect of the truth.
[136]  If we can grasp these two aspects, we are able to grasp the tracks in the Bible.
[137]  In the first two centuries, believers greeted each other by saying, "The Lord is coming soon," or, "In Christ."
[138]  Indeed, once we see that we are in Christ, everything is sweet and precious.
[139]  At the same time, the Spirit within us will put to death the deeds of the body.
[140]  Likewise, when the Spirit says to you that your temper, pride, and jealousy have been crucified, if you are willing and have the desire, the Spirit will give you the power to overcome.
[141]  Philippians 3:10 says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection."
[142]  Paul said that the goal of his counting all things loss was to know the power of resurrection.
[143]  He did not say he wanted to know resurrection, because once a person has believed, he has resurrection.
[144]  But on the subjective side he still needed to count all things loss in order to know the power of His resurrection.
[145]  Concerning the Lord's ascension, you do not know how much time I spent shortly after I was saved thinking how good it would be if only I could daily sit in the heavenlies and have my sin under my feet.
[146]  In the Bible there are two ways of translating the word mind: in some places it is translated "mind," and in other places it is translated "understanding."
[147]  The spirit gives us God-consciousness; it enables us to have communication with God and sense God.
[148]  The word mind is nous in the original language.
[149]  Romans 1:28 says, "And even as they did not approve of holding God in their full knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mind, to do the things which are not fitting."
[150]  What exactly is the nous as spoken of in the New Testament?
[151]  We think it is sufficient if we have a new heart, but the Bible speaks not only of this; it also says that our nous needs to be renewed.
[152]  Our Christian lives are not necessarily the same toward God.
[153]  In a believer whose nous has not been renewed we can see the following characteristics toward God: he cannot trust God, he cannot know God in the same way that he knows the Lord Jesus as his Savior, and he has many doubts.
[154]  These three points constitute his attitude toward God: he doubts God's power, thinking that He is not capable; he doubts God's wisdom, thinking that He is wrong; and he doubts God's lovingkindness, thinking that He is unwilling.
[155]  If we can only be a courier, simply passing on to others what we have received without receiving anything directly from God, our nous must be wrong.
[156]  If we merely depend on others to pass things to us and then simply pass to others what little we have received, without receiving anything directly from God, we are not very useful.
[157]  The Unrenewed Nous to Ourselves A. Being Unable to Manage One's Own Thoughts
[158]  If our hands can only work for eight hours a day, and what we do during these eight hours is improper, it becomes a waste of energy and a hindrance to proper work.
[159]  If no one leads you on, you will put yourself in a dangerous position, and you may even think that you are not saved, that you have committed an unforgivable sin, or that God has forsaken you.
[160]  God communicates with us through our spirit, not through our soul or our body.
[161]  Therefore, we always need to keep an open and unveiled spirit in the presence of God so that we can have a living communication with Him.
[162]  If the nous is closed, God cannot give light to the spirit, because even if He gave light to the spirit, there would be no channel to express what the spirit had received.
[163]  Many Christians have been bedridden for years and still can serve God, obey God, and do the work of prayer.
[164]  Ephesians 4:17-24 says, "This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their nous, being darkened in their dianoia Greek for "understanding" , alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness.
[165]  But you did not so learn Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus, that you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your nous and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality."
[166]  Let us pay attention to verses 17 and 18 which say that the nous of the Gentiles is corrupted by vanity, and the heart is hardened and alienated from the life of God.
[167]  A Gentile is so corrupted that he has lost all feeling.
[168]  The function of the nous is darkened because the Gentiles are alienated from the life of God, and they are alienated from the life of God because they are ignorant and hardened in their heart.
[169]  When someone preaches something that is different from our belief and practice, we should ask God if his speaking is really improper.
[170]  Some people think too much with their head; others are too empty in their head and do not think at all.
[171]  We should pay attention to one more matter: the trouble with man's nous originates in man's heart; therefore, if the nous is to be renewed, the prejudiced heart must also be corrected.
[172]  Although this correcting does not mean a so-called cultivation of the heart, that idea is, nevertheless, included in this correcting.
[173]  An improper motive will block the light of God.
[174]  Whoever is willing to say to God, "God, if You teach me right now, I thank You; if You do not teach me right now, I will not insist," can be taught by God.
[175]  Concerning God, we can speak of three aspects: 1 glory, referring to God Himself; 2 holiness, referring to God's nature; and 3 righteousness, referring to the way God acts.
[176]  Several years ago I saw in a magazine something written by Mrs. Penn-Lewis which said, "If your spirit is obstructed, it is because your nous is obstructed." In other words, the spirit is closed because the nous is closed.
[177]  I saw and appreciated these words, but my spiritual life at that time was very shallow, and I could not fully understand.
[178]  I do not know what more I can say to lead you into this deep truth and help you have a renewed nous.
[179]  Romans 12:1-2 says, "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service.
[180]  If you can consecrate these things to Him and put them upon the altar, your renewed nous will receive double strength from God, and you will understand God's desire and will; you will be able to think and understand everything about God.
[181]  Originally, the nous of many people is like a kitchen window that is covered with grease.
[182]  After the nous is renewed, it is like a clean glass window which allows sunlight to come through.
[183]  FAITH AND OBEDIENCE Notes from the Conference in 1932 Issue No. 30 Scripture Reading: Rom 6:11-14
[184]  Today I will speak about the principles of Christian living.
[185]  The entire New Testament shows us that there are only two principles of Christian living; everything else is merely fruit that issues from these two principles.
[186]  It is the Holy Spirit removing the veil and showing you what lies behind a preacher's speaking.
[187]  You may have seen what is meant by forgiveness and regeneration.
[188]  When you saw that Christ Jesus died in such a way, you believed.
[189]  There are many people who pray for death with Christ, but God says that in Christ we are dead.
[190]  There are many who pray to overcome the world, but the Word of God says that the victory which has overcome the world is our faith 1 John 5:4 .
[191]  Whenever God touches us on a certain point, and instead we want God to go along with us, we are not obeying God.
[192]  Brothers, I have recently felt, more strongly than ever before, that if we want to serve the Lord, we must specifically know the Lord.
[193]  Many experiences, many gifts, and considerable Bible knowledge cannot present Christ in a living way to people.
[194]  Each day we must depend on Him to do what we cannot do, to live a life which we cannot live.
[195]  In 2 Corinthians 1:8-10, what did Paul want the brothers to know?
[196]  He wanted them to know of the affliction which befell him in Asia.
[197]  The final outcome was this: "We should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead; who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us" vv.
[198]  I would like to ask the brothers who are sitting here today: how many of you have the clear experience of overcoming sins?
[199]  Which of you is clear about the law of the Spirit of life setting us free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death?
[200]  Are there any among you who have ever dealt with sin and been clearly set free from sin?
[201]  At such times, we will find the power to come to God and the power to receive the victory of Christ.
[202]  He said, "For I could wish that I myself were a curse, separated from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh" Rom 9:3 .
[203]  If Israel could not be saved, he would rather lose his own salvation.
[204]  Not only is there the pressure of sin and the pressure of need; there is also the pressure of environment.
[205]  God wants the believers to go through pressure on earth so that they may lead a proper life.
[206]  If we encounter something which pierces us with heart-searing pains, causing us to weep silently with no way to comfort ourselves or get through the matter, and we trust in God at these times, we will experience complete victory.
[207]  He said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" John 12:24 .
[208]  May we know Christ and the power of His resurrection more deeply day by day.
[209]  He did not consider himself as having already obtained or as being already perfected, but he pursued after the power of Christ's resurrection in order to know, that is, experience it Phil 3:12, 10 .
[210]  In 2 Corinthians 4:8-10 he said, "We are pressed on every side but not constricted this indicates the outward circumstances ; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out; persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body."
[211]  Many of God's works have to go through pressure before they will have good results.
[212]  If you are a faithful person, you may have had this experience already, and you may very well have more in the future.
[213]  In that day when we stand before God, we will realize what pressure our Lord Jesus Christ suffered, what pressure was upon the apostles, and what pressure was upon all those who were very much used by God.
[214]  At present many believers do not know the pressure of Satan.
[215]  The enemy can do many works in our living, environment, and life.
[216]  My purpose today is not to expound Matthew 7:13-14 but to show the kind of way a Christian should take.
[217]  I will not delve, however, into the specific lessons that are intended for the Christians because this is not the purpose of my message.
[218]  If a Christian wants to believe in God in a certain matter, he must first have a one-time specific act of believing; he must have a one-time genuine faith in God before he can walk on the way of faith.
[219]  Among all the things we believe in, one chief item is the matter of being "in Christ."
[220]  According to the New Testament teaching, God has saved us and put us in Christ.
[221]  Austin-Sparks is a servant much used by the Lord today.
[222]  The most precious truth to him is "in Christ."
[223]  The turning point in his life came when the Lord opened his eyes to see the riches in Christ.
[224]  However, after we have seen the oneness we have with the Lord, does this mean that we will no longer lose our temper or that we will never be jealous again?
[225]  Once God has opened our eyes, we will see the riches in Christ, and the devil will come and tempt, saying, "You say that all the blessings are in Christ.
[226]  Some people may proclaim one day, "I have triumphed over my temper in Christ."
[227]  But the next day pride comes in. They may think, "Oh no, why is it that yesterday I overcame my temper, but today pride is rising up in me? Could it be that the word in the Bible that says, For you died,' is not dependable?" No, we have to walk on the way of faith.
[228]  Brothers and sisters, if you have not specifically put down your will and surrendered it to God, if you have not dropped what is precious to you and rejected the things you love, you should not expect to be able to walk on the way of obedience.
[229]  Brothers and sisters, if you still do not know what God requires of you, what He expects of you, and how He deals with this or that matter, and if you are still at a loss about everything, you have never entered the gate of obedience.
