Man's sins not only make man a sinner with a charge against him before God, but they also cause him to become stained and defiled in himself
There is none whose heart is clean and sinless, nor is there anyone who can make his heart clean and purify himself from sin
The uncleanness of the universe and of the human race comes from sin; hence, the redeeming blood is required for purification
There first must be the shedding of blood for redemption from sins and then the blood can be used to wash the uncleanness of sin
The Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross to accomplish redemption for our sins that His blood might purify us from the uncleanness of sin
Although the Lord's blood also purifies our conscience within, this purification is for us to come forward to God with boldness
Having offered one sacrifice for sins to take away our sin and make purification of our sins forever, He sat down on the right hand of God
According to the revelation of the Bible, the blood of Christ does not cleanse our heart; rather, it purifies our conscience
On the other hand, our conscience represents God and, in particular, God's law; that is, it reflects God and God's law
Because the Lord's blood has washed away our sins before God and before His law, it also washes away our sins before our conscience
Many sins that we committed and many evil, lustful, and filthy things that we did are known by the people around us
At the time we believe and are saved, God uses another means to wash away the stain of sins which we have before men
We are loosed from the stain of sins which we have before men and become the repentant and washed ones in their eyes
The washing that God has prepared for us in His salvation consists not only of the positional aspect but also of the dispositional aspect
The positional aspect stresses the removing of the defilement in our behavior before God, before His law, and before our conscience
His life and His nature cause us to be delivered from our unclean life and defiled nature, that is, from our dispositional defilement
God's washing also results in our being made inwardly pure and without blemish both in life and in nature as He is
Man's sins not only make man a sinner with a charge against him before God, but they cause him to become stained and defiled in himself
The washing which we receive at the time we are saved is of two aspects: positional washing and dispositional washing
The blood also cleanses our conscience that we may come forward to God with boldness to serve Him with a pure conscience
The result of God's washing is that before God we become as white as snow, even whiter than snow, just as if we had never sinned
Concerning the matter of sanctification, the Bible not only speaks a great deal, but it speaks with great clarity
Sanctification whether in the Hebrew language of the Old Testament or in the Greek language of the New Testament means primarily separation
Gold is not holy in itself, but it is sanctified when it is placed in the temple , because the temple separates it unto God
The altar has separated some bulls or goats, the temple has separated some gold, and the saints' intercession has separated some food
Something which is common or ordinary may not be faulty or sinful, but it is not holy because it is not separated
A person may behave so well that in man's eyes he is irreproachable and perfect, yet he is still common, not holy
Although he is well-behaved, he is common, ordinary, not separated from the common, the ordinary; he is, therefore, not sanctified unto God
To be sanctified on the negative side is to be separated from all things other than God on the positive side it is to be separated unto God
Sanctification is to separate these common persons, matters, and things from everything outside of God that they may be unto God and of God
Christ offered Himself as the sacrifice to redeem us from our sins, shedding His blood to repurchase us , that we may be sanctified
If we desire to participate in this fact, we must believe into Him , that is, we must be joined to Him by faith
The sanctification we receive in God's salvation is of two aspects, positional sanctification and dispositional sanctification
We were forever sanctified at the time we were redeemed through Christ's offering of His body on the cross as the one sacrifice for sins
When Christ offered Himself to God, He took away our sin and accomplished the purification of sins once for all
God the Father is not only the source of the Sanctifier, but He is also the source of all who are being sanctified by Christ
Before His incarnation, Christ was the only begotten Son of God, having only the divine nature but not the human nature
When He was incarnated, on the one hand, He was still the only begotten Son of God; on the other hand, He put on human nature
Although the divine nature within Him was the Son of God, His human nature was not, because His human part was not yet born of God
According to 1 Corinthians 6:11, we have been sanctified not only in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but also in the Spirit of God
When we are joined to the Lord we experience the sanctifying work of the Spirit and receive the subjective sanctification in our disposition
The holy nature within responds to the sanctifying light without, and the sanctifying guidance without stimulates the holy taste within
To be holy, we must believe into Christ to participate in the fact that He has shed His blood to repurchase us that we may be sanctified
It is also accomplished by God's calling, which calls us out from among the worldly people, thus sanctifying us unto God Himself
Justification by grace is God's approving man by fulfilling for man freely all the requirements of His righteousness
God can justify us by His grace according to His righteousness that we may be justified according to His standard of righteousness
Acts 1339 says And from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses in this One everyone who believes is justified
If we do not believe, Christ and what He has done have nothing to do with us, and we still cannot be justified by God
We must be joined to Christ through faith; we must believe into Him and by faith receive Him and what He has done for us
Only then can we participate in Him and in His redemption, and only then can we be in Him and be justified through His redemption
Galatians 2:16b says, 'We also have believed in Christ Jesus that we might be justified by the faith of Christ'
When we are justified by Gods grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus and by believing into Christ we receive the righteousness of God
When we believe by the faith of Jesus Christ, we not only are justified by God, but we also receive the righteousness of God
Just as He is righteous before God and justified by God, so we are also righteous before God and justified by God in Him
The death of Christ fully fulfilled and satisfied Gods righteous requirements so that we may be fully justified by God through Christs death
Christ's resurrection was God's vindication and approval of His work, and it was also a sign of His universal success
His resurrection proves that His death has satisfied God forever, and that through His death God can fully justify us
Christ's ascending to the Father after His death and resurrection is also a proof of the believers' justification
Father God, Thou hast accepted Jesus as our Substitute; Judged the Just One for the unjust, Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?
As a proof of perfect justice, At Thine own right hand He sits; He, as Thy full satisfaction, Righteously Thy need befits
The redeeming death of Christ as the ground for God to justify us has been fully accepted by God and has fully satisfied God
We have been justified objectively, positionally, by God's grace, through the redemption of Christ Jesus, and by our faith
Outwardly, His blood brings us the objective justification; inwardly, His resurrection life brings us the subjective justification
God not only has the position outwardly to justify us, but He also can make us righteous by the resurrection life of Christ in us
To be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is to be in the person of Jesus Christ, that is, in Jesus Christ Himself
Corinthians 6:11 continues, 'You were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God'
When we have an organic union with Him in His name, we participate in and enjoy the resurrected Christ as life in the Spirit
We receive the objective justification freely by God's grace, through the redemption in Christ Jesus, and by our faith
Faith is the way for us to be justified, and our faith comes from Christ, who is the source, the cause, of our faith
When He enters into us to be our believing element and ability, this faith is reckoned to us as righteousness by God
We are justified subjectively by the divine life, by Christ in resurrection, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit
We are able to participate in and enjoy Him as our life that we may live out righteousness by Him and thereby be justified subjectively
Through Christs redemption we not only have been forgiven freed washed sanctified and justified but we also have been reconciled to God
Because of the fall, man not only is far off and alienated from God, but he also is at enmity with God in his mind by evil works
Man is at enmity with God in his heart, and, disapproving of God, he does not think it good to have God in his knowledge
Colossians 1:20 and 22 say, 'And through Him to reconcile all things to Him, having made peace through the blood of His cross
In order that we might be reconciled to Him, God accomplished a propitiatory way for us, which is the redemption of Christ
Christ died for our sins and shed His blood on the cross to accomplish redemption that we might be reconciled to God
In order that the world might be reconciled to Himself, God accomplished all the necessary steps of reconciliation through Christ
The first result of our reconciliation to God is that we have peace toward God ; that is, we are walking toward God on the way of peace
Romans 5:11 says, 'We also are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation'
When we are reconciled to God, have peace toward Him, enjoy Him, and boast in Him, we are being saved in His life
In 1 John 2:2 and 4:10 we are told that Christ, the Son of God, is Himself the propitiation concerning our sins
In both places the word propitiation in Greek is hilasmos, which means 'that which propitiates,' that is, a propitiatory sacrifice
make propitiation for' in Greek is hilaskomai, the verbal form of the noun hilasmos, meaning the action of propitiation
The foregoing verses clearly tell us that the Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins
The reason God forgives us, washes us, sanctifies us, justifies us, and reconciles us to Himself is that we may be regenerated
Our concept might have been that as long as we could be forgiven of our sins and be justified before God, we would have no problems
The fact is that man, whether good or evil, is from the flesh and of the flesh; hence, man needs to be regenerated
We need to be regenerated not only because our life is evil, but because our life is the life of the flesh, not the life of God
The Lord Jesus said that man must be born anew , for unless a man is born anew, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
Even if man had not been corrupted, man still would need to be regenerated that he may have God's life and correspond to God's nature
He understood correctly the literal sense of the words born anew but he appreciated incorrectly the significance of rebirth or regeneration
To be regenerated is to be born anew, but it does not mean to enter into the mother's womb and be born a second time
To be regenerated is to be born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God
In John 3:5 the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, 'Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God'
Regeneration is accomplished in the human spirit by the Holy Spirit of God with the divine life, the eternal, uncreated life of God
The Epistle of James tells us that God brought us forth according to His purpose, that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures
Grace is applied only to a worthy situation, but mercy reaches farther than grace, extending even to the unworthy ones
As the fallen and undeserving ones, we have been regenerated according to the purpose and mercy of God the Father
Through His resurrection from among the dead, the Lord Jesus accomplished only the objective fact of our regeneration
Not until the Holy Spirit comes to operate in us and applies the objective fact to us do we have the subjective experience of regeneration
When the Holy Spirit comes, He first convicts us concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment
Immediately following this, He causes us to believe in the gospel and to receive the Lord Jesus and what He has accomplished for us
Peter 1:23 says, 'Having been regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God'
In order to be regenerated, a person needs to believe, and he needs only to believe and not to do anything else
The word of truth is the word of the divine reality, of what the Triune God is , which word is the seed of life
Through regeneration God enlivens us with His life, bringing us into a relationship of life and nature, an organic union, with Him
It is not a hope of objective things, but a hope of life, even the eternal life, with all the endless divine blessings
Only this divine life can enable us to grow in life until we enter into the reality of the hope to which we were brought
Man needs regeneration because man is born of the flesh and is of the flesh, which is desperately wicked, incurable, and unchangeable
Only then can he correspond to God's nature and enter into the kingdom that matches God's nature, that is, the kingdom of God
We, the regenerated ones, not only have obtained the eternal life of God but also have received the Spirit to indwell us
He is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, the life-giving Spirit whom Christ became in resurrection
According to the revelation of Romans chapter eight, the Spirit of life is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and even Christ Himself
As Ephesians 1:13 and 14 tell us, we were sealed with the Holy Spirit unto the redemption of God's acquired possession
At the time of our regeneration, the Spirit as the seal was put into our spirit, and His sealing began within us
Eventually, even our body will be thoroughly sealed, that is, saturated and transfigured; that will be the redemption of our body
In John 14:17 the Lord Jesus clearly and definitely promised that when the Holy Spirit came He would indwell the disciples
On the night of His resurrection, He came into the midst of the disciples and breathed into them that they might receive the Holy Spirit
In the Old Testament age, God caused His Spirit to come and work only upon man outwardly; He did not cause His Spirit to dwell in man
He is not only the shining and enlightening light but also the very life which enlivens, nourishes, and strengthens us
When we believe into Christ, we receive eternal life in this age; we do not have to wait until the coming age or the eternal age
The divine life is the eternal life, and the eternal life is the divine life, the life which was from the beginning
What they reported was not some theology or doctrine but the divine eternal life which they saw and testified by their practical experiences
These two verses clearly indicate that God has given to us His life, the eternal life, as a free gift in Christ
Because God loved us, He put His life, the eternal life, in His Son and gave His life to us that we might receive it
When we believe in the Lord, immediately we have eternal life ; we do not need to wait even for one moment, much less until the future
John 5:13 says, 'I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God'
Our believing to receive eternal life is the fact; the words of the holy writings are the assurance concerning this fact
Both the Lord's hand as the hand of power and the Father's hand as the hand of love are for the believers' protection
When we receive the Holy Spirit, we receive Him as the essential Spirit for our existence, being, life, and living
As the Spirit of life, He continually imparts God's eternal life to us until our entire being is filled with Him
As the indwelling Spirit, He is settling down in us, making His home in us, and even occupying our whole being
As the reality of Christ, He brings us into all the reality of Christ so that all that Christ is and has may become real in us
Through the fall Satan entered into man with the satanic life , man became mixed and unclean, and he also became the old man
The washing of regeneration begins in us at the time of our regeneration, through which we obtain from God His life and nature
When we are delivered from our natural life and nature through God's divine life and nature, we are cleansed from all defilement
The divine elements of the new creation produce in us a metabolic change that causes the old and natural elements within us to be replaced
As the Firstborn of all creation , Christ died on the cross in the old creation, thus terminating the entire old creation
When Christ was crucified on the cross, the veil in the temple was rent from top to bottom , and the cherubim on it also were rent
It is in this wonderful Spirit, who is the resurrected Christ Himself, that we have been created into one new man
In the creation of the one new man, however, God's nature has been wrought into man to make His divine nature one entity with humanity
The Holy Spirit imparts God's essence into our being that we may become the new creation with God's life and nature
They were in a crooked and perverted generation and in an evil religious age , unable to know the grace of the gospel of Christ
How much they needed to be transferred out of these pitiful and tragic realms that they might enter into an entirely new sphere
It is of God's eternal will that the believers have been rescued out of the present evil age, the religious age
It is of Christ that the believers have been transferred from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God
Grace is Christ , that is, it is God in Christ becoming our life, our life power, and everything for us to enjoy
It is also of Christ that the believers have been delivered out of the religious age, which is evil and crooked, into Christ and the church
Christ gave Himself for man's sins that He might rescue man from the present evil age, that is, the religious world
Today the whole world lies in the evil one , and the people of the world are being manipulated and slaughtered by Satan as he wills
Because of God's deliverance, however, we have been transferred out of the authority of Satan that we may turn to God
Satan uses different aspects of his authority to control people, to lord it over them, and to keep them under his rule
Now we have been delivered out of the authority of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God's love
No one in the world whether Jew or Gentile is justified before God by law on the contrary everyone is bound condemned and cursed under law
Galatians 3:23 says, 'But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed'
In this grace the processed Triune God has become our life and everything that we may enjoy the Triune God as our life and life supply
The purpose of Christ's giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us, out of the Jewish religion, the present evil age
In his self he is entangled with the flesh and bound by the old man and he is even under the hand of Satan caught bound and oppressed by him
Now we will see the various aspects of the freedom that the believers enjoy after they have received God's salvation
Although people today greatly promote freedom and all like to enjoy freedom, they are under sin's domination and are without freedom
When Christ comes into us as life, He shines within us as light , which brings the divine element as reality into us
After we are saved, the Lord's salvation causes us to have the divine life, to be joined to the Lord, and to be crucified with Him
Christ has also brought us with Him into His resurrection that we may receive His life and enjoy God's grace forever
We are not under law but under grace ; that is, we are not being controlled under law, but we are enjoying freedom under grace
We are no longer under law as slaves to ordinances, bound by letters; we are under grace as sons in life, enjoying freedom in life
Since we have such a freedom, we are no longer under any kind of enslavement, much less under the domination of law
God's salvation sets us free not only from the law and its bondage but also from the labor and burden of the law
In Him we are circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands in the putting off of the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ
The flesh is the living out and the expression of the old man; that is, the flesh is our experience of the old man
Christ destroyed Satan through His death in the flesh on the cross , thus setting us free, releasing us, from Satan's hand
When we were sinners, we were held in Satan's kingdom of darkness, controlled and cruelly treated under his authority
Because man is born into the world, which is degraded and which renounces and even resists God, man is trapped in its snare and dominion
Since we have been joined to Christ by believing into Him, through our co-death with Him we have been rescued from the world
He saves us from the flesh and the old man so that we are no longer entangled with the flesh or encumbered with the old man
God's heart is love, and His heart so loved us 'that He gave us His only begotten Son' to prepare salvation for us
His love prepared salvation for us, while His mercy caused Him to bestow His salvation upon us, the undeserving ones
We were saved apart from our works; in fact, we were saved altogether according to God's grace, which came to us through the Lord Jesus
The source of our salvation is God's love, God's mercy, and God's grace, while the accomplishment of our salvation is by the Triune God
The Triune God Himself is the Accomplisher of our salvation; He is the One who completed the work of salvation
He passed through incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension, thus accomplishing an eternal redemption
In resurrection He brought us into a life relationship, an organic union, with God, that we might participate in all that God is and has
By enlightening and seeking man He sanctifies the fallen man unto the obedience of faith in Christ's redemption
God's calling is the first thing that God accomplishes in His chosen ones in the initial stage of His full salvation
When we believe into Christ we are redeemed that is we are forgiven of our sins freed washed sanctified justified and reconciled to God
As a result we who once belonged to God but became lost and who became Gods enemies because of our fall are recovered and accepted by God
By His grace, God has prepared and accomplished salvation for us; by our believing, we receive that which has been prepared and accomplished
When we believe into the Lord we believe in our heart in the Lord as our Savior when we confess we confess with our mouth the Lord as Lord
We must confess with our mouth before men in order to show forth the fact that we have believed into the Lord and are saved
If a person believes but is not baptized, he can receive only a partial salvation; he cannot receive the Lord's complete salvation
We are saved through Gods calling the Spirits sanctification Christs redemption our union with the Triune God and the Spirits regeneration
In order to be fully saved, we must pass through the complete step of believing, calling, confessing, and being baptized
Some people consider that it is impossible to know today that we are saved, while others think that after we are saved we may still perish
The Bible shows us, however, that our salvation is not a matter of speculation, nor is it a matter of uncertainty
The Bible clearly reveals that when a person believes he is forgiven of his sins freed washed sanctified justified and reconciled to God
John 1:12-13 clearly points out that anyone who believes in the Lord is born of God and becomes a child of God
As long as a man believes into the Lord Jesus he is regenerated he has Gods eternal life and he will not perish forever that is he is saved
As long as we believe, we have eternal life, and we are no longer condemned or judged; we have passed out of death into life
When a person intends to bequeath his possessions, he lists his possessions in a will and bequeaths them to the inheritor
A man receives a bequest according to the clear stipulations expressed in the will, not according to his own consideration or imagination
By the Spirit's inner witnessing with our spirit we can know with certainty that we are God's children and that we are saved
By the clear words of the Bible, by the sensation in our spirit, and by the experience of love, we can know with certainty that we are saved
John 4:10 says, 'In this is love, not that we have loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins'
Neither death nor life neither angels nor demons neither things present nor things to come shall be able to separate us from the love of God
Because of God's inseparable love, His salvation within us will never fail; it is forever secure and unchanging
Since God's calling comes out of His invariable being and is according to His unchanging will, it is irrevocable and unalterable
In John 10:29 the Lord said, 'My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand'
At the same time, this covenant is an eternal covenant , which will remain eternally and is effective eternally
Because God is faithful and is One who keeps His covenant , He will never break His covenant but will fulfill it in us accordingly
By offering Himself on the cross without blemish as the one sacrifice to God, Christ has accomplished an eternal redemption
No one can condemn us any longer , nor can anyone nullify the perfect, complete, and eternal redemption which Christ has accomplished for us
From that day, the life they lived was new, the way on which they walked was new, and all the things they did were new
God's forgiveness is based upon the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, and it is also the issue of our repentance and faith
At the moment God's salvation came to Zaccheus, it caused him to deal with his material possessions and to clear away his past sinful life
Because of our enjoyment of God's salvation, God's life in us causes us to have a change in our mood, taste, and feeling toward the world
If he desires to be a good Christian from now on and to follow and go on with the Lord, he has no choice but to close the casino
If he does not close it down, though we may not deny that he is saved, we may say that he has no way to live as a Christian
The clearance of the past is not according to the demand of outward regulations but according to the moving of the Spirit within
The Spirit will definitely require us by the holy life within us to remove all demonic and dirty things and to cut off the old way of living
In 1 Thessalonians 1:9 Paul said that, after they had believed in the Lord, the Thessalonians turned away from idols
Today, especially in places like China and Japan, most of the unbelieving families have idols or things pertaining to idols
Among the Chinese, there are things related to the reading of facial features, fortune-telling, horoscopes, and divination
It is improper for a believer who has been baptized to have idols or other superstitious things remaining in his home
Not only should we discard the idols that are obvious, but we should reject even the idols that are not obvious
These pictures represent human superstitions, and in the eyes of God they are blasphemous; hence, they should be disposed of
We should use our spirit to worship the Lord, who is Spirit ; we should not use our physical body to worship a visible image
Acts 19:19 tells us that the Ephesian believers who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them
Other examples are gambling instruments, utensils for alcoholic drinking, pipes for smoking, obscene books, and pornographic pictures
In brief, anything related to idols and any demonic and filthy thing, however valuable it may be, should be burned
The Bible, records, in particular, that the price of the items which were burned by the Ephesians was fifty thousand pieces of silver
A third example of the clearance of the past is seen in the case of Zaccheus, in his restoring of what he owed others
If your making the matter known to him will not benefit everyone involved, then you may restore what you owe in secret
If the person you have wronged is no longer alive, in principle you should reimburse his nearest relative, such as his wife or children
We must try to do the most suitable thing by carefully weighing the situation and following the leading of the Holy Spirit
In brief, the restoration of material things should be done with much discretion because it often involves others
We must handle the matter of making restitution according to this principle so that no damage will be done to anyone
Since regeneration causes a new life to be imparted into us, spontaneously it also ushers us into a new living
The old way of living is terminated with the old life, and the new way of living is germinated with the new life
They can rid themselves of all entanglements and remove all the weights that they may press forward on the way of the Lord
Anyone who does not allow the Spirit to do a proper work in him in these matters cannot go on with the Lord in a proper way
We must look to the Lord for the supply of grace that we may clear up things more thoroughly, until we are full of life and peace
At this time we must again follow the leading of this feeling and deal with these matters until we again sense life and peace
If we would let the Spirit work in us, He will lead us to make the clearance and carry out the dealings by the power of life within
We must thoroughly make such a clearance and carry out such dealings until we are inwardly filled with life and peace
