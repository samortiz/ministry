   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Genuine Tongues Being a Dialect</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Pentecostal Christianity, reacting to the deadness of fundamental Christianity, cares mainly for the gifts, especially tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I spoke in tongues more than thirty-five years ago, but after carefully studying the Bible concerning this matter, I dropped this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By looking into the Bible with a Greek-English interlinear text, I discovered that the word tongue is two words in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is either glossa, referring to the speaking organ or a dialect, or dialektos, meaning "dialect."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Tongues and dialect are used interchangeably in Acts 2:4, 6, 8, and 11.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, some people speak in tongues by uttering nonsensical syllables or by repeating the same syllables over and over.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since they realize that these sounds are not a real dialect, they say that the tongue they are speaking is an unknown dialect or an angelic dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, even the most simple dialect is composed of more than a few sounds.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1936 I became very involved with tongue-speaking, but as a student of the Bible I could not get through in my understanding of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time I spoke with a certain leading one in the Assembly of God, who came to China from the west coast of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was over sixty years old and was supposed to be a scholar in Greek and in knowing the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our conversation, he told me that glossa does not necessarily mean a dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I then opened to Acts 2 and showed him that tongues and dialect are used interchangeably.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I asked him to reconcile his teaching for me, but he could not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, he put his hands on my head and said, "Your head is too big."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With that he ended our conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was also the end of my tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1963 a new movement of tongue-speaking was very prevailing along the west coast of the United States under the leadership of a certain Episcopalian priest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This movement published a paper in Los Angeles called Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In an editorial on the first page of one issue, the writer said that he had contacted two hundred tongue-speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without exception, all two hundred doubted that their speaking in tongues was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Still, because the writer was one hundred percent for tongue-speaking, he encouraged everyone to speak in tongues and not to doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you believe that Peter and the others doubted their experience of speaking in tongues on the day of Pentecost?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must see through the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we ask a linguist to analyze a recording of man-made speaking in tongues, he will verify that it is false.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, after someone speaks in tongues, someone else may interpret it, saying, "My people, time is short; I am coming quickly."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, in the evening the same tongue may be spoken and interpreted as, "Be on the alert; there will be an earthquake."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The children of God should not be so foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1963 I was invited to San Diego by a group of people who spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While I was there, one of the leaders turned to another Chinese brother and me and said, "Praise the Lord, God has given me the grace to speak Chinese!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He tried to speak something in Chinese, and then he turned to me to see whether or not I understood it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I said, "Brother, I'm sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I did not understand one word you spoke."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then he began to speak again, uttering some sounds in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Again, he turned to me, and I said, "I still do not understand anything."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He tried a third time, but the other brother and I still could not understand what he uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I told him, "I speak Mandarin and this brother speaks Cantonese.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Between the two of us, we know the main dialects of Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot speak many of them, but we still can recognize them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we cannot understand one word of your speaking."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His was a man-made tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Later, in one of the meetings of that congregation, an American woman in her fifties stood up and spoke a short sentence in a so-called tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then a young American-born Chinese of about twenty years of age stood and interpreted her short tongue-speaking with a long interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After the meeting, as a guest in the leader's home, I asked him if he thought that the interpretation by the young Chinese man was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He said, "No, I do not believe that it was genuine."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Two years later in Waco, Texas I met the young Chinese man who did the interpretation in San Diego.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I asked him about his interpretation of the tongue-speaking, he admitted that it was not a real interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I can tell you many stories like this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am not speaking something that I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have passed through these things, and I realize the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do believe that there are genuine tongues today, but many so-called tongues spoken today are only human-manufactured tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 1964 I was invited to dinner at the home of a brother who held a doctorate in physics.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He shared with me his testimony about how he began to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He said that he spoke in tongues by exercising his jaw and turning his tongue a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then I responded by saying, "Brother, do you believe that on the day of Pentecost Peter turned his jaw a certain way?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After listening to his testimony, I realized that under the Lord's mercy what I had experienced was much better than this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because this brother was trained in a certain way by his denomination, he exercised his jaw and turned his tongue to make a strange sound which he call a tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, there is no need to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without doing this we can enjoy the Lord's grace much more than he did.</S>
