   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PSALM 92 THE RESULTS OF TAKING GOD AS OUR DWELLING PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 92 shows the result of taking God as our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we and the Lord Jesus take God as our home, the issue firstly is that we will sing praises.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High" v. 1 . Only by dwelling in God, by taking God as our habitation, and by letting His beauty be upon us, can we be filled with His praises.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the first result.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second result is indicated in verse 4: "For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must put Psalm 90:17 together with this verse: "Establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By combining these two portions, we see that to dwell in God as our habitation causes us to realize what the work of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Continuing in Psalm 92, we read, "O Lord, how great are thy works!" v. 5 . Just to preach the gospel, just to open a mission field, just to pass on some chapters and verses to others and help them to be spiritual is not the great work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The great work of God is to restore the desolated building of God and to recover the sons of Korah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The great work of God today is firstly to recover the local churches, and secondly to recover so many of you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many of us are the real sons of Korah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's great work is to recover the things desolated by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only by dwelling in His house can we realize this work in all its greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of you have been in the mission field.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you still appreciate the mission field work?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You must realize something deeper, something greater.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the house of God we may clearly see what are truly the great works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of the wild ox: I shall be mingled with fresh oil." v. 10 . So many dear ones who have come into the local churches have experienced their horn being exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before we came to dwell in the churches, we were indeed low and frequently defeated; but when we came into God's dwelling place, we sensed that our horn was exalted over our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Formerly, we were afraid of this and afraid of that, but after we came into the local churches, we said, "Hallelujah, our horns have been exalted!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We felt then that we were mingled with fresh oil not only anointed with oil, but mingled with it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word for "anointed" in verse 10 King James Version is the same as that in Leviticus 2:4 for "mingled" "unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In God's house, dwelling in God as our habitation, we have a daily sense of such a mingling with fresh oil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you have this kind of feeling?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Day by day I sense something so fresh, not just as water, but as oil, being mingled with me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes people ask how I could be so fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is because I am being daily mingled with fresh oil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God is our habitation in the local churches, we are like palms and cedars, so stately and secure, planted in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Have you been planted?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are planted, we are bound; it is not easy for us to move.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But it is here that we flourish.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and green" v. 14 . We flourish to such an extent that even when we are old, we still bring forth fruit; we are full of sap and green.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only by taking God and the local church as our habitation can we do this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God and the local church as our habitation are not two separate things, but one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are truly dwelling in the local church, we are certainly dwelling in God; and if we are one with God, surely we are dwelling in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we are planted in the divine habitation, flourishing in the courts of our God, and bringing forth fruit even in old age, full of song and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The longer we dwell here, the younger we become.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the result of dwelling in God, and this is Psalm 92.</S>
