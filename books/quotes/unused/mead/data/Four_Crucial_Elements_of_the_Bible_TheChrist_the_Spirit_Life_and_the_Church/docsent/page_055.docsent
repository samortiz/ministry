   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church in the Epistles</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Epistles, especially in Ephesians, the apostle Paul gives a detailed explanation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He tells us that the church is what God planned in eternity, what God is after in His heart's desire; it was God's plan in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before the creation of the heavens and the earth, in eternity past, God had a heart's desire, a good pleasure, to gain a group of people as a corporate Body to be His vessel that He may be its life and may dwell in it so that this corporate Body may become His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This corporate Body is one entity with Him; He is the life of this corporate Body, and this corporate Body is His outward living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a corporate Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ, the Savior, is the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Head with the Body, that is, Christ with the church, is the one great complete person in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ as the Head is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, the Head of this great, universal, complete person is the Triune God, and the Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If someone would stand before us without a head, we would consider him to be a monster.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we see a headless body making gestures, we would definitely be terrified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is unfortunate that of the Jews, the Gentiles, the Catholic Church, and many in Christianity, very few know that the Triune God is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the New Testament dispensation, the Triune God has become the Head of the Body, and His redeemed people are the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God as the Head and His redeemed people as the Body are not like parts of a puppet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A puppet's head is something fastened to its body; it may be removed at any time and replaced by another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the Triune God as the Head of the church is not something fastened to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, this Head, as the head of a real person, is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Ephesians Paul covers the church in a very thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Chapter one says that the church is the Body of Christ; chapter two, that the church is the dwelling place of God; chapter three, that the church is the fullness of God; chapter four, that the church as the Body of Christ is a new man; chapter five, that the church, the new man, is a bride, a counterpart, a wife; and chapter six, that the church is a warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Ephesians Paul covers the church in its aspects as the Body, the dwelling place, the fullness, the new man, the bride, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul speaks not only concerning the inner being of the church but also of the outward expression of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Titus 1:5 says, "For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might appoint elders in every city, as I directed you."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we compare this verse with Acts 14:23, we can see that the jurisdiction of a local church is the city in which it is located and that in one city there should be only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The eldership of a local church should pertain to the entire city in which that church is located.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such a unique presbytery in a city preserves the unique oneness of the Body of Christ from damage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This practice is an absolute prerequisite for the maintaining of the proper order in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Church in Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul was martyred soon after he wrote the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After approximately twenty-five years, among the apostles of the first generation, only the aged John was still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was the last one to pass away among the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In writing the book of Revelation, he points out at the beginning that the church in each locality is a golden lampstand, that each lampstand bears not one lamp but seven lamps, and that within the lamps there is the shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In figure, the golden lampstand signifies the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, the nature of the golden lampstand is pure gold, and in typology gold signifies the Father's glorious nature and life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Next, the golden lampstand is not simply a piece of solid gold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, the gold is beaten into the shape of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This signifies that Christ as the embodiment of God the Father became a man and passed through sufferings and trials for the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, each lampstand bears seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation tells us clearly that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, in Revelation the golden lampstand signifies the church as the embodiment of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That the church is the embodiment of the Triune God corresponds with Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of one Body and one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that the church is the mingling of the Triune God with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This corresponds with the golden lampstands in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is the Triune God completely mingled with His redeemed people as one to become a golden lampstand shining locally to express God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When this expression is manifested, it is the testimony of Jesus Rev 1:2, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the end of Revelation, when the new heaven and the new earth come, their center is a golden mountain, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Upon this mountain is the throne of God, on which are God and the Lamb, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God is the light and Christ is the lamp 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, the New Jerusalem is a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Ultimately, the New Jerusalem is an aggregate lampstand with Christ as the lamp and God as the light shining out from the golden mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the ultimate consummation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the beginning of Revelation, the church is expressed as many lampstands in different localities, with one lampstand for each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the consummation of the church in its manifestation in eternity, all the lampstands are gathered together as the unique, universal lampstand, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Genesis 2 we see Eve as a type of the church being the counterpart of Adam as a type of Christ, and in Revelation 21 we see the bride of the Lamb as the New Jerusalem v. 2 . In the Old Testament we see the tabernacle and the temple as types of the church, and in Revelation we see the New Jerusalem, the consummation of the church, as the tabernacle and the temple 21:3, 22 . This is the church revealed in the entire Bible.</S>
