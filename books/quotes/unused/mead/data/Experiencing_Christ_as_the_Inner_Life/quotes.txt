[1]  CHAPTER ONE OUR NEED TO KNOW THE INNER LIFE Scripture Reading: Gal 2:20; John 10:10b; 1 John 1:2; John 1:4; Rom 8:2; Heb 8:10-11; 10:16; Jer 31:32-34
[2]  In recent months, the Lord has arranged for me to visit many groups of Christians of various backgrounds.
[3]  After all these visits, I realize that believers today have a need for the real knowledge and experience of the inner life, a life which is Christ Himself.
[4]  According to my realization, exceedingly few brothers and sisters know what life is, fewer have the real experience of life, and nearly no one knows the right way to experience the inner life.
[5]  As we progress through these chapters, let us pray to receive a definite and much needed vision by which we can both see and experience the central matter of the Christian faith, the Scriptures, and the Christian life Christ as our inner life.
[6]  However, very few believers have the central concept that in addition to these things, we have received God Himself as life.
[7]  I am afraid that although many of you enjoy peace, joy, rest, and satisfaction, you do not know that God, who is life, is now living within you.
[8]  We also know that the Lord said, He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me v. 57b . But who knows the way to eat Christ? Although we know that Christ is the bread of life, many of us do not know how to eat Christ.
[9]  AND THE LIGHT OF LIFE Scripture Reading: John 1:4; 14:19-20; 6:57; 1 John 5:12; Col 3:4; Gal 2:20a; John 8:12; 1 John 1:1-7a
[10]  In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
[11]  If we are in the fellowship of this life, we are in fellowship with God, and if we are in fellowship with God, we are in the fellowship with the light.
[12]  I have a very heavy burden that you who love the Lord would realize the proper way to experience Christ as the inner life.
[13]  You may know that Christ is life to you, and you may know that Christ lives within you.
[14]  You may know all these things, but the truth of the matter is that it is rather difficult for me to help you realize the proper way to experience Christ as the inner life in a very real and practical way.
[15]  If you are going to experience the inner life, Christ Himself as the divine life, you have to know what the fellowship of this life is.
[16]  When you have the flow of life, you will have joy.
[17]  When I see you with a long face instead of a shining face, I know that you have lost the inward flow.
[18]  If we allow the fellowship of the divine life to flow in us, that is, if we allow the fire to burn in us, this proves that we are living in Christ and taking Christ as our life practically.
[19]  THE LIGHT OF LIFE The Shining of the Light of Life
[20]  Not only do we need the fellowship of life; we need to experience the light of life.
[21]  Whereas the fellowship of life is the current, the flow, of Christ as life within us, the light of life is the shining of the divine life within us.
[22]  Our having the flow of life and the shining and ruling of light within is proof that we are living by Christ, that we are in Christ, and that we are taking Christ as our life.
[23]  Jeremiah 31:33 says, But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.
[24]  The old law reveals to us that God is love, that God is holy, that God is righteous, and that God is a God of light, but the new law is the very God of love, holiness, righteousness, and light coming into us to be love, holiness, righteousness, and light to us.
[25]  THE ISSUE OF THE LAW OF LIFE S INNER REGULATION
[26]  The issue of this inner regulation of the law of life is that we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ Rom 8:2, 29 .
[27]  Every day, every hour, in all things, and in every place, this living law, which is God in Christ as the Spirit, is regulating us.
[28]  This law is a living law, and it is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit the Triune God.
[29]  Because God in Christ as the Spirit is life and the living law that regulates us from within, if we truly live by Christ, we will take care of the inner regulating.
[30]  We also saw that Jeremiah says that God will put His law into our inward parts and write His law in our hearts.
[31]  Because both the Lord and the law of life are life John 11:25; Col 3:4 , we can say that the Lord Himself is the law of life.
[32]  While it is true that the law of life was put into us at the time of our regeneration, if we do not have the proper experiences, we will not have the law of life written into us.
[33]  Answer: Spiritually speaking, we received both the infilling of the Holy Spirit within us and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon us at the beginning of our spiritual experience, our regeneration.
[34]  For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread, and having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me. Similarly also the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord s death until He comes.
[35]  Hence, when we come to the Lord s table and take the bread, we must have the clear realization that the bread signifies, on the one hand, that the Lord s physical body was crucified on the cross that we may have Him as our life and, on the other hand, that we all who have received Christ as our life are the Lord s mystical Body.
[36]  Whenever we come to the Lord s table, we must keep two words in mind.
[37]  The cup we drink is the fellowship of the blood of Christ, and the bread we break is the fellowship of the Body of Christ 10:16 .
[38]  If we have such an assurance and such a realization, as often as we come to the Lord s table, we will have the boldness to testify, Lord, I am here proclaiming, declaring, and testifying that You are my life, that I live by You, and that I am one with my dear brothers and sisters as one Body.
[39]  The Lord s table is profound, universally great, mysterious, and very meaningful, for in it we have the central thought of God and the eternal purpose of God: that God gave His Son to us as life so that we would live by Christ and become the members of His Body.
[40]  CHAPTER SIX THE ANOINTING Scripture Reading: Heb 8:10-11; 1 John 2:27; Acts 16:6-7
[41]  In the previous chapters, we covered our need to experience Christ as the inner life, particularly as regards the fellowship of life, the light of life, and the law of life with its inner regulation.
[42]  For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them.
[43]  In addition to having these laws within us, we as the people of God have no need that anyone teach us or that we teach anyone to know the Lord.
[44]  Whereas the law of life is the divine life, which is Christ Himself living within us and regulating us from within, the anointing is the working of the Triune God within us.
[45]  Hence, as believers, we must pay attention to two things: the first is the inner regulating of the law of the divine life, which is God Himself in Christ as life, and the second is the inner anointing, which is the working of the Holy Spirit within us.
[46]  How then can we know the inner anointing in a practical way?
