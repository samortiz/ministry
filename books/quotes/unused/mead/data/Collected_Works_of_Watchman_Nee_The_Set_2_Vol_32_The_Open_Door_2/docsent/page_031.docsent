   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A List of Saints Still Remaining in Hankow</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Omitted</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A List of Saints Who Have Left Hankow</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Omitted</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although some brothers and sisters are still in a state of transition and flux and some are still in the midst of stormy winds and threatening waves, we must still thank the Lord with all of our hearts for 1 His care and protection and 2 the propagation of the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to sing, "Praising You for what is past and trusting You for what is in the future."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This issue is still being published and mailed from Hankow, because Hankow is centrally located among the mail routes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If Hankow is in danger, we do not know where we will move; we are still waiting for the Lord's guidance!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If your mail cannot reach us and you do not know where we are, please forward your mail to either Hong Kong or Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are sending money, please mail it to Chungking only, because the exchange rate in Hong Kong may cause some loss.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you are sending mail through someone else, please take care of the following:</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Postal Rule No. 144 says that no mail should contain any correspondence to anyone other than the residents of the address and others living in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Old letters and old postcards are not affected by this rule.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please write on the envelope the name of the person the letter is addressed to.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, if you want to send a letter to Ruth Lee via Hong Kong, you should write on the envelope that it is for Ruth Lee in care of Mr. Ho Nai-yee in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If three persons live together in a house and you are writing to one of them, you can include letters to the other two in the same envelope.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course it is better to write the names of the other two on the envelope as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if two of them live in another house, even though they are in Chungking, their letters must be sent in separate envelopes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a few persons write to one person, it is alright to put all the letters in one envelope.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are to abide by the postal rule, we have to spend a little more time and money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you live far from Chungking, the mail will take time, and you should send your letter by air mail.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Recently we received an air mail letter from two brothers, Hwei Dian-chen and Lee Yi-tse in northern Kiangsu who told us that the post office can handle money under a hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to praise the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From the letter of Brother Ho Chi-chen of Tai-Ho County of Anhwei, we know that the brothers and sisters in Shu County are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Ruth Lee</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mountain village in Wan County,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>July 28, 1938</S>
