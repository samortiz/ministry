<p>Since October 1984 I have returned to Taiwan many times, but instead of my burden decreasing, it has increased with each visit. I am filled with hope for Taiwan, and I have faith that the &ldquo;gospelizing&rdquo; and &ldquo;truthizing&rdquo; of Taiwan is not a dream. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be successful in Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CALLING PEOPLE TO JOIN THE LORD&rsquo;S ARMY</h2>
<p>Many brothers and sisters are willing to offer themselves for the present move in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. They are joining the Lord&rsquo;s army; they are enrolled in &ldquo;Calvary&rsquo;s hosts&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #473). This work is not what is commonly called a revival work in Christianity. The Lord is calling us to enroll in Calvary&rsquo;s hosts, that is, to give everything for His recovery. We must spend our time, strength, and money, and we must give our spirit, soul, and body, our entire being.</p>
<p>The most important thing in an army is the morale of the troops. The highest demand with regard to the morale is that the soldiers have no opinions. Everyone in an army must put aside his individual thoughts and views and have one heart and one mind. Then they can be in oneness without any differing opinions or goals.</p>
<p>In the past we stressed the truth that the ministry is for the churches but that the churches are not for the ministry. However, the churches need to be in one accord with the ministry. If the churches are not in one accord with the ministry, the ministry has no way to build up the churches or to fight for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. When we say that the ministry is for the churches, we mean that the ministry builds up the churches; the ministry does not build up itself. When we say that the churches are not for the ministry, we mean that the churches are not for the building up of the ministry. However, this does not mean that the churches should not be in one accord with the ministry.</p>
<p>For example, every country needs an army, but the army is not for itself; the army is for the country. However, the country must supply and support the army. Whoever is of military age in a country should fulfill his military service and be in one accord with the army. Then the army will be able to fight for the country. In addition, every citizen must be in one accord with the army and support it even if he cannot join the army. In this way all the citizens can be for the army. In the same way the churches must be in one accord with the ministry, supporting the ministry and being for the ministry.</p>
<p>We are not calling the entire church to join the army. This is a call for a group of brothers and sisters to fight for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The result of their fighting is for the churches, not the ministry. Whatever the ministry does is for the churches. The ministry builds up the churches in every locality. Today the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has more than six hundred churches all over the earth, and they are all supplied by the ministry.</p>
<p>I came to Taiwan in 1984 to establish a model for the building up and spread of the church. The brothers in America learned about this and wanted to copy what we were doing. I told them that copying is useless and that being in one accord is the most important matter. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He fed more than five thousand people and helped thousands of people. But after His resurrection He appeared only to over five hundred brothers (1 Cor. 15:5-8). In Acts 1 there were one hundred twenty people praying in the upper room. These ones were in the Lord&rsquo;s army. They were not afraid of the threats from the Jewish leaders, and they prayed in one accord for the Lord&rsquo;s move. They did not have any opinions; they simply prayed in one accord for ten days. Previously they had differing opinions and argued (Mark 9:34), but in Acts 1, Peter and the sons of thunder, James and John, no longer contended. They prayed earnestly in one accord to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ELIMINATING CONTROL AND<br />
THE FREEDOM TO DO WHAT ONE PLEASES</h2>
<p>In the degradation of the church the Roman Catholic Church formed a huge religious organization in which the pope occupies the top position and controls everything. Later Martin Luther brought in the Reformation. This promoted an atmosphere of freedom, but it also created a scattered and divided situation. Christianity is still filled with this atmosphere. Christians say that they do not accept human control and justify this by saying that they are following the Holy Spirit. Everyone supposedly follows the leading of the Holy Spirit, but the result is that every person has a different leading. This situation can be compared to the situation in Israel during the age of the judges; everyone did what was right in his own eyes because they did not have a king (Judg. 21:25).</p>
<p>Since the time that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was raised up, we have rejected control because it is not found in the Bible. The first twelve chapters of Acts show that Peter took the lead during the first stage of the church. During the second stage of the church, Acts 13 through 28, Paul took the lead. Even though Peter and Paul did not control anything, Timothy and Titus, Paul&rsquo;s co-workers, did not have the so-called freedom to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. When Paul exhorted Timothy &ldquo;to remain in Ephesus,&rdquo; Timothy remained in Ephesus (1 Tim. 1:3). When Paul said to Titus, &ldquo;Be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis,&rdquo; Titus came to Nicopolis (Titus 3:12). This is not the situation today; instead, people say, &ldquo;Even though you want me to go, I must pray to see how the Holy Spirit leads me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First Corinthians 16:12 is a special case. In this verse Paul says, &ldquo;Concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.&rdquo; Paul fervently hoped that Apollos would go and help the Corinthians resolve their problems, but Apollos said that he did not desire to go at that time. This was Apollos&rsquo;s opinion. Timothy and Titus, however, were in one accord with Paul and did not do things in this way. Apollos was also a co-worker, but he was not one with Paul; he had his own views and feelings. This shows that the situation in the early church was not clear. Acts 18:24 clearly says that Apollos was an eloquent man and that he was powerful in the Scriptures. First Corinthians 3:6 says that Paul planted and Apollos watered. This one who could expound the Scriptures and teach others did not follow the Spirit to be one with the leading co-worker. This caused some believers in the church in Corinth to say that they were of Paul and others to say that they were of Apollos (v. 4).</p>
<p>We must be one of Gideon&rsquo;s three hundred skilled warriors. We must not say Amen when things are peaceful but when the battle begins, say that we need to reconsider because it is not convenient. When we were in mainland China, many people said, &ldquo;Brother Nee, we want to follow your leading.&rdquo; They read all the books published by Brother Nee, but when they gave messages, they spoke their own words. They did not pay any attention to what Brother Nee spoke. Brother Nee could not do anything about this. If we want to succeed in the work, we must be in one accord.</p>
<p>Paul had a group of co-workers who walked and moved in the same step with him. They were in one soul, not merely in one spirit (2 Cor. 12:18; Phil. 1:27). In Romans Paul says that the believers should glorify God with one accord with one mouth (15:6). In 1 Corinthians he beseeches the brothers to &ldquo;speak the same thing&rdquo; (1:10). This means that if the believers could not speak the same thing, it was best for them not to speak. In Ephesians 4:3 Paul, speaking of the oneness in reality, exhorts the Ephesian believers to be &ldquo;diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.&rdquo; In Romans, 1 Corinthians, and Philippians Paul speaks of the practical one accord.</p>
<p>Being one in heart and in soul, thinking the same thing, and speaking the same thing are the foundation for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Many Christians hope to obtain the outpouring, the baptism, of the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit is never poured out upon individual members. The Holy Spirit is poured out upon the Body of Christ so that the Lord can obtain an army to fight for Him. The one hundred twenty believers in Jerusalem were in one accord, continuing steadfastly in prayer (Acts 1:14), and the result was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p>
