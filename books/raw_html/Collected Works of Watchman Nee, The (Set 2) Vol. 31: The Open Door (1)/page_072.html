<h2 class="head2">Wenchow, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Greetings to Mr. X:</p><p>I received the money you wired from the bank. I know how you want to use it. I also know that the brothers and sisters in Shanghai have all been kept in safety by the Father. I really thank the Lord for His grace. Thank God for His overflowing grace in remembering a small one like myself. I also thank you for your love. May the Lord remember it much and repay you. I have been healed by God, and my sickness is gone. However, my body is still weak and needs rest and recovery. The situation has been kept in peace by God's gracious protection. Please do not worry about us. Peace in the Spirit!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Pan Huo-ling<br />February 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Li-Shui, Chekiang Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to my beloved Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>I met Miss Tso Guo-ying in the Jinhua Gospel Hospital on December 26. She said that she and some of her colleagues planned to go to Nan-ch'ang, because the hospital was closing. Miss Tso came to my home before she left for Nan-ch'ang the next day. I asked her if she needed anything. She said no. She boarded the train that day for Nan-ch'ang. I trust that she is safe now. I left Jin-Hwa on January 1 and came to Li-Shui. I have permission to use the new China Inland Mission Chapel (which has never been used). I am living in the dormitory of the mission's elementary school. Brother Hu Jeng-dao and I share a room and are very comfortable. The air is better than in Jin-Hwa, and I have more time to pray quietly before our Father. Thank the Father for His preparation. There are several missionaries from the China Inland Mission who are Westerners. They are all German. Pastor Chui, his wife, and two sons are also here in Li-Shui. The female doctors are all very godly. Pastor Chui is more than seventy years old. Mr. Chiu, Si Meng-yu, Chang Ming-jing, Chang Hao-ran, and Mrs. Chang are all here. We remembered the Lord on January 9 in Mr. Chiu's house. There were seven people there. Mr. Chiu has borrowed the office of the China Inland Mission's elementary school for his business, so he is very close to us. It is as if we are in one place. My family is still in Pai-Tou. Dr. Ruan, Brother Ah-lai and his wife, Huang Tsai-ch'ing, and Brother Lee Kwei-sien have all stayed in Hangchow and have not come out. May the Lord keep and protect them. May He also provide them with what they need. We are unable to communicate with them by letter. I heard that Miss Miao has already returned to Shanghai. Brother Yang-teh is still working at the Mei-Fu Company in Shanghai. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Di-sheng<br />January 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to my brother in the Lord, Mr. Luan:</p><p>When this war started, God said to me, "I am watching over them for evil" (Jer. 44:27). I was very frightened at that time. However, God showed me that believers and unbelievers should be different when they are faced with the same environment. While believers lose something in tribulation, they also gain something. There are many commandments and promises in the Bible that are now being fulfilled richly in the believers. These are things that we could not have gained in the days past. While I was praying for peace in this region, God said, "The time for the lovers of the Lord to be taken up to heaven is almost here." Works of power will be with us daily, as you once said. The Lord's love during the past months has been more than words can describe. If God gives me the opportunity, I will tell you about them in detail. I left Hangchow and passed through Fu-Yang, Tung-Lu, Jien-Teh, Lan-Si, Jin-Hwa, Yung-Kang, and Tsin-Yun; I am now in Li-Shui. During the first half of the year, I knew when I prayed that I would leave Ching Po High School. I asked the principal to release me, but he would not. After the war approached Hangchow, I came with Mr. Chiu to this place. I am now in the Chung-Teh Elementary School of Jesus Chapel, Tai-Shan-Gung Alley, Li-Shui. My wife and Samuel are in Sheng County. In my prayer and through the outward circumstances, I became clear that I should go to Kweichow. God keeps pointing to Sinkiang, Tibet, Tsinghai, and Kweichow, where the gospel has not been fully preached. God will not give the latter rains from heaven until the gospel has been preached to the ends of the earth. Christ's second coming is near. Perhaps we will not pass through the grave. The time has come for the church to be one.</p><p>I still marvel at the last conference in Hangchow. Everyone shed tears on the last day. These tears were shed because Hangchow was to pass through tribulation. Only Christ is Lord. The believers will all be tested so that they will all give up the things of the earth to gain the things in heaven. Allow me to tell you what is on my heart. Sometimes I do not know why God wants me to go where He sends me. I have asked the Lord why I must pass through the tribulation. There have been two times when I could have died in the past. One of those times I could have died painlessly without any worry. Thank God for answering me. I must finish the course God has set for me. In the future I will clothe myself with thanksgiving and crown myself with praise so that all the people I know will know how God has graced me. May the Lord come soon so that we will all see and hear Him! Hsu Tseng-rong is in Chou-Jia-Pu. Tao Chun-yen and the others are in Hu-Shu. Lee Kwei-sien is in Si-Wen-Che. Lou Chuan-en is in Sheng County. Yu Hung-fei is in Ju-Jih. Dong Tsen-teh is in Hankow. David Hsu is traveling back and forth between Wu-Yih and Jin-Hwa.</p><p>Humbly yours,<br />Si Meng-yu<br />December 5</p><p>(The meetings in Hangchow are now in Brother Ruan Chi-yu's home&mdash;Philip. Brother Ma Di-sheng sent a postcard from Li-Shui to the brothers in Hankow saying that Brothers Si and Chiu went with Brother Chang Ming-jing to Kiangsu. He does not know where they are now&mdash;Editor.)</p>
