<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The House of David Becoming Stronger,<br>and the House of Saul Becoming Weaker</H2><P>The war between the house of Saul and the house of David was long. The house of David became continually stronger, and the house of Saul became continually weaker (3:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. David Begetting Six Sons<br>of Six Wives, Respectively, in Hebron</H2><P>David begot six sons of six wives, respectively, in Hebron (vv. 2-5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Abner Rebelling against Ish-bosheth</H2><P>While there was war between the house of David and the house of Saul, Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul. He went in to Saul's concubine, but he was checked by Ish-bosheth, and rebelled against him (vv. 6-11). Abner said to Ish-bosheth, "May God do so to Abner, and even more, if I do not do for David as Jehovah has sworn to him; to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba!" (vv. 9-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Abner Appealing to David</H2><P>Abner appealed to David, asking him to make a covenant with him. David said that he would make a covenant with him, and then he requested Abner to bring Saul's daughter Michal his wife to him (vv. 12-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Abner Persuading the Elders<br>of Israel to Take David as Their King</H2><P>Abner persuaded the elders of Israel to take David as their king (vv. 17-21). He told them that Jehovah had spoken of David, saying, "By My servant David I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies" (v. 18). David held a feast for Abner and for the men who were with him, and Abner said to David, "I will rise up and go and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you and that you may reign over all that your soul desires" (v. 21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Joab Not Agreeing with David<br>concerning Abner's Appeal to David</H2><P>Joab did not agree with David concerning Abner's appeal to David. Joab killed Abner by plotting to avenge himself of Abner's killing his brother Asahel (vv. 22-27).</P>
