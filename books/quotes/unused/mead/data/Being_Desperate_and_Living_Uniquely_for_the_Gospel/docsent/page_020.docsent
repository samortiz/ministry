   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CUTTING OFF THE OLD WAY OF CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY GETTING INTO THE LORD'S NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The hundred and twenty in Acts got the authority and received power when the Holy Spirit came upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This qualified and equipped them to go.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They went, and great things happened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But following this the church became degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Degradation binds and restricts the resurrected and ascended Christ from accomplishing His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nearly everything revealed in the New Testament got bound, restricted and even killed over many centuries until the Reformation with Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even Luther, though, did not get away from the background and the surrounding influence of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the Lord raised up the so-called mystics in the 1600s such as Madam Guyon, Father Fenelon, and Brother Lawrence in the Catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Following this in the 1700s Zinzendorf was raised up and he practiced the church life to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That was a great improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the same time John Wesley was raised up as an individual giant to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then in the next century Darby and his colleagues were raised up to have the brethren church practice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their expounding of the Word of God opened up the Bible and brought much light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>William Law's improvement of mysticism helped Andrew Murray to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From that point onward was the line of the inner life, which included Mrs. Penn-Lewis and all the great speakers in the Keswick Convention such as G. Campbell Morgan, A. J. Gordon, and S. D. Gordon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With T. Austin-Sparks the writings on the inner life reached their highest level.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the early 1900s Pentecostalism came out, and since the last century great preachers became prevailing such as C. H. Spurgeon, D. L. Moody, and Charles Finney.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today there are others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are major items of the Lord's move from the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All this has become history.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Reformation, however, eventually became a dead thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Mysticism died out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Moravian church life begun with Zinzendorf is far from what it once was.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The inner life line died out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today it is hard to even hear the term "inner life."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What has been the result of the great evangelistic campaigns?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They put out reports that thousands were gained by the Lord, but now where are they?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is hardly any increase in the statistics of the entire Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Assemblies of God have the highest rate of increase among the denominations, but it is only six percent yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a dying situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we must consider what way we should take.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Should we take the Reformation way, the mystic way, the Moravian way, the Wesleyan way, the Brethren way, the inner life way, the Pentecostal way, or the giant preacher way?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have been under the influence of Christianity for years, and this influence is still surrounding us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is hard for us to jump out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1927 I jumped out of Christianity, but I still had a Christianity "tail."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That "tail" was with me, but it was reducing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It took thirty years to get this "tail" to completely disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must take the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The new way is first to cut off the "tail."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not wait to reduce it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not say that since it took me thirty years to reduce the tail, you need more time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You can be faster.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jump into the new way to go out and visit people by door knocking and setting up meetings in homes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then your "tail" will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the leavened items in Christianity are a part of the "tail."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Much of the truth taught today is full of leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The birth of Christ has been leavened to a mass, Christmas, and the resurrection of Christ has been leavened to Easter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The way we have practiced in our meetings is still a part of the "tail."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the old way to gather a congregation and to have a preacher, to encourage the congregation to come together every Sunday morning to hear a speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may think that there is nothing wrong for a gifted speaker to speak to you on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the entire practice of such a meeting is a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible tells us that we are all members of the living Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:27 , and the Bible charges us as the members of Christ to function Rom 12:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first item of functioning is to preach the gospel, to reach the sinners, to visit them to bring them to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Have we done this?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every Lord's Day we have had a big meeting occupying us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Actually this kind of meeting has killed our function.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many of us have been sitting in big meetings for years, but how much fruit did we bear?</S>
