CONCERNING PROPER DISCUSSION</h2>
<p>We must learn not to hide anything or do anything independently but to open everything for discussion. However, we also must learn to discuss without losing our temper. This is not easy. In the early years of my service in the church, I learned much concerning this point. For the first few years that I served, I did not say much in the way of discussion because I did not have the assurance that I could control my temper. I knew that I should participate in the discussions, but I also realized that I was not qualified, because my temper was not dealt with. I repented to the Lord for not being purified from my temper so that I could be used by Him. I also confessed to the brothers the reason for my silence. Eventually, I learned to discuss without losing my temper.</p>
<p>We should not insist when we are in a discussion with the brothers. To insist is a sign that we are ruled by our temper. Acts 15 records that there was much discussion, but we also know that there was no insisting, because verse 25 says that they became of one accord. To avoid insisting is not easy. As long as we are natural, have a temper, and are in our self, we will insist on our opinion. To discuss in a proper way is quite difficult; it requires many lessons of the cross. If we do not learn these lessons, our discussions will become battles. Nevertheless, we need to have much discussion. We should not excuse our silence by saying that we want to keep the oneness when actually we dare not speak because we are weak in the spirit and not yet free from our temper.</p>
<p>The apostles and elders in Acts 15 had all learned much through many spiritual experiences. Therefore, they were qualified to participate in the discussion, and they did so without losing their temper. Because they discussed without insisting, they were able to accept the final decision even if the decision went against their initial opinion. It is not easy to not be offended when what we say in a discussion is set aside. Nevertheless, we must learn to discuss without losing our temper, insisting, or being offended. In the affairs of government, people often play politics in order to avoid offending others or to save face. However, in Acts 15 there was no offending, no saving of face, and no playing of politics. The brothers were open and genuine.</p>
<p>It is quite difficult to put the normal and proper principles in Acts 15 into practice. In order to perform an operation, a surgeon must be qualified, and he and his instruments must be sterilized, purified; otherwise, he will introduce germs into his patient and make the patient sicker. Similarly, in order to participate in the fellowship of the co-workers and elders, we must be qualified and purified. When we try to put the principles in Acts 15 into practice, we will find that we are not qualified or prepared if we have not learned the lessons of the cross and have not been purified or thoroughly dealt with. Our participation in a discussion will become a problem. If we are offended in a discussion, this indicates that we are in the flesh. If we are not in the flesh, we will not care to save our face or be concerned about whether others respect us. To be overly concerned about politeness is actually to play politics for the sake of the flesh, but the flesh has no place in the meetings of the co-workers and elders. The example of Acts 15 can be practiced only by those who have learned the lessons of the cross. Because the early apostles and elders had adequately learned the lessons of the cross, they were qualified to have such a discussion. They participated in the discussion because they felt that they had something to say, but they did so without insisting or losing their temper. As a result, their discussion ended not in offense but in one accord (v. 25). Therefore, especially among the co-workers and elders there is the need to learn many lessons of the cross.</p>
