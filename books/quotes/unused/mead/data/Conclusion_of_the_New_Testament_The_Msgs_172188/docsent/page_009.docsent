   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, when we say that we are in Christ, this means that we are saved, are enjoying God's blessing, have peace with God, and are under God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when we say that we are joint partakers in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus, this means that we are suffering and are being persecuted as we follow Jesus the Nazarene.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Being in the kingdom today is a matter of being in the suffering of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation 1:9 also speaks of being a joint partaker in the endurance in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For both the tribulation and the kingdom we need endurance.</S>
