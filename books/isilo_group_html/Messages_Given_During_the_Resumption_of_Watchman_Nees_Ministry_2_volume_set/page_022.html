Knowing the Teaching of the Anointing</H2><P>Brother Lee answered: First John 2:27 mentions the anointing: "The anointing which you have received from Him...." In Greek, the word anointing is a gerund; it is not a simple noun. The anointing as a gerund denotes a moving and an application of an ointment. Within us we have the teaching of the anointing, and we do not need any teaching from man. This anointing is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught us, we should abide in Him. God abides in us, and we abide in Him. Although these appear to be two different things, yet in fact they are not two things, but one thing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Lord's Abiding in Us Being Based<br>on Our Abiding in Him</H2><P>In the New Testament, there is a difference between the two phrases "in the Lord" and "abiding in the Lord." To be in the Lord refers to being saved, whereas to abide in the Lord refers to living an overcoming life, one that is in fellowship with the Lord. To abide in the Lord is to have fellowship with Him. The Lord's abiding in us is based upon our abiding in Him, while our abiding in Him is based upon our being in Him. When electricity is installed to a lamp, it can be considered as being "in" the lamp. But when the switch is turned on and electricity is applied, then the electricity is "abiding" in the lamp. Some people abide in sin, the flesh, and the world. Although such a one may be a person in Christ, he does not abide in Him at all. You may be a person who belongs to Christ, yet you never abide in Him. Some have asked if a person who is abiding in Christ can move out again. Actually, in our experience, we can move in and out more than a dozen times within a day. The fact of our being in Christ is once for all and can never change. But our abiding in the Lord and the Lord's abiding in us is something relative. In the entire New Testament, you cannot find one incident where it says that He will abide in us without us abiding in Him first; these two things are linked together. Romans 8 mentions the Holy Spirit abiding in us. Every saved person has the Holy Spirit in him, but this does not mean that every one has the Holy Spirit abiding in him. The Holy Spirit does not have the complete authority over every one yet. God's abiding in us is based on our abiding in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Abiding in the Lord according to<br>the Teaching of the Anointing</H2><P>How do we abide in God? We abide in Him according to the teaching of the anointing. The Holy Spirit operates in us. This operation is the application of the ointment. Suppose you want to joke with Brother Shen, but there is an inner restriction that tells you not to do it. If you disobey it and keep on joking, you will lose the peace. You will be cut off from the Lord and will not be able to continue in the fellowship. This disruption in fellowship can last for a whole day. Only after you confess your sin will this fellowship with God be resumed. Consider again the example of the sisters scolding their children or their servants. A sister does not need someone outside of her to tell her that this is wrong. Instead, the operation inside of her will restrict her. The greatest punishment to a Christian is not outward sufferings, but being cut off from his fellowship with the Lord.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
