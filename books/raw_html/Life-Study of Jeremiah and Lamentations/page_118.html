In this message we will begin to consider the various aspects of this promised restoration revealed in chapters thirty and thirty-one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JEHOVAH APPEARING TO ISRAEL FROM AFAR</H2><P>Jehovah appeared to Israel from afar (from the wilderness where they followed Him&#151;2:2b). Jehovah said that He loved Israel with an eternal love (the bridal love&#151;2:2a); therefore, He has drawn them with lovingkindness (31:3). Jehovah went on to say, "I will build you again, and you will be built, / O virgin of Israel. / Again you will adorn yourself with your tambourines / And will go forth in the dance of those who make merry. / Again you will plant vineyards / On the mountains of Samaria; / The planters will plant / And will partake of the fruit" (vv. 4-5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. JEHOVAH TURNING THE CAPTIVITY<br>OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH</H2><P>Jehovah will turn the captivity of Israel and Judah and will bring them back to the land which He gave to their fathers, and they will possess it (30:3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Telling Jacob Not to Fear<br>and Israel Not to Be Dismayed</H2><P>In verse 10a Jehovah declared that Jacob, His servant, should not fear and that Israel should not be dismayed. He would save them from afar, and their seed from the land of their captivity. Then He promised, "Jacob will return and will be quiet and at ease, / And none will frighten him. / For I am with you, declares Jehovah, to save you; / For I will make a full end of all the nations to which I have scattered you; / But I will not make a full end of you" (vv. 10b-11a).</P>
