   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE NINETY-SIX THE COVERING OF THE TABERNACLE 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 26:7-14; 36:14-19; 40:19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we considered the first layer of the covering of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we pointed out, that layer is itself called the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Exodus 26:1 speaks of making the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine linen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall consider the second, third, and fourth layers of the covering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 7 and 8 say, And you shall make curtains of goats hair for a tent over the tabernacle: you shall make eleven curtains.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits one measure for the eleven curtains.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the last message we pointed out that the tabernacle is a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we see from verse 7 that the second layer of the cover is a tent over the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the second layer is a tent which covers the first layer, which is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The tabernacle was made of ten curtains, each measuring twenty-eight cubits by four cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second layer is made of eleven curtains, each measuring thirty cubits by four cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first layer is called the tabernacle, and the second layer is called the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is significant that there are ten curtains in the first layer and eleven in the second layer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible ten is the number of human completion and perfection, and twelve is the number of perfection in the divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, ten is composed of two times five.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, the ten virgins in Matthew 25 are in two groups of five, and the Ten Commandments were inscribed in groups of five on two tablets of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we have seen, the number five is composed of four, signifying the creature, plus one, signifying God the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The number eleven falls between ten and twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is more than human completion and less than the perfection of the divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the number eleven in the Bible indicates something sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, it points to something in excess of human completion; on the other hand, it indicates something short of the perfection in the divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, this number indicates sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ten curtains which make up the first layer of the tabernacle indicate that the Lord Jesus as a human being was complete and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the true number ten, for with Him there is no defect, bias, shortage, or excess.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He also has the colors of blue, purple, and scarlet which, respectively, signify heavenliness, royalty, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, the golden cherubim embroidered on the linen curtains signify that in Christ as a creature God s glory is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the ten linen curtains of the first layer reveal that Christ is a perfect, complete, and altogether beautiful human being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second layer of covering typifies a very different aspect of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this layer we have nothing blue, purple, or scarlet, and there is no embroidery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, there are eleven curtains of goats hair.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything is plain, natural, and without beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, the number of the curtains is eleven instead of ten, something more than human completion, but below the perfection of God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The eleven curtains of goats hair signify that Christ was made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the last three hours He was on the cross, from noon until three o clock in the afternoon, He was judged just as if He were a sinner in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was the time He cried out and said, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In these hours He was forsaken by God because God regarded Him as a sinner, as the One who was made sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The perfect and complete Lord Jesus thus became a sinner under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He, the righteous One, was judged by God on behalf of the unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Bible fine linen signifies the proper conduct of a pure and perfect human being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, goats signify those who are evil and condemned by God Matt 25:33, 41 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, goats signify sinners, and goats hair signifies the sins, the evil deeds, of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, the second layer is composed of sinners with all their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Having considered the number of curtains in the first two layers, let us now turn to their measurements.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Each curtain in the first layer was four cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ten curtains times four cubits gives us the number forty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Bible forty can be a positive number.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps the most impressive use of this number concerns Moses staying with God on the mountain for forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have seen that the number forty signifies tests and trials.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The forty days Moses was on the mountain were a test both to him and to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although Moses was approved by God during this period of time, the children of Israel were exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In addition, they were tested during their forty years of wandering in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus also spent forty days in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This signifies that He was One who was tried, tested, and eventually approved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the four Gospels, the Lord was tested and tried throughout His life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the very end of His life, He was tried both according to God s law and to the law of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Three times He was tried by Jewish authorities according to God s law, and three times He was tried by officials of the Roman Empire according to the Roman law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, during the last night of His life, He was tried a total of six times, but no wrong could be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was fully approved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, He was a perfect number forty.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As far as the Lord Jesus is concerned, this number is very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the ten curtains of the first layer are joined, they form a rectangle measuring forty cubits by twenty-eight cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Of these forty cubits, twenty covered the Holy Place, ten covered the Holy of Holies, and ten hung down over the rear of the tabernacle, covering the back side.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, as we pointed out in the foregoing message, there was an overhang on two sides of the tabernacle of nine cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nine, composed of three times three, signifies the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ, the perfect One, has an overflow on each side, and this overflow is the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As we consider the Lord Jesus revealed in the Gospels, we see that He is truly such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is a perfect human being with an overflow of the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Each of the curtains in the second layer measured thirty cubits by four cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When all the curtains were joined, there was a rectangle measuring forty-four cubits by thirty cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This second layer completely covered the first layer and protected it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Fine linen cannot protect anything, but goats hair can serve as a protection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>According to verse 9, the sixth curtain was doubled over at the front of the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This was for protection and strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The overhang at the rear completely covered the first layer.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Furthermore, with the second layer of covering there was an overhang of ten cubits on the two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Since the first layer had an overhang of only nine cubits, it was completely covered by the second layer.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This means that no part of the linen curtains was exposed to the sun, wind, or rain.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The number thirty in the Bible is composed in two ways, of five times six and three times ten.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Five is the number of responsibility, and six is the number of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Thus, thirty composed of five times six signifies responsibility for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When the Lord Jesus was made sin for us, He bore all the responsibility for us as sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But when the number thirty is composed of three times ten, it signifies resurrection life in human completion.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As the One who became sin for us, the Lord Jesus is full of resurrection life in His human completion.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In His human completion, signified by the number ten, we see resurrection, which is actually the Triune God Himself, signified by the number three.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>With the Lord Jesus as the One made sin for us, we have the numbers thirty and forty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Forty-four was the length of the second layer when all the curtains were joined.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This number signifies that Christ was tried as a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We need to be impressed with what is portrayed by these first two layers of covering.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The first layer signifies that in Himself the Lord Jesus is glorious and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The second layer signifies that this wonderful One was made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In His being, Christ is wonderful, but as our substitute, He became sin in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We have pointed out that the second layer protects the first layer.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>By this we see that Christ protects us by being our substitute, by being judged for us, and by dying for us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Christ s substitution, therefore, becomes our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The numbers in each layer are significant.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God is the best designer, and the numbers were all determined by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Thus, it is meaningful that the dimensions of the first layer of ten curtains are forty by twenty-eight, whereas the dimensions of the second layer of eleven curtains are forty-four by thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is no accident that the first layer was made of fine linen and the second layer, of goats hair.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In brief, these two layers signify that the perfect man, the Lord Jesus, was made sin in the eyes of God for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Now, as our substitute, He is our covering and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>As we shall see in the next message, under these two layers of covering were the standing boards, which typify us as believers.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We are the boards standing under the covering and protection of Jesus Christ, the perfect man, who was made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we did not have this type, we would not be able to know the Lord Jesus in such a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We could not see so clearly how He is a perfect man, and that He became our substitute to die on the cross for our sins and to be judged by God for us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The many details of these two layers of covering the fine linen, the goats hair, and all the numbers are related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>For example, we have seen that six is the number of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It points to something in excess.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Surely hatred and theft are things which are in excess.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Thus, the number six is the number of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>According to the New Testament, the antichrist, the man of sin, will be the number six hundred sixty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This reveals that he will be completely constituted of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The Lord Jesus, by contrast, is eight hundred eighty-eight, for He is a Person constituted of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>He was resurrected on the eighth day, the first day of a new week.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If we do not accept this understanding of the details of the coverings, how should we understand them?</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The proper way to interpret them is as types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Many Christians follow the teaching which says that we should not regard anything in the Old Testament as a type unless it is explicitly referred to as a type in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>According to this view, we should only accept as types those things which the New Testament clearly says are types.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>For example, because John 1:29 speaks of Christ as the Lamb of God, we may then regard the lamb in Exodus 12 as a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>However, when Paul was interpreting the typology of the tabernacle in Hebrews 9, he told us that he had a great deal more to say, but did not have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This indicates that those matters which Paul does not refer to as types may also be types.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Thus, many persons and things in the Old Testament may also be genuine types, even though they are not denoted as such in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Take Joseph as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>A great many Christians recognize that Joseph is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>However, the New Testament does not say that Joseph is a type of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Many Christians neglect important Old Testament types by holding to the view that only what the New Testament indicates is a type should be regarded as a type.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Many readers of the Bible think of the tabernacle as a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>However, where does the New Testament say directly that the tabernacle typifies the church?</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Although this is not stated directly, implications of this can be found.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If we infer from these implications that the tabernacle typifies the church, how shall we understand the first two layers of the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>What place do they have in our inference?</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>To be sure, it is necessary to make proper inferences concerning these two layers and interpret them as types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The Old Testament is a picture book, and the New Testament is a book of interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>In principle, what is revealed in the New Testament corresponds to what is contained in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>It is not always necessary for the New Testament to say definitely that a certain thing in the Old Testament is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>It is adequate and proper to find in the New Testament the meaning of all the aspects of the Old Testament types.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>All these matters pertaining to the tabernacle should be understood according to the New Testament principle.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>We understand the Old Testament in a New Testament way and thereby see a detailed picture of both Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>I can testify that after I came to know more details of the Lord from studying the types in the Old Testament, I began to love the Lord more.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>In addition, this understanding of the Bible strengthens my faith that the Bible is truly inspired by God.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>It is impossible for anyone other than God to design such a structure as the tabernacle and to give us such a record concerning it.</S>
