<P>We have received God's grace, but God established His covenant with us according to His righteousness, so that we can reckon with God and lay hold of His Word. The way of faith is to speak to God and reckon with Him by taking hold of His Word. We are indeed standing on the ground of grace. But we do not receive grace directly; grace does not come to us directly. The blood of Jesus Christ has become the foundation of righteousness; the covenant God made with us can no longer fail. We can now communicate with God on the foundation of righteousness. God loves to see us taking hold of His Word as a handle. He has given us promises based on His facts. One person who was experienced in the Lord said, "God's covenant is God's therapy for unbelief; He uses the covenant to heal the unbelieving ones." In seeking for the forgiveness of sins, before some people consider themselves as being forgiven, they pray until they feel peaceful in their hearts. But what does the Bible tell us? It tells us that we are forgiven by believing in the Word of God. First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." God says that when there is confession, there is forgiveness. Therefore, if we confess our sins, our sins will surely be forgiven. If we believe, we will receive the peace of forgiveness. God says that our duty is to confess and His duty is to forgive. If we do our part, God will do His part. We only have to take care of our part; we do not have to take care of God's part. Mr. Wilkes put it well when he asked, "Will God not do His part when you have done your part?" Therefore, we do not have to worry about our feelings, and we do not have to care about what others say. We do not have to worry about what Satan will inject into our thoughts. All we have to do is to take care of God's Word. As long as we confess, He will forgive. The life of a Christian is nothing other than a life of holding onto God's Word. We believe that God is faithful and righteous, and that whatever He has said will be done. He has said it, and it is so. If we stand fully on the covenant enacted by the Lord's blood, God will care for us and give us everything. God cannot hold back anything from us because He has accepted the blood of the Lord Jesus. God has bound His will in His covenant; He can only operate within the confines of His covenant. Before He made the covenant, He could deal with us as He wished. But after He made the covenant with us, He has only been able to act according to the words in the covenant. God cannot be unrighteous; He has to deal with us in righteousness. He loves us and is merciful to us. He cannot deal with us except in righteousness. No other grace is greater than this! Therefore, where grace is manifested the most, righteousness is also manifested the most.</P><P>The blood of the Lord Jesus is the price of the purchase. The new covenant is the document that proves the purchase, while our faith appropriates what the Lord's blood has purchased. God is pleased to see us labor and build on this field. Suppose you have spent one thousand dollars to buy a piece of land. The money is paid and the grant deed has been transferred to you. You can rule over this land, farm on the land, and build on it. You can rule over this land because you have paid a price for it, not because anyone has granted you a favor. Whatever you have received is what you deserve to receive because you have paid the former owner the price of one thousand dollars. Without the blood of the Lord Jesus, I can honestly say that we do not deserve anything. But because of the blood of the Lord Jesus, we deserve everything. As soon as we receive the blood of the Lord Jesus, we have the right to execute everything contained in God's covenant. What is given to us through the Lord's blood is God's grace. When we ask for God's blessing, based on His covenant and the Lord's blood, and when He blesses us according to His covenant, we are just acting according to righteousness.</P><P>Why does a grant deed need to go through a procedure of being stamped by the government? What is the use of the piece of paper? The little piece of paper comforts our heart. The paper grants us the protection of the government and the protection of the law. God is afraid that our faith is too small to believe in God, and His grace is too bountiful to remember. Therefore, He gave us the new covenant. God is not afraid that He will be unfaithful. This is why He is not afraid to put even the most stringent terms in the covenant. When we claim something according to this covenant, He will surely give it to us.</P><P>In this meeting, we want to know one thing: why is this the age of the new covenant or the New Testament? Today is the age of the new covenant because God has been waiting for His church to rise up and bargain with Him according to His covenant for two thousand years. He has been expecting His church to communicate with Him according to His covenant and demand that He fulfill everything. Brothers and sisters, our faith will be encouraged by speaking to God. He expects to see us speaking to Him in faith. We can lay hold of God's covenant and tell Him, "God, You have to give this to us, and You have to give it to us according to Your righteousness and faithfulness because You have said it in Your covenant." Then we will see fresh grace pouring down from heaven, and we will praise Him because He will fill our mouth with honey. When this happens, we will not need to force a few words of praise out of our mouth during the worship meetings; our mouth will always be filled with "Hallelujahs."</P><P>James said that we do not have because we do not ask, and even if we ask, we do not receive because we would waste what we have (James 4:2-3). But I have to add one more word: we do not receive even when we ask because we do not believe. We do not believe in God's promise, fact, and Word. Soon we will consider the principle of prayer. The principle of prayer is to speak to God by taking hold of the handle in His Word. In the Old Testament, the Lord said in one place that we should ask and command Him (Isa. 45:11). Oh, we can command God!</P><P>You may not know how precious the blood is. If you want to evaluate the value of the blood, do not evaluate according to your understanding. Just say to God, "I do not know the value of the blood, but I ask that You fulfill my requests according to how You value the blood." If you do not pray this way, your prayer and life will be ineffectual. If you lift up the blood before God, you can claim what the covenant has established by the blood. Mr. Andrew Murray said that no one can know all that the blood includes. You cannot fully understand the value of the blood, and you do not have to fully understand. You do not have to see the full value of the blood with your eyes. All you have to do is to say to God, "God, fulfill my prayer according to how You value the blood." You do not have to beg painfully. You can simply pray. Sometimes, you do not even have to pray; you only need to tell God that you want this because it is in His covenant. God will never be unfaithful.</P><P>Therefore, we can see why an unbelieving person will suffer great punishment. Hebrews 10:29 says, "By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?" This kind of person is unsaved; he has despised the blood through which Jesus Christ enacted the covenant. There is no hope for him. He does not believe in the death and redemption of the Lord Jesus and nothing more can be done for him. Apart from the Lord Jesus, he can never find another Savior to redeem him and his end is punishment. However, if we lay hold of God's word, our future will be bright and glorious. The Lord's blood has satisfied God's heart and His demands. God is now standing on our side. All we have to do is believe in His Word. Revelation does not come after faith. First, there is the revelation; then there is the faith to believe in what God has given us.</P>
