These chapters are a continuation of Jehovah's promise concerning the restoration of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. ZEDEKIAH, THE KING OF JUDAH,<br>IMPRISONING JEREMIAH AND<br>CONDEMNING HIS PROPHECY</H2><P>In 32:1-5 Zedekiah, the king of Judah, imprisoned Jeremiah and condemned his prophecy concerning the capturing of the city of Jerusalem and Zedekiah. Later, Zedekiah was caught while trying to escape. Nebuchadnezzar killed Zedekiah's sons in his presence and then put out his eyes and took him to Babylon, where he died. With Zedekiah, a pitiful king, the kingship of the royal family was terminated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. JEREMIAH BUYING THE FIELD<br>OF HIS COUSIN HANAMEL IN ANATHOTH<br>ACCORDING TO JEHOVAH'S WORD</H2><P>In verses 6 through 15 Jeremiah bought the field of his cousin Hanamel in Anathoth according to Jehovah's word, signifying that houses, fields, and vineyards would again be bought in the holy land. This indicates that although Jerusalem and Zedekiah would be captured, God would still keep the holy land with His people. In God's intention the holy land would remain a fit place for His people to live.</P>
