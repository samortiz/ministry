   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LESSER LEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Under the greater ledge is the lesser ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This ledge also has two edges of one cubit each, making it a total of sixteen cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The number sixteen is composed of eight times two, signifying a witness two in resurrection eight .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is a living witness in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE BASE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The base also has two edges of one cubit each, making it a total of eighteen cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The number eighteen is composed of six times three or three times six, signifying man, the Triune God, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of its unique design, the altar is very solid and stable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is wider at the base than it is at the top.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The base is eighteen cubits square, the lesser ledge is sixteen cubits square, the greater ledge is fourteen cubits square, and the altar is twelve cubits square.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This type of construction makes the altar very stable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the top were wider than the bottom, the altar would not be stable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But because the bottom is much wider than the top, the altar can stand solidly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nothing can shake it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On every story, on every section, there are edges, which spread out like two arms to hold something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The borders of the edges also rise up to hold something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This clear picture shows us that the altar is not only solid and stable but is also able to hold things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that the death of Christ on the cross is not only stable and solid but also able to hold things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His wonderful, marvelous, all-inclusive death is able to hold all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE HORNS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At each of the four corners of the hearth of God, a horn points upward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Bible horns signify strength and power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The horns on the altar, which are toward the four corners of the earth and which are also upward, signify the power of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The power of the church and of the saints depends on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we experience the cross, the more spiritual power we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE STEPS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The steps up to the altar are toward the east.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The east indicates the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the direction of the rising of the sun, which signifies the glory of the Lord Num 2:3; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>43:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that the cross always points to God s glory and always leads to God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE CUBIT MEASUREMENT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The cubit used by Ezekiel is not the common human cubit; rather, it is a cubit plus a handbreadth 43:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is called a great cubit and is not a human measurement but a divine measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, the altar is not measured by the human cubit but by the divine cubit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should never measure ourselves by our human measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our measurement may be of value to us, but it is of no value to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may feel that, according to our human measurement and standard, we are qualified, but according to the divine measurement, we fall short.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE ALTAR AND THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The last point concerning the altar is the relationship of the altar with the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only after passing through the altar can we come to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that without the proper realization and experience of the cross of Christ, we cannot have the reality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The temple signifies Christ, and it also signifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can have the genuine church life only after we have had the experience of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we desire to have the proper church life, we need an adequate realization and experience of the altar, of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is only after we realize that we have been thoroughly terminated on the cross that we can have the real church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be in the outer court having the enjoyment of Christ is wonderful, but it is far from the experience of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be in the inner court where the ministry begins is also wonderful, but even this is far from the experience of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be in the temple is to be in something that is altogether in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we need to go on until we pass through the altar, through the cross of Christ, and come to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There we will have the reality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to be impressed with the fact that only by passing through the altar can we come to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whereas the altar signifies the cross, the temple signifies both Christ and the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The cross, Christ, and the church are the central subject not only of the New Testament but also of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First we come to the altar, the cross, and then we come to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This indicates that we cannot have the church apart from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through the experience of the cross, we are brought into the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only as we pass through the cross do we have the real church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the one hand, as saved ones we come together to practice the church life; on the other hand, we can have the reality of the church only after we have passed through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all need to be brought to the point where we know and accept the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then as we pass through the cross, our flesh, our old creation, our self, and our natural man with the natural life will all be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everything that has its source in our humanity will be terminated at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then we will have the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we will be one in the Lord, we will have genuine coordination, and we will have harmony, rest, and the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the temple, the place where God dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the expression of Christ, the reality of the church.</S>
