<h2 class="head1">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>Approximately four hundred and twenty-five brothers came together in Anaheim, California for an elders&rsquo; training with Brother Witness Lee in February of 1986. Book 7 entitled <em>One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move</em> and Book 8 entitled <em>The Life-Pulse of the Lord&rsquo;s Present Move</em> contain Brother Lee&rsquo;s fellowship during those days. As the Lord is bringing all the local churches into His up-to-date move, the fellowship contained in these two books of this set of the elders&rsquo; training series is vital. For the carrying out of the present practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, it is crucial that every saint enter into the burden of the word that was spoken in this training.</p>
<p>We trust that the vision of all the points presented in these two volumes would be wrought into us and that we would live according to this revelation. Our prayer is that all the churches with all the saints would be brought into one accord for the Lord&rsquo;s move and that the life-pulse of the Lord&rsquo;s present move, which comprises the home gatherings, the truth lessons, the burden for full-timers, with all being either a job-dropping one or a money-making one, and the spreading of the gospel, would become a living reality in all the churches.</p>

<h2 class="head1">A TRAINING OF PRACTICES</h2>
<p>Our fellowship in this elders&rsquo; training of 1986 will not be that much in vision, teaching, or doctrine. My burden to have this training is absolutely for the practice. Since October of 1984, the Lord has begun something new in Taiwan. Some brothers from the United States went to Taiwan and they got burned with the fire of the Lord&rsquo;s new move. They came back to the United States with this fire. Because I dared not control, restrict, or quench this fire which has begun in the United States, I had a burden to pass on some practical points of fellowship according to the urgent need. Again, this is a training of practices, not doctrine.</p>
<p>The troubles that Christianity has been suffering always come from two sources&mdash;doctrines and practices. Most of the debates are concerning the doctrines. Doctrines, of course, bring in practices, and practices follow doctrines. The New Testament gives us the vision, the revelation, concerning the church. Following the revelation are the practices. It is not true to say that some of the practices in the New Testament are not according to the revelation concerning the church. Actually, every practice in the New Testament is according to the divine revelation, the heavenly vision, of the church. Throughout our history in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, all of our practices have been according to what we have seen of the Lord&rsquo;s revelation, of the heavenly vision.</p>
<p>We need such a training concerning how to take care of the practical side of the recovery. Just to talk about the recovery is not sufficient. Just to say that you are in the recovery, for the recovery, and one with the recovery does not mean too much. This is like a &ldquo;kite in the air&rdquo; and is not something solid on the rock which could never be shaken. We have been in the recovery for over half a century. We have never been shaken and nothing has ever changed us because we have seen not only the doctrines, the visions, the revelation concerning the church, but also the practices.</p>
<p>Since October of 1984 in Taiwan we have seen and discovered something more. The practices among us have been radically changed. Even up to the present time, however, many who are very positive for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are not clear about what I am doing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM OF AMBITION<br />
AMONG THE ELDERS AND CO-WORKERS</h2>
<p>In the book of Revelation there are no elders in the churches; rather, there are the messengers who are the stars (Rev. 1:16, 20). At the time this book was written, the church had become degraded. Hence, in Revelation, the Lord repudiates all formalities. Being an elder may be somewhat legal or formal. Do not desire to be an elder; desire to be a shining star. Do not be one with a mere position&mdash;be a shining star.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been with us for over sixty years. It was under the leadership of Brother Watchman Nee on mainland China for the first thirty years, from 1922 to 1952. The eldership greatly bothered us. I was not taking the lead in the recovery at that time, but I was always under Brother Nee&rsquo;s umbrella. He talked to me personally about the problem of the eldership. Since I came out of mainland China to Taiwan and then to the United States, over the past thirty-seven years the matter of the eldership has caused me much concern and has burdened me to such an extent that I did not know how to deal with the situation. What is the main trouble? Ambition. When we were having the training on Matthew in 1976 I illustrated that a wife of an elder is not like the first lady, the wife of the president. All the wives of the elders should consider themselves as wives of slaves. Because of the poor situation, nearly everyone has ambition in the matter of the eldership. This bothers me.</p>
<p>In 1973 this ambition crept into the recovery. Since 1973 ambition was brought in and has been very much promoted and uplifted either secretly or openly. Ambition has been growing up to be a real &ldquo;gopher&rdquo; in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. According to my observation, from 1973 until the present day we have missed the mark to some extent and have suffered much loss in the rate of increase. The rate of increase in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been very much brought down by the ambition of the elders and by the ambition of the co-workers. This ambition has damaged us very much. Throughout the past thirteen years I have been fighting against this very thing&mdash;the ambition of the elders and the ambition of the co-workers. I really hate this ambition among us. I have had some consideration that it might be better not to have a mere official eldership. We should pay attention to the way revealed in Revelation where there are only messengers or stars and no elders.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>The practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery beginning from October of 1984 and starting in Taiwan was something absolutely new. I do not like to see the dear saints from the United States going to Taiwan to see something and then coming back to the United States to merely imitate or copy it. This will not work and may even damage the situation because you probably are not so clear about the Lord&rsquo;s doing. Presently, I am somewhat unhappy about the practice of the home gatherings in the United States and Canada. This practice is a mere imitation and not something carried out by seeing the vision. If you have seen a vision and act according to it, this kind of practice is valuable and worthwhile. To merely copy someone else&rsquo;s doing means nothing. I would not say you should not practice the home gatherings, but I do not believe that to merely copy or imitate would help you. Instead, you will make yourself a lifeless robot. If you mean business with the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and if you mean business with His present day, up-to-date move, you must first take care of this one thing&mdash;one accord.</p>
<p>The four Gospels tell us how the Lord spent three and a half years to teach His disciples. Much of this teaching is recorded in the Gospels, yet the Lord said in John that He had many things to say to the disciples that they could not bear, but that He would die and resurrect and come back in another form as the Spirit of reality. As the Spirit of reality, He would not only remind the disciples of what He had spoken to them, but also go on to tell them something further (John 14:16-20, 25-26; 16:12-15). In the three and a half years of His earthly ministry the Lord passed on many teachings to the disciples. Then He went away through His death and came back within three days to stay with them as the life-giving Spirit. After breathing Himself into His disciples, He stayed with them for forty days to train them to experience His invisible presence. He then ascended to the heavens, leaving the disciples on this earth. What did the one hundred twenty do? They did nothing except to pray, and the key of their prayer was the one accord (Acts 1:14).</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:19 the Lord spoke concerning two or three agreeing on something in prayer. The word &ldquo;agree&rdquo; in this verse is not as strong as the word &ldquo;one accord.&rdquo; The word in Greek for one accord, <em>homothumadon,</em> is strong and all-inclusive. <em>Homo</em> means the same and <em>thumos</em> means mind, will, purpose (soul, heart). The Chinese version of the Bible translates this word into a Chinese word meaning the same mind and the same will. In Romans 15:6, the King James Version translates this word into &ldquo;one mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the book of Acts the one hundred twenty prayed together in one mind, in the same mind, in the same will with the same purpose around and within the soul and the heart. Whenever we pray, we surely should exercise our spirit, but we also should be in the same mind and the same will with the same purpose around and within our soul and heart. This means that our entire being is involved. After the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, the one hundred twenty became the kind of persons who were in one mind, in one will, with one purpose around their soul and heart. For them to be in one accord meant that their entire beings were one. No other book of the Bible uses the word for &ldquo;one accord&rdquo; as much as Acts.</p>
<p>In Acts the three main factors for the spreading of the gospel as an impact were prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. According to the Bible and according to history these three items are the only way for the gospel to be prevailing. I spent much time to consider whether it is not beyond the teaching of the Scriptures for the church to use a church meeting hall and church personnel to open a school rather than to use our time to contact people one on one with prayer, the Spirit, and the Word, using every inch of the meeting hall in this way for the gospel. I stressed in the past that to use other ways besides prayer, the Word, and the Spirit to promote the gospel are gimmicks.</p>
<p>The one accord is the key and the life pulse of prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. You may pray much, seek the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and acquire a lot of knowledge from the Word, yet if you are short of the one accord you cannot see the blessing. I saw people who were desperate in praying, in getting the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and in receiving the Word, yet they were dissenting among themselves. There was no one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MORALE AND THE IMPACT</h2>
<p>From January 1, 1940 to December 31, 1942 I stayed in Chefoo, my hometown in mainland China. During that time, the Lord brought all the saints there into the one accord and there was a real revival with the real impact. In Shanghai, in Taiwan, and in Elden Hall in Los Angeles, I also saw the effectiveness of the one accord.</p>
<p>In the army the impact is the morale. What is the morale in the army? The one accord. This is why no commander of any army would allow any soldier to bring in any different thought. The soldiers all think the same thing, speak the same thing, stand for the same thing, and live for the same thing. If anyone expresses anything different and is dissenting, he will be cut off in order to keep the morale. This kind of morale cannot be seen among today&rsquo;s Christians. I can testify, though, that in Chefoo from 1940 through 1942 the morale, the impact, was there. Even the outsiders in Chefoo realized this. Some told people not to go to our meeting hall because if they were to go, they would get caught. People were also told that if they wanted to be a Christian, the best place for them to go was our meeting hall. During those years we also performed the casting out of demons; even the demons told people not to go to our meeting hall. The impact was really there.</p>
<p>Recently in Taiwan over one hundred thirty full-timers under our training were sent out. I told them something which I never told people since I came out of mainland China&mdash;to cast out demons and heal the sick. We do not promote these things, but when the morale is in us, these things will be among us as an impact. In the Acts are three items&mdash;prayer, the Spirit, and the Word, with one key&mdash;the one accord. After Acts 15, however, this word for one accord is not used again in the book of Acts. This somewhat implies that even during this period of time described in Acts, the one accord was lost. Acts 15 describes a conference of the apostles and elders held in Jerusalem to settle the trouble concerning circumcision (vv. 1-33). At the end of Acts 15 there was a dissenting between Barnabas and Paul. After this incident, I believe that the one accord to some extent was lost.</p>
<p>The first Epistle in the New Testament is Romans. After Paul talked so much doctrinally concerning the Christian life and church life, he told the believers in Rome that they needed to be &ldquo;with one accord and with one mouth...&rdquo; (15:6). One accord includes one mind, one will, and one purpose in one soul and in one heart. Then outwardly you have one mouth. Those of us who were in Los Angeles from 1963 to 1973 can recall that we were with one accord and with one mouth. Whoever came to a meeting in those years could sense and realize the impact. Because there was no dissenting or different opinion, there was the impact. Beginning in 1973, however, ambition came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery as a poison injected into the Body, and up until today the blood has never been purified.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR EXPERIENCE IN MAINLAND CHINA</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery in mainland China started in 1922. I was with Brother Nee until I left for Taiwan in 1949. Throughout those twenty-seven years Brother Nee was always under a suffering due to the fact that there were saints, co-workers, and elders receiving his ministry, yet it was hard to see that they were one. There were different opinions among the ones who received his ministry&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, this is the way, but....&rdquo; The people who received the recovery, who received Brother Nee&rsquo;s teaching, would carry out what he taught in their own way. Everyone had his own way to carry out the same kind of teaching. It is ridiculous to think that this kind of practice could be successful. If a car has five occupants and everyone of them is the driver, how could the car go? Many times, the ones who are not driving the car are full of opinions; they are &ldquo;back seat drivers.&rdquo; When you take a ride and you are not the driver it is best not to voice your opinion. Let the one who is driving be free to drive according to his judgment.</p>
<p>From 1922 to 1942 in mainland China there was &ldquo;the one car&rdquo; of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, yet there were different drivers. When I came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in 1932, I saw how Brother Nee suffered because of this, but up to 1942 and 1943 by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy a great revival was taking place in Chefoo through the one accord among the serving ones there. After the war, I had the opportunity to come together with Brother Nee in Shanghai, and I related to him all that happened during the years I was in Chefoo. He confirmed all that we practiced, and encouraged me to carry on the same thing. We must realize that to carry out the same thing we need the one accord. From the fall of 1946 to the spring of 1949, for two and a half years, the whole situation in Shanghai was under my driving. Then the impact was seen again to some extent. To some extent there was one car with one driver. The Lord was going on in those two and a half years and there was a revival which brought Brother Nee back to the ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR EXPERIENCE IN TAIWAN</h2>
<p>I was then sent to Taiwan in 1949 and when I started the work there, I dropped every point which I had seen and learned that was not practical. In the first six years we had a hundredfold increase, from about four hundred to more than forty thousand. The impact was there. Even today all the churches in Taiwan still live on that foundation. They are still standing on the riches brought into the church life throughout those six years. Soon after this six-year period, the brothers were influenced to invite Brother T. Austin-Sparks from England to render us more spirituality, and his coming brought in a big factor of dissension. We invited him the first time in 1955 and again in 1957. From 1955 until recently in Taiwan the impact had never come back.</p>
<p>When I was going back to Taiwan in October of 1984, I realized how the one accord, the morale, was lost in Taiwan and how the morale was also lost to some extent in the United States. I made the decision to go back to Taiwan since that was the place where the Lord&rsquo;s recovery started abroad. I had to go there to have a new start. This new start is absolutely different. The brothers from the United States who joined the gospel preaching there can testify that it is one hundred percent different from our present way to preach the gospel, and it works. Recently sixteen gospel teams were sent out from the church in Taipei to nearby villages. Within only twenty-one days one thousand nine hundred and seventy-five people were baptized. They did not use any gimmicks. They used prayer, the Spirit, and the Word, and they had the one accord. They had one mind and one will with one purpose in one heart and in one soul. No doubt, they had the morale.</p>
<p>One policeman came to maintain order when he saw a crowd gathering. Within a short time he was baptized and sat there to listen to the first lesson of the new life series. One particular person was saved on the street with no place to baptize him. The saints knocked on the door of a nearby house, thinking that this might be a house of somebody who would listen to the gospel. They asked the person who answered if they could borrow their bathroom. This person gave them permission and while the people in the house were eating lunch, the saints went to their bathroom to baptize this newly saved one. The family asked the saints what they were doing and the saints preached the gospel to them. Then the whole family was baptized. A number of these sixteen villages are now ready to have a church. The halls in Taipei are going to spread the church life to these nearby places.</p>
<p>When I went back to Taipei in 1984, fifty-two brothers were established to be elders and twenty-eight more were added later. There are also now over one hundred and thirty new full-timers in Taipei and most of them are college graduates. The church in Taipei is prepared to receive another two hundred fifty full-timers by June of 1986.</p><h2 class="head1">FORGETTING ABOUT OUR OLD WAY<br />
TO IMPROVE OUR PRACTICE</h2>
<p>We need to forget about our own way and our old way. I was once in this old way. I brought this way to Taiwan and to the United States, but now this way is too old. I am not contradicting myself but improving myself. The airplane manufacturers manufactured the DC-4 between 1947 and 1948. I traveled on a DC-4 when China first began to use it. When I first came to the United States, it took me over twenty-four hours from Taiwan. Today I can make this trip in less than twelve hours on a DC-10. Today, we have to forget about the DC-4 because we have the DC-10. This improved aircraft is by the same manufacturer.</p>
<p>We cannot change the globe, but we can improve our means of transportation around the globe. We cannot change the truth either, but we can improve our practice. Our practice in the past concerning the way to meet was somewhat influenced by the traditional way. We were born into and surrounded by traditional things which are hard for us to drop. The fact that we need to be asked by someone in the church meeting to read the Scriptures is not a good indication. Why would anyone of us not read the verses on the board spontaneously? Perhaps we are in our tradition, waiting for an assistant pastor to lead us in the Scripture reading. In the new move which is the up-to-date move of the Lord, we like to go back one thousand percent to the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONE ACCORD IN ROMANS,<br />
1 AND 2 CORINTHIANS, AND PHILIPPIANS</h2>
<p>The one accord revealed in the New Testament is a great matter. This is why Paul indicated to the saints in Rome that they had to take care of being in one accord (Rom. 15:5-6). There were many troubles in the church in Corinth, and the real factor of all these troubles was dissension. Some said that they were of Paul and appreciated him. Others said that they were of Apollos and probably appreciated his way to teach the Bible. Still others appreciated Peter (1 Cor. 1:12). This is disaccord, dissension. Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Corinthians has more problems in it than any other of his Epistles. There are at least ten problems in 1 Corinthians which all came out of the same source of disaccord, having different opinions and not speaking the same thing (1 Cor. 1:10).</p>
<p>In Corinthians Paul did not use the word one accord, but he did stress speaking the same thing. For one person to say that he is of Paul and another to say that he is of Apollos indicates that they are not speaking the same thing. We all have to say, &ldquo;I am of Christ.&rdquo; To say &ldquo;I am of Paul&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Apollos&rdquo; is just like Peter on the mount of transfiguration saying that he would make three tabernacles&mdash;one for Moses, one for Elijah, and one for Jesus. Then a voice came out of the cloud which overshadowed them: &ldquo;This is My Son, the Beloved. Hear Him! And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them, except Jesus only&rdquo; (Mark 9:7-8). We all need to speak the same thing. Why should Paul, Apollos, and Cephas be mentioned? This is why Paul asked the Corinthians, &ldquo;Has Christ been divided?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:13). In Paul&rsquo;s second Epistle to the church in Corinth he also charged them to &ldquo;think the same thing&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:11). In his letter to the Philippians Paul likewise charged the saints to think the same thing (2:2; 4:2).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CRUCIAL NEED TODAY&mdash;<br />
THE RECOVERY OF THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>If you are going to do something to follow what the Lord has been doing and is still doing in Taiwan, the first thing you must do is to recover the one accord. Before this is recovered, do not do anything else. Without the one accord you are altogether not qualified to do anything in the Lord&rsquo;s new start of His new move. The Lord&rsquo;s church, His Body, His testimony, has been altogether cut into pieces by the Christians through the centuries not being in one accord. Many know the Lord and know the Bible to some extent, but they would not be in one accord. Where is the one accord? It is hard to see such a thing in Christian history, so the Lord has suffered.</p>
<p>Today we are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and especially we are in His new move, His up-to-date move. We must see that the crucial need today is the recovery of this one accord. If this is not among us, we are through. Then you may say that the Lord will go to others, but it is hard for Him to go to others. The ancient Chinese did not like either the soldiers or the police, so they had a proverb which basically said, &ldquo;If you leave the soldiers and come to the policeman, what is the difference?&rdquo; The two are about the same. For the Lord to leave &ldquo;the soldier&rdquo; and go to &ldquo;the policeman&rdquo; is about the same. Where could the Lord go then? In a sense, the Lord becomes &ldquo;pitiful&rdquo; because of us. He has nowhere to go, and He has come to us. He has been &ldquo;pitiful&rdquo; for years.</p>
<p>There was some kind of morale among us, but it has been nearly lost. We have many good teachings, we have the ground of the church, and we have all the divine provisions, but our morale is a problem. What is the problem? The problem is that we have nearly lost the one accord. Among the churches there is the lack of one accord. Even among the elders in one church, there is the lack of one accord. Among the saints in one locality there is also the lack of one accord. It is the same among the co-workers. Everywhere there is a lack of one accord. We say that we all are in the recovery, we are for the recovery, and we are with the ministry. We say this, but this may just be our slogan. Where is the one accord?</p>
<p>The one accord is the need. Do not think about others concerning this matter of the one accord. Think about yourself, your share, your portion in this matter. We do not have much morale because we are lacking the one accord, yet we still want to practice the things that the Lord has shown us in His recovery. We may practice them, yet with no impact, no livingness, and in other words, without much fruit.</p>
<p>From 1970 to 1972 the migration of the saints to new places had the impact, but not today. I am quite concerned for the recent migrations to other cities. Do they have the one accord there or not? If we do not have the one accord, whether or not we migrate makes little difference. If there is no morale, to have an army or not to have an army makes little difference. What makes an army different is its morale. Do we have the morale in the church in our locality? Those of you who migrated to another place must ask yourselves if you have the one accord. If not, you have destroyed your migration. You will waste your time in being there. To have the home gatherings without the one accord means nothing. To go out to visit others to distribute the booklets needs the one accord. Without the one accord, all our doings will be in vain.</p>
<p>We must realize that the practices in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are not matters for others to copy. You must have the life. To do anything you need the life. You have to see what the landmark was of the one hundred twenty in the book of Acts. The landmark that divides the Gospels and the Acts was not the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The landmark was the one accord of the one hundred twenty. If you want to experience the baptism in the Spirit, you must have the one accord. If all the members of a local church have the one accord, the baptism in the Spirit will be there. If you really want to practice the proper way to preach the gospel, you need the one accord. Without this key, no door can be opened. The one accord is the &ldquo;master key to all the rooms,&rdquo; the master key to every blessing in the New Testament. This is why Paul told Euodias and Syntyche that they needed this one accord (Phil. 4:2). Paul knew that these sisters loved the Lord, but that they had lost the one accord.</p>
<p>What we need is to recover this one accord. If we mean business to go along with the Lord&rsquo;s present day move, we need this one accord. Who is right does not mean anything; we need this one accord. We need to have the same mind and the same will for the same purpose with the same soul and the same heart. Philippians tells us that this matter starts from our spirit (1:27), yet we must realize we are not persons of spirit only. We are persons also of the mind, will, purpose, soul, and heart. For us to be in the same one spirit with the same one soul, one mind, and one will is to have the one accord, which is the key to all the New Testament blessings and bequests. Otherwise, we will repeat the pitiful history of Christianity by being another group of Christians repeating the same kind of disaccord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE THREE SUBSTANCES OF THE POWER<br />
IN THE RECOVERY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 1:8; 4:31; 6:7; 12:24; 19:20</h1>
<p>The book of Acts begins with the one accord and stresses the one accord. The early disciples could not have maintained or kept this one accord, however, if they had had different ways, means, agents, or substances for them to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s move on this earth. If we read through the entire book of Acts, we can see that the way they took to carry out God&rsquo;s move on this earth to fulfill His New Testament economy was entirely by three main substances&mdash;prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. Not only in Acts but also throughout the entire New Testament, prayer, the Spirit, and the Word were used for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy. The different groups in Christianity today use many other ways. This is why I do not feel that it would be a profit to the move of the Lord in the recovery to establish schools or other things like this. This might be a distraction that keeps the churches somewhat different. If we have different ways to do things, it is hard to keep the one accord. In order to maintain the unique one accord we all have to learn to do the same thing by the same way. The substances which constitute the unique way for the Lord&rsquo;s move are prayer and the Spirit, which result in the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD GROWING AND MULTIPLYING</h2>
<p>Acts never tells us that the Spirit grew and multiplied but that the Word grew and multiplied. There are three sections in the book of Acts concerning the move of the Lord through His Word. Chapter six is the end of the first section where it says the word of God grew (v. 7). Chapter twelve is the end of the second section and tells us that &ldquo;the word of God grew and multiplied&rdquo; (v. 24). Then Paul&rsquo;s ministry began in chapter thirteen. Finally, chapter nineteen is the end of another section, telling us that &ldquo;the word of the Lord grew mightily and was strong&rdquo; (v. 20). The Lord&rsquo;s move eventually is not to have something resulting in the Spirit. What we do actually is to carry the Word to people. The Word is the real contents, the real constituents of the New Testament economy of God. God&rsquo;s Word constitutes the New Testament Bible and also constitutes the very New Testament economy of God. We should pray that we may have the Spirit as power to spread the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GETTING CONSTITUTED WITH THE WORD</h2>
<p>We have to pick up the Word to an even greater extent than Peter did. Peter probably did not have a share, as we do, in the fourteen Epistles written by Paul and in the book of Revelation written by John. This is why he charged the saints in his later ministry to take whatever the Apostle Paul wrote (2 Pet. 3:15-16). In John 16 the Lord told Peter and all his companions that He had many things to say to them which they could not have borne at that time. He said that they had to wait for the Spirit of reality to come for further speaking (vv. 12-13). Mostly, the Holy Spirit spoke in continuation of the Lord Jesus through Paul on the New Testament economy of God. The word spoken by the Lord Himself directly to Peter is mostly in the four Gospels. After Pentecost, the Lord spoke to all His people mainly through the Apostle Paul in his Epistles. Peter with all his companions had to pick up mainly what was recorded in the Gospels, but today we have to pick up much more. We have to pick up the words of the Lord from the four Gospels and especially from the fourteen Epistles of the Apostle Paul. After giving Life-study Messages on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, the first thing we published in collective volumes was our Life-studies on Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles because we consider that his Epistles are more crucial for us to know God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>For us to know the Lord Jesus in His earthly ministry we surely need the four Gospels. To know His birth, His youth, His living and ministry on this earth, His death, resurrection, and ascension we have to pick up the record in the four Gospels. But for us to know the definition, the full revelation, of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy concerning the Body of Christ, we surely have to pick up the fourteen Epistles of Paul. The four Gospels show us the Head, while Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles show us the Body and reveal the Head to us in an even deeper way. Because we are living in the Body today under the direction of Christ as our living Head, these fourteen Epistles are more crucial to us.</p>
<p>I charged the new full-timers in Taiwan to spend half a day, every day, in the Word. This is a must. Even when they were out preaching the gospel to the villages, they still spent the first half of the day praying together in the Word. They even brought their Life-studies with them. They always study the Word regularly according to their schedule. If these young ones do not have an adequate constitution of the Word, they will have nothing to present to others regardless of how much they pray. But the full-timers in Taiwan have something when they open up their mouth because they have been studying the New Testament in the Recovery Version with all the notes and the Life-study Messages. They are full of the divine revelation. They are full of the divine Word. They have much to say, and this is quite convincing when they meet other Christians. They open up the Recovery Version and give away some booklets and Life-studies; thus, many get attracted and would even like a copy of the Recovery Version for themselves.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING THE HIGHER GOSPEL, THE RICHER WORD</h2>
<p>By going out to the small villages, they baptized one thousand nine hundred seventy-five within three weeks. The main reason for this is that they preached the gospel with a higher, richer word. The Word works. If a farmer sows nothing or even if he sows some poor seed, what kind of harvest can he expect? We need to speak the higher gospel, the richer word, which is very logical and philosophical and which meets the need of the modern, young people in this age.</p>
<p>The young people today, generally speaking, are very philosophical and scientific. The more scientific and logical people become, the more they want to know the meaning of human life. The age has changed and is much different from one hundred years ago. When the missionaries went to China, the people there were very conservative. They did not have much knowledge and only were concerned with ethics and with doing something to make a living. But today people all over the globe have become very educated and are very philosophical and logical. If you were only to tell them that they are sinners who are going to hell, they would not like to hear this. They are bored of this. Within them there is a desire to know the deeper truths, the real meaning of this universe, the real meaning and reason of human life.</p>
<p>When our brothers went out to preach the gospel in this way, it convinced people. Even those people in the villages had heard the preaching of Christianity before. To their opinion after hearing this preaching, they only considered this as another religion like Buddhism. To many of them the philosophical teachings of Confucius are much better than the mere preaching of going to heaven or hell. When our young people went to them, the people in the villages were so impressed that they were college graduates. They would surely listen to someone coming to their home who had graduated from the top university in Taiwan. These full-timers going to the villages had an impact.</p>
<p>Today the United States is the top country on this earth. The young people today on the campuses are seeking more knowledge concerning human life and the reality of the universe, yet superficial knowledge will not fill up the void within them. They would like to know the truth of the universe, the real meaning, the real significance, of human life. We have what they need. We have a proper translation of the New Testament with notes that open up the text, many booklets for distribution and many truths to speak. These truths have to be our constitution. We have to be saturated and soaked with all these divine realities. Then we need to go out to speak with our Recovery Version and with our pockets or handbags full of the rainbow booklets, which contain a slightly edited version of the Life-study Messages. When you are speaking the high gospel to someone, after a certain point give them a booklet. This really means something. Thank the Lord that He has given us a rich deposit of His Word. The early believers went out not only with the Spirit, but even the more with the Word. The Spirit by Himself is too abstract. We can minister the Spirit to others, but we cannot present the Spirit. What we can present in a thorough way is the Word.</p>
<p>One particular brother told me that he recently met a group of Jewish young people who are seeking the truth. I told this brother that if he is going to convince these Jewish young people, he must know how to use the Old Testament because they treasure it to the uttermost. They boast of the Old Testament even though they may know very little about it. The best way to catch them is to use their treasure. First open to Genesis 12 and read to them God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham that in his seed all the nations of the earth would be blessed (v. 3; cf. Gen. 22:18). Ask them who this seed is in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed. When you open up the Bible in this way they will be shocked. Then you need to give them an interpretation that this seed of Abraham is Christ. Read a portion of Matthew 1 to them showing them the ancestors of Jesus Christ: &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham. Abraham begot Isaac; and Isaac begot Jacob&rdquo; (vv. 1-2a). Then open to Galatians 3 and show them that this Christ is the very One in whom the entire world is blessed (vv. 14, 16). If this brother were to share the truth with these Jewish young people in this way week after week for a period of time, they would be convinced. We do not need to argue with anyone; just open up the holy Word to them. The most profitable way to convince people is to use the holy Word.</p>
<p>Nearly every nation on this earth today promotes their people being educated. All the educated people know that there is a unique and famous book called the Holy Bible. Every philosophical and logical person would like to know this book. They would even like to know this book as literature. If a person does not know something about the Bible, he may be considered as backward. I believe that once one gets educated there is a desire in his heart to know the Bible. If you go to a thoughtful, educated person and open up some crucial verses to them to show them what this book teaches, he would be happy to hear you. You should go to them with prayer and with the Spirit to present the Word. Then the Word will be living. Because we go with prayer, the Spirit, and the Word, something will surely happen.</p>
<p>Many thoughtful persons would like to know something about the book of Revelation because they are curious. If you cannot share with them from this book, you will lose their interest. After reading the first verse of the New Testament, a thoughtful person may ask you the significance of &ldquo;the book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham&rdquo; (Matt. 1:1). This question is a real testing. If you say that you do not know, you cannot capture this person. Many curious questions would be asked of you when you go to contact logical people, so you must be prepared by having a deposit of the rich Word in your being. Your preaching of the high gospel will be very convincing and will gain the respect, the regard, of the one to whom you are speaking. Our goal, though, is not merely to get regard from people. We want to sow the Word into people&rsquo;s minds and hearts and eventually this Word will be used by the Holy Spirit to get into their spirit to regenerate them. This is why it is altogether worthwhile for us to study the Word.</p><h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING THE ONE ACCORD<br />
BY PRAYER, THE SPIRIT, AND THE WORD</h2>
<p>Instead of using our hall to establish a school or as some kind of center to take care of children, we need to spend our time on the Word and to contact people. There are thousands of Chinese families in many major cities in the United States who would be open to our visitation. Even though many brothers have a job, they can still use their evenings and weekends to visit these families door to door. To go to visit them in prayer by being prepared with the holy Word and filled with the Spirit will be very prevailing. To use the church meeting hall for a school or as a center to care for children will bring a lot of complications to the hall. The children will have to be controlled, a playground will have to be prepared for them, and a substantial amount of the day will be occupied by them in which the hall will not be free for the church&rsquo;s purpose. All the churches should use every inch of the hall for studying the Word and for prayer to receive the Spirit to bring people to the hall that they may get saved.</p>
<p>To maintain the one accord we must take one way for our driving. If we have different ways to drive surely our one accord will be somewhat damaged. In the New Testament there is only this one unique way constituted with these three substances&mdash;prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. Apparently, to use the hall as a place to care for children is not something distracting or making division. But after a while, some saints who have given quite much will not agree with the hall being used for that purpose. It may also be that some of the elders may feel to have a meeting during a time which has already been designated for the purpose of the children. We all have to try to do everything that would not bring in this kind of dissenting effect or thought. Whatever you do by prayer, whatever you do to get the Spirit, and whatever you do to take the Word, no one would dissent with.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother would propose that we use a certain kind of music to preach the gospel. Some may feel good about this but others may not. No one, however, would have different opinions concerning prayer, concerning the Spirit, and concerning taking the Word and preaching the Word. This is the unique way everybody knows because this is God&rsquo;s ordained way. This is not the way I invented or taught, but the way God invented and ordained in the Bible. We need to take this principle in all our practices. Try the best to always limit and restrict your practice by the Word. Whatever the Word does not say, it is better not to take. To preach the gospel by any way other than prayer, the Spirit, and the Word may cause some different thinking.</p>
<p>People would take another way because they do not want to spend that much time in the Word. To take other ways besides prayer, the Word, and the Spirit are short-cut ways for the sake of convenience. We cannot be entirely successful by taking a short-cut way. The genuine way, the proper way, the most profitable way to take is the unique way. The unique way in doing anything is God&rsquo;s ordained principle. The entire universe is full of principles set up by God, the Creator. If you are going to be married, you must take God&rsquo;s ordained way with the principle of marriage of one husband and one wife (Matt. 19:3-9). If you take a short-cut way, you will get in trouble. In our world and in the universe there are many God-ordained principles. Science actually discovers all these God-ordained principles.</p>
<p>To use other ways to preach the gospel or to carry the church on might be profitable, but that is the short-cut way. The short-cut way will always have some side effects. Only the proper way will never have any side effects. The best medical doctors are careful not to release any medicine that may have harmful side effects. Therefore, we should not use anything other than prayer, the Word, and the Spirit to carry on the gospel or the church life. Otherwise, we should be prepared for some side effects like dissension, which will damage the real one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TOILING IN THE WORD, LABORING IN PRAYER,<br />
AND BEING DILIGENT IN DEALING<br />
WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It may seem very awkward to take the genuine way. It takes time and patience; we have to labor and toil. Let us toil in the Word, labor in prayer, and be diligent in dealing with the Holy Spirit. This is worthwhile. We have to spend much time to get into the Word; we have to get ourselves saturated, constituted, and even soaked with the holy Word. We must also get ourselves constituted with our contact with the Lord. We have to contact Him day by day and hour after hour; then we will be the right person.</p>
<p>In 1958 I went to the Cow Palace in San Francisco to listen to Billy Graham&rsquo;s preaching. Some told me that Dr. Graham spent much of his time on his knees praying. That was the source of his impact. I admired the way he applied the Word to the present world situation in his preaching. If he had not had an adequate knowledge of the Word and had not spent an adequate amount of time in studying the Word, he could never have applied the Word so adequately and soberly to the present world situation. We all have to spend time in the holy Word.</p>
<p>If you are burdened to preach the gospel, you must get into the Word and be one who knows the Word. A person may be a manager of a bank or a college professor, but he still has to spend time in the Word. A professor may know a lot, but God is not asking him to present his studies to people. For you to go out to contact people, you need to know the holy Word. Then use all your available time to pray to contact the living Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">ASKING THE LORD TO BRING OUR ENTIRE BEING<br />
INTO THE LIGHT AND BEING DEALT WITH BY HIM<br />
TO BECOME A PERSON OF POWER,<br />
FULL OF THE SPIRIT WITHIN AND WITHOUT</h2>
<p>Do not merely ask God to give you the power; the power is waiting for you. You need to be cleansed, dealt with, purified, chastened, and chastised by the Lord. No elder or any brother can deal with or purify your inward being. Only the Lord Himself can deal with you directly. You need to give Him the way in your being every day. Just as we need to wash our hands frequently, we also need to be cleansed by the Lord frequently. To handle the gospel is a most holy thing. This could never be done by anyone whose hands are dirty. We need to come to the Lord and open our entire being to Him to be dealt with, to be enlightened, to be exposed, to be checked, and to be humbled. The power comes from this kind of prayer.</p>
<p>We should not merely pray for the power. The power is there to be appropriated by you, but who are you, what are you, and where are you? You may be dirty, never dealt with, proud, criticizing others, offending your wife, despising the elders, and rebelling against the church. You may be feeble in this way, and yet still be zealous for the gospel. You cannot be a prevailing one to preach the gospel if you are this kind of person. If you are going to be a prevailing one, you need to go to the Lord every day to get yourself adjusted, cleansed, enlightened, exposed, and rebuked, not by man&rsquo;s words but by the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit directly. The Lord has no chance to deal with you unless you pray.</p>
<p>When you pray, do not be occupied with your work or with other things. Do not even be occupied with gospel preaching. You have to keep yourself absolutely free and open to the Lord. Leave yourself open to the Lord. Let Him come in for at least ten minutes to speak to you, to enlighten you, to point out to you all your shortcomings, sinfulness, evil, and impure thoughts. Ask Him to bring your entire being into the light for a full and utter exposure of your real condition. This kind of prayer would make you prevailing. You do not need to pretend that you are powerful. As a purified and chastised person, when you open up your mouth, every word will be a word of power. Whatever comes out of your mouth will be powerful. Even your voice will be powerful because your person will be power. This will be the case because through your prayer you have been saturated by the cleansing One.</p>
<p>The One who cleanses you is also the One who purifies and saturates you. As a person saturated with the Lord, you will be empowered. This is why a word spoken by one person is powerful, and the same word spoken by another means nothing. Prayer makes your person. Prayer makes you another person, a person of power. Such a person of prayer will be full of the Spirit within and without.</p>
<p>When you go to contact others, as a person who is full of power and full of the divine revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, the impact will be there. When you go, you must have the unique one accord backing you. You should be one with the church, one with your co-workers, one with all the brothers, and one with all the sisters. You should mean business with the Lord. If you are such a person and if you are not carrying out something on your own and for yourself in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the impact will surely be there.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING SOMETHING HIGH TO PRESENT TO PEOPLE</h2>
<p>I came to the United States when I was nearly sixty with little knowledge of English in speaking. But I believe that since the first day I came to this country I was somewhat empowered, despite the fact that my English may not have been good and my speaking may not have been eloquent. D. L. Moody did not have a high education. He was helping his uncle in a shoe store when the Lord called him to preach the gospel. Once after he preached to a large congregation, a learned person told him that his grammar was wrong. Moody frankly told that person to go to preach with his correct grammar and then see what would come out. The power, the impact, is not in the right grammar. It is in what kind of person you are and what you present to people. People do not want the proper grammar. They want the right thing. They want life. They want Christ. They want the reality of salvation.</p>
<p>The impact with me through the years is in prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. Although I am not so skilled in singing, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I have composed a number of good hymns. One of them, Hymn 501 in our hymnal, &ldquo;O glorious Christ, Savior mine,&rdquo; is actually much better in Chinese because nearly every line is poetic. Recently, I was in a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting in a certain locality, and all the hymns sung in that meeting except for one were written by me. The one that was not written by me was the hymn with the chorus, &ldquo;One with Thee, one with Thee&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> 474). This hymn was written altogether with my ministry by a sister who got much constituted with my ministry. This was another factor to convince me that we need a new hymnal, dropping all the substandard hymns we do not use out of our present hymnal. Fifty years ago Hymn 226, written by the Brethren, &ldquo;We give Thee thanks, O Lord,&rdquo; was a treasure to me. But today this treasure has lost its color and taste. This is a very good hymn, but it is not that rich. It is not as rich as Hymn 132&mdash;&ldquo;Lo! in heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned.&rdquo; Verse six of this hymn is especially rich:</p>
<p class="hbody">With the Glorified in heaven<br />
 Is the Church identified;<br />
By the Spirit of this Jesus<br />
 Are His members edified.</p>
<p>My point is that when we go out, we need to have something high to present to people. This is why I am not bothered by the opposition. I consider myself as a seller of the oil (Matt. 25:9). If you want to buy the oil, come to me. My English may not be eloquent or grammatical, but the oil and the divine riches are here in this ministry. I am not boasting, but I am challenging you to get into the Word. Take the unique way of prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. Do not think of anything else and do not use any gimmicks. Get yourself constituted, qualified, and equipped. Then go out in your prayer with the Spirit presenting the Word. Many will get convinced. The seeking people are eager to listen to someone who can tell them what the reality of human life is. This is what they need, and this is what we have. We need many saints to go and present the divine truths the Lord has shown us to the needy people. Do not think of taking a way other than prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. Any other way will cause dissension and division.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ONE IN:</h1>
<p>TEACHING &mdash; 1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; 16:1; Acts 2:42; Rom. 16:17; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 6:3; Eph. 4:13-14</p>

<p>ESSENCE, APPEARANCE, EXPRESSION &mdash; Rev. 1:11-12</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DOCTRINAL ONENESS</h2>
<p>The verses listed above show us a oneness in seven aspects: teaching, practice, thinking, speaking, essence, appearance, and expression. These aspects are not a doctrinal oneness, but a oneness in our practice. There are another seven items concerning our oneness in doctrine: one God, one Lord, one Spirit, one church, one recovery, one testimony, and one work. The first three &ldquo;ones&rdquo; are the Triune God. Nearly all of us would agree with the seven aspects of oneness on the doctrinal side. If anyone would have a dissenting spirit, mind, or attitude concerning these seven aspects of the doctrinal oneness, it might be concerning the last one&mdash;the work. We may say that the work belongs either to doctrine or to practice. I like to classify the work on the doctrinal side because through my continuous observation I have discovered that few among us would dare to say that they are doing a work separate from the unique work for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We all agree with this sevenfold oneness doctrinally concerning the one God, the one Lord, the one Spirit, the one church, the one recovery, and the one work.</p>
<p>Among the many denominations and groups in Christianity, none would dare to say that they have two Gods, two Lords, or two Spirits. They would argue doctrinally, however, concerning the church. They would say that we are all one church, but that in practice it is impossible to have one church. To them it is necessary to have many churches&mdash;the Chinese church in the Philippines, in Malaysia, in Indonesia, in Thailand, and in California, and even the Anglican church in China. When I was a young boy, I wondered how the church of England could be in China. The various denominations and other groups in Christianity do not have the standing to proclaim &ldquo;one church.&rdquo; They have to admit to having different churches. The Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Arminian, and Protestant churches are the four major groups. Some among the Protestant churches are named after a leader such as the Lutheran and Wesleyan churches.</p>
<p>Every kind of denomination bears its own testimony. The Baptist church testifies for baptism by immersion, and the Presbyterian church bears the testimony of their presbytery system to manage and administrate their churches. The Episcopal churches bear a testimony of controlling their churches by a hierarchy of bishops (bishop, from Latin <em>episcopus</em>). This hierarchy also was adopted by the Catholic church, which has the pope at the top of its hierarchy. Because of all these different testimonies, there are spontaneously different kinds of works. There are different churches with different testimonies by different works. We do not admit that there are many churches in existence. All those &ldquo;churches&rdquo; are not churches in reality but denominations. They are denominated sects. They are not the testimony of Jesus which John refers to in Revelation (1:2, 9; 12:17; 19:10; 20:4). According to the Bible, we can only recognize that there is one church, with one testimony by one recovery today. We have to admit to there being one God, one Lord, one Spirit, one church, one testimony, and one recovery. Also, it is impossible for us to have more than one work. There must be one work on the earth today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL ONENESS</h2>
<p>I fully realize that there is nearly no problem among us concerning these seven aspects of the doctrinal oneness, but I also realize that we do have problems concerning the sevenfoldness of the practical oneness. I am concerned that not many of us have thought about the seven aspects of the practical oneness. I believe that the people in the recovery are thoughtful. In the recovery there should not be anyone who is unreasonable, illogical, unthoughtful, or unfair. As those who are reasonable, logical, thoughtful, and fair, I would ask you to consider these seven aspects listed at the beginning of this chapter.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us we need to be one in teaching, practice, speaking, and even thinking. Some may feel that this is too much and that this is the controlling of people&rsquo;s thinking. They may feel that this is not workable in such a democratic age, especially in a country like the United States. The Americans practice democracy and grow up in an environment where nearly everybody expresses his own feeling. None of us should follow the recovery blindly, foolishly, or ignorantly. We need a sober consideration of the truth in the Bible. One may consider that to be one in speaking is somewhat against the First Amendment of freedom of speech. If you want to remain in your status as an American citizen, you are through with the recovery because the recovery does not practice many speakings. The recovery only allows one kind of speaking. I have a question as to whether or not we in the recovery are really one in speaking.</p>
<p>The last three items we need to be one in practically are related to the golden lampstands in Revelation 1:11-12. The seven lampstands do not have more than one essence and one substance. The pure gold is the unique substance of the lampstands. Within one substance there can only be one essence. All the lampstands should furthermore be one in appearance. At this point in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, I seriously question whether all the churches have the same appearance. The lampstands all have one substance, which is gold, and they all have one form, one shape. The seven lampstands are identical in appearance. If you do not number them, it is impossible to tell them apart. They all look exactly the same.</p>
<p>The Brethren insisted on having separated local assemblies, and they even taught that all the local assemblies should not resemble one another to encourage them to be different. That was their boast. Sometimes they purposely practiced something to show people that one assembly was different from another. They wanted to show people that they were not catholic. They said that the churches having a uniform appearance was something of the Catholic church. They say that the churches should be different based upon the fact that each epistle to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 is different from the others. This is absolutely right. All seven epistles are different from one another, but they are different in negative things. The particular characteristic of the church in Ephesus was the loss of the first love (2:4). The church in Pergamos became worldly; worldliness was their particular characteristic (2:13). The specific, particular characteristics of the apostate church in Thyatira were Jezebel, idol worship, fornication, and adultery (2:20-22). The characteristic of the church in Sardis was deadness (3:1), and the characteristic of the church in Laodicea was lukewarmness (3:16).</p>
<p>The churches are different from one another in negative things, but the lampstands in Revelation 1, among whom Christ as the Head was walking, are altogether identical. They all look the same. They are uniquely one in their essence, in their appearance, in their form, and in their expression. Each lampstand has seven lamps to express it, and all the seven expressions are uniquely identical. Do we follow the negative side or do we stand for the positive side? Based upon the wrong teaching of the Brethren, their assemblies are encouraged to have different appearances. This kind of poison may still remain unconsciously or subconsciously in the minds of some of us. Some may doubt or question the fact that the appearance of the churches should be the same, thinking that we are going to unify all the local churches to carry on a kind of so-called catholic church.</p>
<p>My burden is to look into the real situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery regarding the practices. We have to study this. We are not carrying out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in a way to blind people&rsquo;s eyes. We are doing our best to open everyone&rsquo;s eyes. I have been kept in the recovery for over half a century with much consideration and observance. If you believe the Bible, you have to admit that we should be one in teaching, practice, thinking, speaking, essence, appearance, and expression. There is not a verse in the Bible that even gives us a small hint that allows the churches to have different appearances. Some may say that God does not care for the appearance, but Paul tells us to abstain from the appearance, from the form, of evil (1 Thes. 5:22). Even in sinful things God takes care of the appearance. If a brother stays in a closed, dark, and even locked room with a female for three hours, he may still declare he has a pure conscience and is not sinful. God knows the heart, but other people do not. Because God cares for the appearance, He tells us to abstain from every form of evil. God not only cares for the essential and substantial reality of the lampstand but also for its shape, its form. It has to be in the shape of a lamp; otherwise, it cannot be called the lampstand. The recovery must have a proper appearance; otherwise, it is not the recovery.</p>
<p>The recovery does not have a creed. From the very beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in mainland China, Brother Nee declared that the Bible with its sixty-six books was our creed. The recovery does not have different, single doctrines. It only has one whole Bible. We have come back to the Bible. There were two slogans practiced by the Brethren in their early days&mdash;back to the Body and back to the Bible. They used these slogans but did not practice them in full. Then they set up their teachings. We do not like to set up our teachings, but we like to open up the pure Word of God to the Lord&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>The local churches having one appearance today is doubtful and questionable. I also have a question concerning the churches bearing one expression. What kind of expression do the brothers from Germany, England, Brazil, and Taiwan see when they come to the churches in the United States? Do they see the same one expression? If they do not, we are not properly compressed into the golden lampstands because all seven lampstands bear one, unique expression. There is no difference at all between the expression of these seven lampstands. Their expressions are also uniquely identical. I heard from some that certain places in the United States have different tastes and different colors. If we have different colors and tastes, we unconsciously annul what we proclaim to be.</p>
<p>I want to have a thorough fellowship with you concerning what I have seen in the recovery. Many of you can testify that the recovery I brought to the United States was altogether one in teaching, in practice, in thinking, in speaking, in essence, in appearance, and in expression. Although we are not promoting a so-called catholic church, the denotation, connotation, and significance of the word &ldquo;catholic&rdquo; is altogether proper. The word catholic, however, was damaged and applied wrongly. We are not promoting anything of that kind of apostate Catholic church, but we are here carrying out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery of the proper church life. According to our over sixty years of study, the proper church life has to be one in teaching, practice, thinking, speaking, essence, appearance, and expression. You may proclaim that what you do and what you stand for is the recovery, but the way of your thinking, speaking, practice, appearance, and expression annuls your declaration. It does not confirm your declaration. The recovery does not bear more than one expression. What do people see, taste, and smell when they come to your locality?</p>
<p>When some rose up to oppose the ministry in 1959 in Taiwan, I told them that I sacrificed my whole life for the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and would never change my way. I told them that if they did not feel that this was the right way, they should take their own way. I also said that they should not remain in the recovery pretending to be something. At that time, I was giving a message on John 2 where the Lord told the Jews, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (v. 19). I told the saints that if this is my work it has to be torn down, but if this is the work of the Lord you cannot tear it down. The more you tear down this work, the more this work will be resurrected.</p>
<p>It has been twenty-seven years since I spoke that word, and history has shown that those who opposed the ministry were divided again and again. I warned them that if they would not take my word, they would be divided endlessly, and this has been the history. The work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, though, on the island of Taiwan has been solidly founded and very much blessed by the Lord. I cannot protect the Lord&rsquo;s divine glory. Only He Himself can do that. What I can do is to bring the recovery to you all and tell you the truth concerning the different aspects of the recovery. This is my word of love, my word of warning. As those who are taking care of the churches and participating in the recovery, you have to realize the recovery of the genuine church life is altogether, absolutely, wholly, and ultimately one in teaching, in practice, in thinking, in speaking, in essence, in appearance, and in expression.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE IN TEACHING</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 4:17, 7:17 and 16:1 indicates that Paul taught all the churches the same thing. All the churches were under one teaching, the teaching of the apostles (Acts 2:42). Whatever I have been teaching is the teaching of the apostles. I do not desire to pass on anything of myself, but whatever I have ministered is altogether according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. I do not have my own teaching. My teaching is a part of the apostles&rsquo; teaching, the unique teaching. The three thousand who were added to the church on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Paul carried on the same teaching. The Lord&rsquo;s word in John 16 tells us that He would have more to speak when He came back as the Spirit of reality (vv. 12-13). The teaching of the apostles was completed by Paul&rsquo;s teaching. Paul told us clearly in Colossians 1:25 that his ministry was to complete the word of God, which means to complete the teaching of the apostles, to complete the revelation of the New Testament. I had no part in this completion work so I do not add anything to the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>I must testify that the Lord has given me many visions (Ezek. 1:1; Acts 2:17), but not visions like those of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. The visions I have received all come from the printed pages of the Bible. I reject, condemn, and even curse any teaching that is not from or that is not according to these printed pages. I only take whatever is revealed in the Bible, so whatever I minister is not my teaching, but the apostles&rsquo; teaching. The apostles do not include me because the teaching of the apostles, who gave the complete revelation of God, has been fully completed.</p>
<p>After the final writing of John the Apostle, the book of Revelation, the entire divine revelation had been completed. It is in this final book that the Lord through John testifies concerning the words of this book: &ldquo;If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this book&quot; (Rev. 22:18-19). Only the book of Revelation declares this because this was the Lord Jesus&rsquo; declaration at the very end of His holy, divine revelation. After its completion, the Lord Jesus, the One who was qualified to open the scroll of the new covenant (Rev. 5:4-5), declares that this is the end. After the book of Revelation, no one has any position to add anything or to take away anything, because the divine revelation has been fully finished and completed.</p>
<p>Today very few would add something to the revelation, but many are deducting something. Too many deductions have transpired already. Some cut off any portion of the Word that does not fit their understanding. No doubt, they will suffer loss (1 Cor. 3:15). They will lose the participation in the tree of life and in the blessing of the eternal, holy city. I dare not add anything. Please do not think I am passing on my teaching. I dare not have any teaching. I am not teaching anything of my thought or my invention. I am teaching the Bible; I am teaching the teaching of the apostles. Paul instructed the church in Corinth to do what he had directed the churches of Galatia to do (1 Cor. 16:1), so all the churches under Paul&rsquo;s ministry were one in the apostles&rsquo; teaching (Acts 2:42).</p>
<p>Romans 16:17 tells us that some &ldquo;make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned.&rdquo; &ldquo;The teaching which you have learned&rdquo; is the teaching of the apostles. Since I came to the United States, whatever I have ministered to you has been something of the apostles&rsquo; teaching, and you have to learn of this. Be cautious of anyone who would cause you to practice in a way that is contrary to the teaching of the apostles.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 there are two main points: 1) do not teach differently; 2) the economy of God in faith. Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently. In other words, do not teach anything that differs from the apostles&rsquo; teaching. The apostles&rsquo; teaching is not the teaching on a particular doctrine like baptism by immersion. This is a little part of the apostles&rsquo; teaching, but it is not the main thing, the central lane. The main thing, the central lane, of the apostles&rsquo; teaching is God&rsquo;s economy, not the economy of the Old Testament of the law but God&rsquo;s economy in faith, His New Testament economy. The constituents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are the very Person of Christ, the very redemptive work of Christ, and the very reproduction of Christ and His work, the church.</p>
<p>I did not come to you to teach you baptism by immersion, tongue-speaking, healing, types, or prophecies. Many of you can testify that when I touch typology and prophecy, I touch them with much stress on Christ, on His redemptive work, and on His church, the Body, as the reproduction of His being and His work. These are the categories of all my teachings throughout the years. This is the teaching of the apostles. Any stress or emphasis on things other than these major items in the central lane have to be considered as different teachings.</p>
<p>If you read 1 Timothy 1 carefully, you can realize that what was condemned by the apostle as different teachings was not altogether heresy. They taught things from the Old Testament such as genealogies (v. 4) and the law given by God to Moses (vv. 7-8). The law is not heresy, but to teach the law is a different teaching from the teaching of the apostles. Different teachings stress something other than Christ and the church. To be one in teaching is to be uniquely one in the teaching of the apostles, not in the minor things such as the presbytery, the gifts, baptism by immersion, foot washing, head covering, or the ordinances of the Lord&rsquo;s table. We should not stress things which are not so crucial to the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We should not ignore them, but if we are taking care of the apostles&rsquo; teaching, they should not be the emphasis of our teaching.</p>
<p>First Timothy 6:3 says, &ldquo;If anyone teaches differently and does not consent to healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which is according to godliness.&rdquo; The healthy words are those of our Lord Jesus Christ. Has the Lord Jesus ever stressed baptism by immersion? Has He ever stressed healing? Has He ever stressed tongue-speaking, gifts, presbytery, foot washing, or head covering? The answer to these questions is no. John 14&mdash;17 and Matthew 5&mdash;7 and 24&mdash;25 are the stress of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching. These are the healthy words of the Lord Jesus. If anyone of us would stress something based upon the Scripture, yet other than what the Lord stressed, that would be a different teaching.</p>
<p>First Timothy 6:3 also refers to the teaching according to godliness. This is the teaching of the apostles after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, which is mainly Paul&rsquo;s teaching. First Timothy 3:16 tells us that the great mystery of godliness is God manifested in the flesh, which is first Christ and then the church as the continuation of Christ&rsquo;s manifestation of God in the flesh. The teaching which is according to godliness, the teaching of the Apostle Paul, is altogether regarding the church as the great mystery of godliness. First Timothy 6:3 covers the Lord&rsquo;s words in the four Gospels plus all that He has been speaking since His ascension through His apostles from Acts through Revelation. If we are teaching things other than what the New Testament stresses, we are teaching differently, and it will be hard for us to be really one. If we have many different teachings, we will also have many different practices resulting in division. It would then be impossible to have the one accord, the oneness.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4:13-14 the &ldquo;wind of teaching&rdquo; and &ldquo;the oneness of the faith&rdquo; are mentioned. The faith is the contents of the complete gospel according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Whatever the Lord spoke in the four Gospels and whatever He continued to speak in the Acts and in the Epistles through the apostles is the faith. The very contents of the New Testament Bible is the very contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy as the faith in which we have our belief. We all need to arrive at this faith, so we should not stress the different winds of different teachings. If you would be carried about by the winds of teaching, this indicates that you are still a babe according to Ephesians 4:14.</p>
<p>We are not for the teachings which can be considered as winds, but we are for the oneness of the unique faith which is the very contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. To have different teachings in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is altogether not authentic. We have to keep the principle of one teaching, not my teaching nor your teaching but the teaching of the apostles. Our one teaching has to be the teaching which is our faith, the very contents of which are the New Testament Bible, the very constituents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This is the teaching we should pass on, and this is the teaching all the churches should take and should remain in. By this way we surely can be one in one teaching. We will not carry out anything different which would produce different divisions.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE IN PRACTICE</h2>
<p>There are two portions in 1 Corinthians concerning head covering and concerning women&rsquo;s ministry which show us that we need to be one in practice. There were many different thoughts concerning the matter of head covering, but Paul told the saints in 11:16 not to be contentious concerning this: &ldquo;But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.&rdquo; The custom here is the custom of contention, disputation, and debating. Neither the apostles nor the churches tolerated any disputation concerning the apostles&rsquo; teaching. The plurality of the churches here indicates that all the local churches are independent of one another, yet they all act in the same way according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. The practice of all the churches should be uniquely one.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:33b-34 says, &ldquo;As in all the churches of the saints, let the women be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but let them be subject, as the law also says.&rdquo; This indicates that all the local churches should be the same in practice. This prohibition of the sisters speaking in the church means that women are not permitted to teach with authority concerning the defining of doctrine (cf. 1 Cor. 11:5; Acts 2:17-18; 21:9; 1 Tim. 2:12; see note 34<sup>2</sup> in 1 Corinthians 14&mdash;Recovery Version). The two practices concerning head covering and concerning women&rsquo;s ministry confirm that all the churches should be one in the same kind of unique practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE IN THINKING AND SPEAKING</h2>
<p>Romans 15:6 tells us that we should be &ldquo;with one accord and with one mouth.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;accord&rdquo; includes the mind, will, and purpose in the soul and the heart. We need to have one mind and one mouth. This means that we only have one Head because only the head has a mouth and a mind. We all take the Lord Jesus as the Head. Only He is fully qualified to have the mind and to have the mouth. We do not have the right because we are members of the Body. We do not have the mouth or the mind so we have to think with the mind of Christ (Phil 2:2, 5; 4:2). Then we have to speak with the mouth of the Head. The mouth only has one head.</p>
<p>If we considered this matter, we would not speak so loosely or freely; we would not speak whatever we like. You may like to speak something which the Head does not like. You are not the mouth. In the whole universe there is only one new man, and the one new man only has one Head with one Body. The mouth is not on the Body but with the Head. We must learn not to speak things so easily. Your speaking interferes with or profanes the mouth of the Head. You do not have any mouth. What the church has as the mouth is the mouth of the Head.</p>
<p>What does it mean that we all have one mind and one mouth? This means &ldquo;no longer I...but Christ lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20a). It is no more I, but Christ the Head that lives in me. He has a mouth, He has a mind, and I take Him as my person, so I would never use my mouth any longer to speak anything. Who could believe that so many millions of Christians with different languages could have one mouth? The Bible tells us this and we need to practice the one mouth to be one in speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE IN ESSENCE, APPEARANCE,<br />
AND EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>The sign of the lampstands in Revelation 1:11-12 shows us that the churches need to be one in essence, appearance, and expression. In the lampstand we can see the Father as the gold substance with the essence, the Son as the embodiment with a definite form, shape, and style, and the seven Spirits as the seven lamps expressing the lampstand. The lampstand is a very complete consummation of the Triune God. Every local church must be such an expression. The very essence of the substance of every church should be God the Father, and the form, the appearance, the shape, the style of every church must be the very embodiment of the Triune God, which is our dear Lord Jesus Christ. We should not have any other kind of appearance. Are we a group of people merely teaching others the Bible? Are we a group of people in evangelical activity? Are we a group of people teaching tongue-speaking and other gifts? Are we people who bear the testimony of the healing power? What is the appearance of your local church? It has to be the appearance of the all-inclusive Christ.</p>
<p>Every local church should be in the unique appearance, in the unique form, shape, and style of that unique One who is not only the Son of God, but also the Son of Man. The Son of God was His essence on this earth, and the Son of Man was His appearance. While He was walking on this earth, His very essence within was the Son of God and His appearance outwardly was the Son of Man. When He was walking among the lampstands, He was the Son of Man. John said that he saw &ldquo;One like the Son of Man&rdquo; (1:13). We must bear such an appearance. We must have such a shape, such a style, such a form, that is the real appearance, the form, of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>A local church should not have the appearance of Bible teachings. This might be a very good appearance, but it should not be the appearance of the local church. The local church&rsquo;s appearance should be uniquely the form, the style, and the shape of the Lord Jesus, the unique Son of Man. Then our expression must be the shining of the sevenfold, intensified Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. This is our expression, which is the very testimony of Jesus Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF ALL THE CHURCHES<br />
TO BE IDENTICAL</h1>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>The word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches&mdash;Rev. 2:1, 7 (seven times)</li>
<li>The solution made at Jerusalem was the decree for all the churches to keep&mdash;Acts 15:1-2, 13, 19-21, 22-23, 25-31; 16:4-5</li>
<li>The apostle&rsquo;s epistle to the Colossians was charged to be read by the Laodiceans, and the epistle to the Laodiceans to be read by the Colossians&mdash;Col. 4:16</li>
<li>The Gentile churches became imitators of the churches in Judea&mdash;1 Thes. 2:14a</li>
</ol>
<p>The points listed above are not my teaching but the teaching of the Bible in the New Testament, the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. My fellowship with you all is constituted with four things: 1) a lifelong study of the Bible for over sixty-one years; 2) a lifelong study of the biographies of spiritual giants that the Lord has raised up through all the centuries; 3) the history of the church including the raising up and the founders of different denominations, including the Orthodox church, the Catholic church, the Protestant&mdash; the state churches, private churches and the free groups; 4) my observation of the situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, in which I have been for over fifty-four years.</p>
<p>I would eventually like to fellowship four things with you which have been on my heart for a long time: the home gatherings, the full-timers, the truth lessons, and the spreading of the gospel in the unique, harmonious way (see Book 8 in this series). Without the fellowship in this book as a base, however, I would not like anyone to take my fellowship concerning these four things. My fellowship on these matters is based on my fellowship in this book. I do not want to be imitated by anyone who is not according to this fellowship. If you do not agree with any point of this fellowship, please stop copying anything I have done and will do in Taiwan.</p>
<p>I want to see the genuine, the proper, the up-to-date, and the most scriptural recovery. I have dedicated my whole life for this. I feel charged by the Lord to make a clear situation in His recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date recovery has been somewhat polluted by different opinions and practices during the past fifteen years, which we never agreed with from the very beginning. The only thing we exercised was toleration and patience with much hope and expectation that the ones who practice differently may have some improvement. We are not practicing Brethrenism, to cut off people. That is not our way. We will not cut off anyone, but we have the full right and position to say something about our practice. If you do not want to take one hundred percent of what I practice, please do not copy it.</p>
<p>When I entered into the recovery and was asked by Brother Nee, the leader in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, to join the work, I spent much time to consider whether I should enter into the work. Eventually I was clear that it was of the Lord, so I entered into the recovery, and participated in the work for the recovery. From that day until now I have not had any change nor will I have any change. Since I came out of mainland China over thirty-seven years ago, I have never changed my tone. I did not change at all in my teaching, even though I have passed through many trials. Many of you who have been under my ministry for years can testify that nothing has ever changed my attitude, my standing, my practice, my way, and my teaching.</p>
<p>Let us all be faithful to one another. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, I have the position to let you know my standing. If you feel this is the way, please stay with us honestly. I do not want to see a repetition of degraded Christianity in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I feel very burdened that the Lord must have a new start. I called for elders&rsquo; trainings in 1984 and 1985 in urgency and under much consideration. I called these gatherings, truthfully speaking, not for all of you but for some of you. In those two elders&rsquo; trainings every message was given for you. I also have called this elders&rsquo; training for certain dear brothers for whom I am greatly concerned. By your dissenting you may damage your future and damage the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In 1959 in Taiwan I warned some dissenting ones that they had the freedom to take their way but that in so doing they would damage their future and be divided endlessly. Whatever I said to them has become history. They damaged their spiritual future, damaged many others and experienced endless divisions.</p>
<p>We agree that there are only one God, one Spirit, one Lord, one church, one recovery, and one testimony. If this is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, it is unique. Regardless of who we are, if we would not take this way, we have no other way to go on. After those dissenting ones left the recovery, they were wandering. Consider objectively what other way there is for them to take. Is the church more than one? Is the testimony of the Lord more than one? Is God more than one? Is the Spirit more than one? Is the Lord more than one? Some left the recovery as gentlemen because they felt they could not take this way and made it clear that they wanted to take another way. They are gentlemen. I respect them and their ethics. Even these dear ones who left the recovery in a gentlemanly way had their spiritual future damaged. There has been no exception to this over the years.</p>
<p>Once a married female has a divorce, her entire human life has been damaged. Some people in America may remarry four or five times, but we know that in the eyes of God and even in the eyes of ethical persons, divorce is not the way of the proper human life. Once a female gets married she is committed for her life. If she divorces her husband, her human life is damaged. There is no other way for her to take. In like manner, if you leave the recovery, no one will curse you, but you will damage the way of your spiritual life. You will have no way to go on according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. In God&rsquo;s ordination, a woman should have only one husband. The Lord is our husband, and His way is our husband&rsquo;s way. If a woman does not take her husband&rsquo;s way, she complicates the way of her human life. This is my word of love, advice, and warning.</p>
<p>In the last chapter we saw from the holy Word that all the churches should be one in teaching, practice, thinking, speaking, essence, appearance, and expression. There is no loophole for any argument on these points unless you do not believe the Bible. All the Bible references for these points indicate that this is not my view, teaching, or opinion but simply my quotation from the divine Word. I want to honor you with my honesty in telling you the truth according to God from His holy Word. The Bible is our common ground, and my burden is to present to you the points of the divine Word.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF THE LORD TO ONE CHURCH<br />
BEING THE WORD SPOKEN BY THE SPIRIT<br />
TO ALL THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>The word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches (Rev. 2:1, 7). &ldquo;The word of the Lord&rdquo; is the word spoken by Him in Revelation 2 and 3. At the very beginning of His epistle to each church the Lord tells us His status. After declaring what He is, He speaks; but at the end of His speaking the Word says: &ldquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches&rdquo; (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). This word has been repeated seven times. The fact that the word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit not only indicates that He and the Spirit are one, but also that His word spoken to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches.</p>
<p>Suppose that the Lord spoke something to the church in Ephesus, but the church in Laodicea felt that their situation was different from Ephesus. They felt that they should pray to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading as to whether they should take the fellowship to Ephesus entirely or only take it partially to fit into their situation. Of course, there was not such a thing in Revelation 2 and 3, but I heard such a thing among us in today&rsquo;s recovery. This is dissension with a nice cloak. Some say, &ldquo;We receive the ministry, yet we would consider and pray to see how much the Lord will lead us to take of the ministry and how much it will fit in with our local situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wife could say to her husband, &ldquo;I love you and I take you as my husband, but whatever you say I have to bring to the Lord to see if it is really His leading for me. I need to pray to find out whether I should take your word wholly or in part and whether it fits in with my situation.&rdquo; If a wife had this attitude, how would her husband feel? Her attitude is a kind of subtle dissension, and her husband would not be able to tolerate it forever. I have been tolerating such an attitude from some, though, for the past fifteen years, but my toleration has ended.</p>
<p>We must see, I say again, that the word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches. The best church was Philadelphia, but even Philadelphia did not consider that she had to pray to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading as to whether she should take the Lord&rsquo;s word to the other churches wholly or partially and as to whether it fit into her local situation. There was not such a thing. We all need to stand in front of the mirror to see our face. As we look we may also see something of Christianity. Can the Lord&rsquo;s recovery be like this? Can the poor history of degraded Christianity be repeated in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? Should we not all throw the stone on any kind of subtle divorce?</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SOLUTION MADE AT JERUSALEM BEING<br />
THE DECREE FOR ALL THE CHURCHES TO KEEP</h2>
<p>The solution made at Jerusalem was the decree for all the churches to keep (Acts 15:1-2, 13, 19-21, 22-23, 25-31; 16:4-5). &ldquo;Decree&rdquo; is a strong word. The text in Acts 16:4 uses the word &ldquo;decrees.&rdquo; A decree is something more than a solution, instruction, teaching, or direction. Acts 15:1-2 shows us that there was a big problem, a big disturbance involving the Judaic practice of circumcision. This stirred up trouble among the churches, especially between the churches in the Gentile world and the churches in Judea. Even though the Apostle Paul was so much for the truth concerning the Gentiles, he still considered that the problem should not be settled in Antioch but with the church in Jerusalem. He did not make the decision to forget about Jerusalem or for the Gentile churches to put aside the Judaic practices regardless of the way the church in Jerusalem felt. If Paul would have practiced this way, he would have been sectarian. This would have meant that he practiced two Bodies of Christ on this earth&mdash;one Body in the Gentile world and another Body in Judea which he did not care for. Paul, however, realized that this was not the right way, so he, Barnabas, and certain others went to Jerusalem. It was not because Jerusalem was the headquarters of God&rsquo;s move nor because Jerusalem was the head church controlling other churches, that Paul, Barnabas, and certain others went to Jerusalem. It was because Jerusalem was the source from which the heretical teaching concerning circumcision came.</p>
<p>The conference held in Jerusalem was not merely a conference of the apostles and the elders. Acts 15:22 says, &ldquo;Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church...&rdquo; Not only were the apostles and elders there, but also the whole church. It was not a conference of the so-called top ones but it was &ldquo;with the whole church.&rdquo; Paul practiced the principle of the Body. This problem was not a matter of a certain region but a matter of the entire Body of Christ. Therefore, Paul went to Jerusalem to have a conference with all the concerned parties&mdash;the apostles, the elders, and the church in Jerusalem. Paul was practicing a Body principle. He was not sectarian to say that the churches in the Gentile world have nothing to do with those in Judea. He did not say, &ldquo;Let them take their way, and let us take our way.&rdquo; He went to Jerusalem to keep the Body principle and then a solution was made.</p>
<p>In the Life-study of Acts, I pointed out that the solution to Paul was not so satisfactory, but in order to keep the principle of the Body he took it. My basis for saying that the solution was not an absolutely satisfactory one is the content of James&rsquo; concluding word in Acts 15:19-21&mdash;&ldquo;Wherefore I judge that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who turn to God. But that we write to them to abstain from the pollutions of idols and fornication and what is strangled and blood. For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who proclaim him in the synagogues, being read every Sabbath.&rdquo; In James&rsquo; concluding word he took care of three main items of Judaism&mdash;the law of Moses, the synagogue, and the Sabbath. By these verses in Acts 15, we can understand why James in Acts 21 was compromising with Judaism (vv. 18-26). Paul realized that in the new man there cannot be any room for Jews, for Greeks, or for any natural person, yet James gave a final word which included one point that is absolutely against the principle of the new man (15:20). Paul tolerated the decision, and this toleration somewhat issued in the situation in Acts 21. By that time the Lord would not tolerate any longer. Just at the time when the Nazarite vows of Paul and four others were to be concluded, God allowed an uproar to rise up against him, and what they intended to accomplish was blown away (21:27).</p>
<p>The decision in Acts 15 was written in a way of a decree, charging all the churches to take it. Fairly speaking, I would like to have such a conference with all of those who are somewhat dissenting. We all need to have a conference in the way that Paul and Barnabas did with those in Jerusalem. Then we have to make a decision and write something to all the churches on the globe. Let all the churches keep our decree. This decree is up to the discernment of the saints according to what God says. Someone in one place did say something last year that has caused people to realize that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there are two lines today and has caused them to be very much concerned about this.</p>
<p>I said already that I do not like to cut anyone off. My ministry is to serve people, to minister Christ to people, to minister the Word to you. Many of you know how much love and patience I have been exercising over you to help you, to preserve you, and to lead you to the right way. The negative things I heard caused me to call the elders&rsquo; training in February of 1984, in September of 1985, and also caused me to call this third one. Although I feel that my toleration has to be terminated, I want to do it in the Body principle. Let us arrive at a solution and pass on the solution to all the churches on the globe.</p>
<p>It is altogether not right to have a different practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, to have different lines for the saints to go on. If there were two lines in the recovery, which line should the saints follow? If you marry one daughter to two husbands, it will be hard for the daughter to practice her human life. You may train the saints in your locality with two lines, but are you sure they will remain in your locality forever? If they go to other places, they may become a factor of trouble. The churches in the United States and Taiwan do not like to have two lines and cannot take two lines.</p>
<p>Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem and had a good conference with the brothers. Then James gave the final word. James agreed that it was not right for those Judaizers to promote their way of circumcision. That had to be terminated. In this point James was right, but in his decision he took care of Moses, the synagogue, and the Sabbath. This was a compromising, but the main factor of the trouble got solved. After this decree was passed on to the churches, Acts 16:5 says, &ldquo;So the churches were strengthened in the faith and were increasing in number daily.&rdquo; Those churches were strengthened in their faith. We should realize and see that the different kinds of practices really weakened the saints. But after such a decree the believers were strengthened in the faith. The practice of circumcision weakened the believers&rsquo; faith in Christ. They probably doubted and wondered whether circumcision or the faith in Christ were right or whether they should have faith in two things&mdash;in the law of Moses and in the salvation of Christ. After this decree the saints were strengthened.</p>
<p>Acts 15:31 tells us that when the decree was read by the church in Antioch, &ldquo;they rejoiced at the consolation.&rdquo; The saints in Antioch were bothered by this kind of different practice in the Lord&rsquo;s church. They lost their joy and were suffering so there are the two words &ldquo;rejoiced&rdquo; and &ldquo;consolation.&rdquo; I want to let the brothers who are involved in this kind of trouble relating to another line, another practice, know that some saints got bothered and troubled and were much concerned that people would wonder which line they should take. We need to make a decision as a solution to be passed on to all the churches. Let the saints be strengthened. Let them rejoice. Let them be consoled. I cannot tolerate the disease that has been spreading to weaken the Body. We need to make a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>The ones who are involved in the problems, whom I love to the uttermost, know I have done my best. The Lord is going to have a new start, and I do not want to see any different practices brought into the new start. This is why I am so strong to say that if you do not agree with the fellowship in this book, please do not copy anything of what I am doing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE&rsquo;S EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS<br />
TO BE READ BY THE LAODICEANS AND<br />
THE EPISTLE TO THE LAODICEANS TO BE READ<br />
BY THE COLOSSIANS</h2>
<p>The apostle&rsquo;s epistle to the Colossians was charged to be read by the Laodiceans, and the epistle to the Laodiceans to be read by the Colossians (Col. 4:16). The local situations and conditions of these two places might have been different in some aspects. But the apostle said that the Colossians needed to pass the epistle to them on to the Laodiceans and that the letter to the Laodiceans needed to be read by the Colossians. The Laodiceans could have said to Paul that the letter to the Colossians applied to the condition and situation in Colosse but not to their condition. They could have felt not to read Paul&rsquo;s letter to Colosse but could have been happy to receive Paul&rsquo;s letter to them. The Colossians could have said the same thing, that is, that they appreciated Paul&rsquo;s writing to them but that they did not think his writing to the Laodiceans would fit into their local situation and condition.</p>
<p>To say that we do not like to reject the ministry, but we will have to pray to see how the Lord leads us sounds very spiritual, but this is the best cloak to cover the subtle dissension. With Paul&rsquo;s charge to Colosse and Laodicea, however, there were no conditions or terms. Whatever Paul wrote was not only for a certain church or for two churches but for all the churches. We cannot tolerate anything contrary to this principle any longer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GENTILE CHURCHES BECOMING<br />
IMITATORS OF THE CHURCHES IN JUDEA</h2>
<p>The Gentile churches became imitators of the churches in Judea (1 Thes. 2:14a). To say that the church where you are should be different from the other churches is dissenting. To follow a Jewish church is not a glory in New Testament terms. It is not a glory to be Jewish, but Paul was so happy and encouraged that the church in Thessalonica took the lead to become an imitator of the churches in Judea. Suppose the churches in Brazil would imitate and follow the churches in the United States. Some may feel that this is wrong. They may feel that the churches in Brazil should remain different from the churches in the United States. In today&rsquo;s blinded situation they may think that this is spiritual. Every local church is free to take the leading of the Spirit. This sounds very good, but it is actually subtly dissenting and a real poison.</p>
<p>I must declare that in the recovery of the Lord I know what I have been doing and teaching. I do not have any regrets and I have never changed my tone. The only thing I have been practicing is toleration upon toleration and patience upon patience. From all the verses we have covered in this chapter, there is no hint left in the Bible that anyone can find to justify the erroneous teaching that the local churches could be different from one another. This teaching and practice is something subtle and does not have any base at all in the New Testament. The need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is for all the churches to be identical.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LEADING OF THE APOSTLES</h1>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>According to the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;John 14:25-26; 16:12-15; Acts 2:42; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 6:3; Col. 1:25</li>
<li>Not to practice what is beyond the Scripture&rsquo;s teaching&mdash; 1 Cor. 4:6</li>
<li>Teach what the apostle teaches&mdash;2 Tim. 2:2, 15</li>
<li>Be imitators of the apostle who is the imitator of Christ&mdash; 1 Cor. 11:1</li>
</ol>
<p>The four items in chapter four should be followed by the four items listed above. We have seen in chapter four that all the churches should be identical. There is no excuse whatsoever for a church to be different in any positive thing or in any positive way from the other churches. Any kind of difference should be condemned. I have quoted many verses to prove to you and to confirm to you that the need of all the churches to be identical is the truth according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Based upon the four points we have covered in the last chapter, no excuse can be taken for any church to be different in the positive things from any other church. We all are local churches, yet we are still the one Body of the unique Christ. A body cannot have all its members different in life, in nature, or in color. There is no ground for anyone among us, especially in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, to say that any difference in the positive things among the churches can be justified.</p>
<p>All the churches should be identical, and all the churches should follow the apostles&rsquo; leading as indicated in the four points above. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus as the Head took the lead when He was on this earth. Through the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus was the unique Leader. Peter was not the leader nor was James or John. All of them took the Lord as the Leader. He was their one Lord and they were all brothers. They did not call any others Lord; there was only one Lord among them. Even before the Lord&rsquo;s ascension they called Him Lord. Jesus Himself even told the disciples that they only have one Lord, one Master, who is the unique Leader (Matt. 23:8-10). On the evening of the day of His resurrection the Lord breathed Himself into His believers, and after His ascension He poured Himself out upon all His believers. At this point who could be the leading one among the disciples? This is a great matter for us to consider. Peter declared to the Jews on the day of Pentecost &ldquo;that God has made Him both Lord and Christ&mdash;this Jesus whom you crucified&rdquo; (Acts 2:36). Although the ascended Christ is the Lord of the believers, in practice there must be some kind of physical leading that people can see. Now that the Lord has ascended, this physical leading is not in the Lord Himself as an individual. After His ascension, this leading is now in some members of His Body who can really represent Him. These representing members, according to the New Testament, are the apostles.</p>
<p>The Greek word for apostle is <em>apostolos,</em> which simply means the one sent. An apostle is a sent one, but merely by this definition we cannot have a proper understanding of who an apostle is, especially the apostle that all the believers need to recognize as their leader. In the Acts the Lord&rsquo;s work on this earth was in two sections. The first twelve chapters form one section and the leader in this section was Peter. In the last sixteen chapters of Acts, from chapter thirteen to chapter twenty-eight, is the second section of the Lord&rsquo;s work. In this section of Acts, Paul was the leader. There were not two leaders. Barnabas and Paul traveled together and eventually Paul became the leading one. In his Epistles, Paul was so frank to tell us his standing as the leading one. The New Testament shows us that the Lord&rsquo;s move on this earth was always with two leaders&mdash;the Apostle Peter and the Apostle Paul.</p><h2 class="head1">ACCORDING TO THE TEACHING OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>The apostles that all the saints have to follow are not merely the sent ones. There were many sent ones in the New Testament. In addition to Paul and Peter there were Philip the evangelist and John. Although John went out to visit the saints in Samaria with Peter (Acts 8:14), he surely was not the leader. Barnabas, Silas, Timothy, and a number of other apostles were with Paul. But among these apostles, only Paul was the leading one. What is the factor that decides who the leading one is in a certain period of time that all the believers have to follow? According to the Bible there is only one factor&mdash;the leading one is the one who leads the Lord&rsquo;s people according to the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>The teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the teaching of the apostles. The teaching of the apostles denotes the entire revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and this entire revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is something absolutely missed by most Christians. Some believe that &ldquo;orthodox doctrine&rdquo; is only the teachings Jesus Christ gave to the twelve Apostles while He was on this earth. This is a serious mistake. If this were the case, more than half of the New Testament would be cut off. Of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, fourteen Epistles were written by Paul, who was not one among the twelve Apostles.</p>
<p>In John 16:12-15 the Lord told the disciples that He had many things to tell them that they could not bear then. The Spirit of truth would come and bring them into the realization of those things, disclosing to them whatever He had received of the Lord. All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9), and all that the Son is and has is received by the Spirit. Then the Spirit discloses all that the Triune God is and has to us, the believers (John 16:14-15). This is the divine transmission of the divine Trinity into our being. Verse 3 of Hymn 501 in our hymnal is composed according to John 16:15:</p>
<p class="hbody">All things of the Father are Thine;<br />
All Thou art in Spirit is mine;<br />
The Spirit makes Thee real to me,<br />
That Thou experienced might be.</p>
<p>What the Father has is inherited by the Son, what the Son has is passed on to the Spirit, and this very Spirit enters into our spirit to be our reality that He might become our experience. Peter and John were unable to apprehend what the Lord mentioned in John 16:12-15, so the Lord did not tell them these things in details. These few verses, however, have been developed in Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles. &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:14) is an application of the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 16:14-15.</p>
<p>The teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy includes all the teachings the Lord gave us in the four Gospels. Who understands Matthew 5&mdash;7? Who can tell you the real significance of John 14&mdash;16 with the Lord&rsquo;s concluding prayer in John 17? Today people may claim that they are the apostles but do they know these things? Many of the missionaries who went to China only told people that they were sinners and that Jesus loved them so He died for their sins on the cross. They told people that if they did not believe in Jesus they would die and go to hell, but if they did believe in Him, they would have a happy life and go to heaven. Is this God&rsquo;s New Testament economy?</p>
<p>Suppose a certain person comes to you claiming that he is a sent one, an apostle. He may preach the gospel and somewhat know the New Testament, but what kind of New Testament does he know? If he does not know God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, he will render a leading to you which is full of ignorance. A person who is ignorant of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy cannot render the proper leading to the believers. For someone to take the lead does not depend upon who he is. It depends upon whether or not he has the full knowledge of the truth concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Paul could not have rendered the believers the proper leading unless he had had the full knowledge of the mystery of the faith. In 1 Timothy 3:9 Paul even charged the deacons that they needed to hold the mystery of the faith. If you are going to be an apostle, you should be above the deacons in your knowledge of the mystery of the faith. Whether or not you are an apostle as the leader in the Lord&rsquo;s work does not depend upon who you are or upon your being sent. Thousands of missionaries have been sent to the mission field, but do you think that all of them were apostles taking the lead in the Lord&rsquo;s work? Could they render the adequate leading to the believers?</p>
<p>To some extent even Peter was not up to the standard of the full knowledge of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. When Paul was raised up by the Lord, Peter was somewhat out-of-date. This was the reason that in Peter&rsquo;s second Epistle he admitted that the one who came after him, Paul, knew much more than he did (3:16). Peter did not have as full of a realization of John 16:14-15 regarding the transmission of the divine Trinity as Paul did. Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews in particular contain the marvelous and full revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Peter and John never used the term &ldquo;the Body of Christ.&rdquo; In John&rsquo;s Gospel is the vine in chapter fifteen, which is very close to the Body of Christ. But John never used the term the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The apostles are those who can give us the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. After the day of Pentecost the believers continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles (Acts 2:42). The teaching of the apostles does not only imply the teachings of Peter and John at the time of Acts 2 because the Lord had more apostles to come. In Colossians 1:25 Paul told us that he had a particular ministry to complete the word of God. This is a great matter. If I were to stand up to tell you that I was here completing the word of God, I should be condemned to the uttermost. The word of God has been completed by Paul plus John&rsquo;s Revelation. It is at the end of John&rsquo;s Revelation that the Lord Jesus declared that no one could add anything or take away anything from what has been written. The teaching of the apostles means the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy which includes what the Lord Jesus taught in the four Gospels, what Paul wrote in his fourteen Epistles, what John wrote as the book of Revelation, and all the other books of the New Testament.</p>
<p>How many real and full Christian teachers know the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5&mdash;7? Who knows the significance of the dispensing of the divine Trinity in John 14&mdash;17? Who knows the revelation concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews? If you do not know, I would propose that you study the Life-study Messages covering them.</p>
<p>The apostles are the persons who have the adequate knowledge of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy; otherwise, they could never render any adequate, proper leadership to God&rsquo;s chosen followers. One older sister once told some younger ones that although Brother Nee was only two years older than me, I respected Brother Nee and obeyed him just like a son to a father. If I could be such an obeying person to Brother Watchman Nee, I could be such a person to everybody. But who are you for me to be a son to you?</p>
<p>T. Austin-Sparks had one of the top ministries during his time. I respected him to the uttermost and read his books more than fifty years ago. I told him personally how much help I had received from his book <em>The Release of the Lord</em> on John 12:24 and Luke 12:49-50. When he came to visit us in Taiwan he was shocked that I had received the help from this book. Although I respected him to such an extent, when he came to visit us in Taiwan the second time, I stood up to him just like Paul stood up to Peter (Gal. 2:11-14). He was undermining the church ground and trying his best to take away our practice of the church life. I rose up to stand against this because it was not according to the truth. Again, the point is this&mdash;the apostle is the one who can render you the adequate, proper leadership according to the full knowledge of the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>At the day of Pentecost Peter was qualified to tell people all the teachings the Lord Jesus gave to them while He was on this earth. Peter was qualified to do this, and his leadership was prevailing for some time. But after that his leadership began to wane (Gal. 2:11-14). Then Paul was raised up to be the prevailing leader in the Lord&rsquo;s move. In Paul&rsquo;s Epistles we can see the great mystery concerning Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32). I do not believe that Peter understood the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy to the extent that Paul did. Peter never even used the term &ldquo;the Body of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should believe that our God is living (1 Tim. 3:15). Since our God is living, He should be always moving. He is still moving today. Where is He moving? God&rsquo;s moving is always by speaking. Without speaking, He does not move. We must ask ourselves where God&rsquo;s speaking is. Is it in the Orthodox church, the Catholic church, the Protestant denominations, the state churches, the private churches, or the free groups? Our God who is living and moving always moves by speaking. We have to admit that His present speaking is among us. His present speaking is not concerning presbytery, baptism by immersion, tongue-speaking, gifts, healings, or evangelical movements. His speaking today is concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. I hope we can all be enlightened. I am forced to be bold to recommend myself so much to you all. I am forced to be a fool. The one who can be the leading one in the Lord&rsquo;s move today is the one who knows God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, the one who knows what God&rsquo;s speaking is today.</p>
<p>Peter was surely the apostle as the leader of the Lord&rsquo;s move at the day of Pentecost because he was a person who knew God&rsquo;s speaking. He was even the mouth for God&rsquo;s speaking. Whoever is the mouth for God&rsquo;s speaking in his time is the leading one. Those to whom God is speaking are the leading apostles. Whatever they minister will be the proper leading for all the saints to follow. This definition is fair.</p>
<p>To be a person who can render the proper and adequate leadership to the believers according to the full knowledge of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is not a matter of competition. No one can compete with anyone else. It all depends upon His mercy and His compassion. Paul admitted this in Romans 9:16. God gave Paul his portion in the Body of Christ and no one could compete with him.</p>
<p>If we believe in the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty and that He is living, moving, and speaking, we have to honestly, humbly, and faithfully find out where God is speaking today. Whoever has God&rsquo;s speaking concerning the entire teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are the leading ones in His move.</p>
<p>These leading ones, though, cannot add anything to the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, as revealed in the Scriptures. This teaching was altogether completed by the end of the first century through two persons&mdash;Paul and John. God&rsquo;s divine revelation as the word of God has been fully completed to the uttermost through Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles and John&rsquo;s last writing, Revelation. It was in the book of Revelation that the Lord as the unique, divine Writer declared that no one can add anything or take away anything. As a result, the Bible is the completed word of God. No one like Joseph Smith can come to tell us that he has received something in addition to the Holy Bible. Today&rsquo;s leading apostles should be the ones who only know the full contents of this divine New Testament economy. If you are going to be such a one, you must be filled with the full knowledge of the New Testament economy of God, and you also must be limited by the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. You cannot have anything else.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT TO PRACTICE WHAT IS BEYOND<br />
THE SCRIPTURE&rsquo;S TEACHING</h2>
<p>To say that there are two lines in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to go beyond the teaching of the New Testament. In the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, there are not two lines. If you stress speaking in tongues above the central line of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, you are off. To stress speaking in tongues is not according to the teaching of the New Testament economy. In the New Testament, Paul, through whom the word was completed, did his best to restrict the speaking in tongues (in 1 Corinthians 14) and never promoted it. In the entire New Testament there are no verses encouraging the promoting of speaking in tongues. If you are promoting speaking in tongues, you go beyond the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Then you will cause trouble. We must be restricted, limited, within the very realm of the unique teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Otherwise, whatever we do will cause some division. Restricting the speaking in tongues, as the Apostle Paul did, is different from opposing or stopping the speaking in tongues. We did follow the Apostle Paul to restrict the speaking in tongues, but we never opposed or stopped the proper and genuine speaking in tongues. If we did, we were beyond the teaching of the Scriptures.</p>
<p>Our preaching of the gospel of the Lord Jesus must be restricted within four things&mdash;the one accord, prayer, the Spirit, and the Word. To bring in any gimmick besides these four items is something beyond the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Temporarily what you do may seem very good and profitable, but for the long run it will produce troubles.</p>
<p>Baptism by immersion is scriptural, but to make this doctrinal point a basis upon which you build your church is beyond the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The practice of the Baptist churches went beyond this teaching and produced a great denomination with many small divisions. The Baptists themselves are divided into different groups such as the Southern Baptists and the American Baptists. Presbytery is also according to the Bible, but to make this the ground upon which you build the church is far beyond the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. For a church to set up schools or seminaries is also beyond this teaching. For the church to train the believers, however, is all right.</p>
<p>My point is that we should not bring any practice into the church life in a solid and definite way which is not in the Bible. This is something beyond the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which will sooner or later cause trouble and bring in divisions. To emphasize any spiritual gift is beyond the teaching of the New Testament economy. Gifts are in the Bible but we should not make them the emphasis of our teaching. The saints who say there are two lines in the recovery do not know how risky it is to say this.</p>
<p>Paul said that they did not do anything that was beyond what was written in the Bible (1 Cor. 4:6). The Corinthians were puffed up on behalf of one worker against the other. They said among other things that they were of Paul, which meant that they were proud and puffed up on behalf of Paul against Peter and Apollos. This is not according to the Scripture&rsquo;s teaching. Anything that goes beyond the teachings of the New Testament would damage and jeopardize a person&rsquo;s leading. The apostle&rsquo;s leading must always be according and limited to the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TEACH WHAT THE APOSTLE TEACHES</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul tells Timothy that he has to learn how to cut straight the word of the truth, how to teach the word properly. To cut straight the word means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion. He also told Timothy in 2:2 to commit to faithful men the things he had heard from Paul so that these faithful ones would be competent to teach others what Paul had been teaching. This is a charge to spread the apostle&rsquo;s teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BE IMITATORS OF THE APOSTLE<br />
WHO IS THE IMITATOR OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 11:1 Paul said, &ldquo;Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.&rdquo; If anyone does not follow Christ according to the teaching of the New Testament economy, no one among us should follow him. A leading apostle should be one who has an adequate knowledge of the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and who follows Christ accordingly. When I was young in Christianity, I was taught to follow Jesus. We have to realize, however, who Jesus is. Jesus is the Triune God who was incarnated to be a man, lived a human life on this earth, and died on the cross with seven statuses to accomplish an all-inclusive death for us. He was resurrected to be the firstborn of God and the life-giving Spirit to release the divine life to impart Himself into us. He is now the ascended One in the heavens carrying out His heavenly ministry. To be an imitator of Christ is not that simple. To imitate Christ is not to use our human effort to be humble, nice, and gentle as He was. This is a mistaken following of Christ.</p>
<p>Whoever knows, teaches, and follows Christ in His incarnation, in His human living, in His death, in His resurrection, in His ascension, and in His heavenly ministry, is the one we need to follow. If I follow this One, then you should follow me. If I am not teaching and following such a One, forget about me. It does not depend upon who I am; it only depends upon what I teach and whom I follow.</p>
<p>All the churches should be identical, and those who can render the leading to all the churches are the ones who have the adequate knowledge of the teaching of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and who would pass on these teachings to the whole earth. We follow the one who is teaching and following this all-inclusive, incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ who is still ministering in the heavenlies for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We have to follow such persons and we have to take their leading. Their leading is the proper leading for all the churches.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">NO UNCERTAIN SOUNDING<br />
OF THE TRUMPET<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S MINISTRY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:8</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S MINISTRY&mdash;<br />
THE SOUNDING OF THE TRUMPET<br />
FOR THE ARMY TO GO TO WAR</h2>
<p>In Paul&rsquo;s word to the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 14:8, he was referring to the matter of speaking in tongues with a definite interpretation. He said that if there is not a definite interpretation of a person&rsquo;s tongue-speaking, this is like sounding the trumpet with an uncertain sound. We may think an item like tongue speaking is too small for our consideration. As we have seen, another item that has been sounded is that there are two lines in the recovery. We may think that these are small things which are not related to the Lord&rsquo;s Person, to His deity, to His divinity, or to His Godhead. Speaking in tongues with or without a definite interpretation and some feeling that there are two lines in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery may be considered by some as minor things which are not related to the major items in the divine revelation. They have nothing to do with the Lord&rsquo;s headship or with the Lord&rsquo;s redemptive work. They are not something modernistic which deny the authority of the Bible or deny God&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>Some of the so-called workers, the leading ones, like to think that they can take another line, not following the one line in the ministry. They may consider this and speaking in tongues without a definite interpretation small matters which we do not need to pay attention to. To some extent I myself have had this kind of thought in the past. Although I gave such a serious word that my toleration is over, some brothers may feel, not in a negative way, but in a very positive way concerning me, that they love me and do not think that I need to be that serious about little things such as these. I had the same kind of thought in the past, but through my study I realized that in the New Testament the illustration of a trumpet being sounded to prepare others for battle is only used in 1 Corinthians. This illustration in 1 Corinthians is not used in relation to the person of Christ in His Godhead or to the crucial, eternal redemption of Christ. This illustration is used concerning a minor point, the interpretation of tongues.</p>
<p>Let us read 1 Corinthians 14:6-8 to see the context of this illustration: &ldquo;But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching? Even lifeless things, whether flute or harp, in giving a sound, if they give no distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp? For if indeed the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle? So also you, unless you give by the tongue an intelligible word, how will it be known what is being said? For you will be speaking into the air.&rdquo; It is concerning the matter of speaking in tongues, something which we consider to be so small, that the Apostle Paul inserted this verse with the word &ldquo;battle&rdquo; in it. No one among us would consider a battle a small thing. An army that is fighting a battle needs the morale, a fighting unity. In order to maintain this morale even a little dissension concerning the smallest matter has to be killed. If that little dissenting talk is not killed, the morale will be annulled. There will be no more morale, and surely the army will lose the fight, the battle. This warns me concerning the seriousness of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. The Lord&rsquo;s ministry is like the sounding of the trumpet for the army to go on to war (Num. 10:9; Judg. 7:18). The Lord&rsquo;s ministry is a matter of a battle (2 Tim. 2:3 and note 3<sup>1</sup>&mdash;Recovery Version).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S FIGHTING ARMY</h2>
<p>We have to realize that the Lord&rsquo;s church today is a fighting army. We are doing something more serious than any battle on this earth. We are fighting against God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan. The church is God&rsquo;s army, and this is fully revealed and illustrated in many aspects in Ephesians 6. Ephesians is a book on the Body of Christ, the church. It tells us that the Body of Christ, the church, is the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:22-23). It also tells us that this church is the new man created in Christ on the cross (2:15-16). Furthermore, this church is the kingdom of God, the household of the very God (2:19), and the wife of Christ, His counterpart (5:24-25). Paul eventually tells us in Ephesians that the church, the Body of Christ, with such a tremendous status, is a warrior to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy. Whatever Christ is and whatever Christ has done should be used and applied as aspects of the armor of God. We have to wear Christ as our breastplate (6:14) and as our shield (v. 16). We have to have our loins girded with Christ (v. 14), and we have to wear Christ as a pair of shoes for our standing to fight the battle (v. 15). The church is not a mere group of people collected together. The church is a universal and divine army fighting for God in the universe against His enemy.</p>
<p>In modern history there have been two world wars, but we must realize that the church today is undertaking a universal war. The space of our war is much larger than today&rsquo;s space studied by scientists. Most of their study is confined to a single galaxy, but many, many millions of galaxies and beyond form the space in which we are fighting. We are fighting the enemy in the heavenlies, in the universal space. Our battle is great beyond measure. We are not undertaking a small battle merely for the United States or for the world. Our battle is universal. In Paul&rsquo;s speaking concerning the matter of interpretation of tongues, he considered that it was related to this universal battle that we are undertaking. In his talk concerning the interpretation of tongues, he used an illustration&mdash;the sounding of a trumpet for the battle.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LACK OF INCREASE</h2>
<p>Since October of 1984 I felt greatly burdened for the Lord&rsquo;s move on this earth, and I felt very clearly that the Lord was leading me to go back to Taiwan. I was so clear that we needed to have a new start in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The recovery has been to some extent, however, polluted and marred. It has been very much weakened. An unhealthy body always is weakened. I do not think that any of us would say that in the past fifteen years the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been healthy. We all admit that it is not healthy. The fact that we have not had much increase is an evidence of this. In these fifteen years in South America, in Central America, in Africa, in Europe, and in Australasia more localities have been taken by the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but the total number in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is too small. There is no place that we can see the impact that we saw from 1949 to 1955 in Taiwan. The recovery in Taiwan at that time was like a fighting army. In many aspects and in many directions, God&rsquo;s enemy was being defeated in those years. Within those six years the increase went from about four to five hundred people up to forty or fifty thousand. The real impact was there. Now wherever the recovery has gone in the past fifteen years in South America, Central America, Europe, Australasia, and Africa, we never saw such an impact. Furthermore, the impact was weakened on the island of Taiwan, and the impact was reduced here in the United States. How about the impact? How about the morale?</p>
<p>The main factor that caused me to feel led by the Lord in October of 1984 to go back to Taiwan was the lack of the increase. It is altogether wrong to be in a condition where the rate of increase is so low. I said a strong word to the brothers from Canada in a winter training in Irving, Texas. I told them that the recovery has been existing in that country of approximately twenty-five million people, yet after more than twenty years there are only less than eight hundred saints meeting there. This is a shame and is an indicator that we have nearly no morale. In the United States there are close to one hundred churches, and the number of saints has increased at a very low rate. On the other hand, some other Christian groups, especially in the Far East, have gone up very much in number in recent years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO RECOVER THE MORALE</h2>
<p>This helped me to realize that although we are holding the proper ground, possessing many divine truths, and enjoying all the divine riches, we have lost the morale. We have become a weak person with germs. How can a person be strong with some germs affecting his body all the time. No one can deny the fact that we are weak. As a result, I am greatly burdened. I not only have to be faithful to the Lord and faithful to the churches, but I also have to be faithful to myself. I sacrificed my whole life for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I have passed through different kinds of sufferings in my ministry for the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is why I must speak the truth regardless of whom I would offend. I must do something to kill all these germs. This is the reason why I have called for three urgent elders&rsquo; trainings from 1984 through 1986.</p>
<p>When I went to Taiwan in October 1984, I revolutionized every bit of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I annulled nearly all the oldness. I do not care for intimate, natural friendship. In my whole being there is no capacity for such a thing. I have to be faithful to my Lord. I have to be faithful to so many saints who gave up their futures and came to this recovery. They came to this recovery at least ninety percent due to my ministry. If the recovery remains like this, I feel I owe much to all these dear ones who gave up their futures to come this way.</p>
<p>The Lord started something new in Taipei, and I originally had no intention to start something among the churches in the United States. Instead, I intended for the churches in the United States to wait for a time so that they could see something as a model in Taiwan. I do not want to have a start when so many old poisons remain. Because I realized that the poisons still remain in the United States, I felt burdened to call this urgent training.</p>
<p>I cannot fellowship with you at this point about these four crucial points&mdash;the home gatherings, the truth lessons, the full-time workers, and the spreading of the gospel. These are the life pulse of the Lord&rsquo;s move today. Before I can make the present situation among us clear by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I would not say a word about these four points. The army is here, but the morale has been lost. We must get the morale back before we talk about the army. With today&rsquo;s situation the way it is, it is hard to fight as an army. We can never win the battle with an uncertain sounding of the trumpet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY AND THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>Whether or not a certain church takes the ministry does not decide whether that church is a genuine local church. The title of this message does not say &ldquo;no uncertain sounding of the trumpet in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&rdquo; but &ldquo;in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry.&rdquo; I am not talking about something in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but I am talking about the ministry. The citizens of the United States may say many things to criticize the government and the commander in chief of the Armed Forces. But when you get into the army and become a soldier, you lose your right to say anything. It is possible to argue, debate, and even fight in the Senate, but even when the senators get in the army and become soldiers, they have to be quiet. There is no uncertain sounding in the army. The ministry is not like the Senate. The ministry is not a Congress for anyone to come here to express his opinion. The ministry has no capacity for that. The ministry is altogether filled up with a fighting spirit. I do not control any church. All the saints who have left the denominations, the divisive sects, and stand on the proper ground are a local church in their locality. They can express their opinions, but they may have nothing to do with this ministry.</p>
<p>Paul told us that all who were in Asia turned away from him (2 Tim. 1:15). The believers in Asia who had formerly received the apostle&rsquo;s ministry now forsook him. They did not lose their status as local churches due to the fact that they gave up Paul&rsquo;s ministry, but in fighting the battle, Paul&rsquo;s ministry could not depend upon them. For Paul&rsquo;s ministry they could not be counted on. To say that the ministry cannot depend upon a certain church does not mean that that church has been cut off from being a local church. It is still a local church, but we must realize that the ministry is a fighting unit. In this fighting unit there is no capacity and no time for your opinion.</p>
<p>I mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s interest. I have sacrificed my entire life for the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. I gave up everything to take the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Now I must be faithful to myself. Furthermore, through my ministry on this globe, thousands of saints have come into the recovery, so I must be faithful to them. Many of the saints have given up high degrees to follow the Lord in His recovery, yet it seems what they are in is tending to be disappointing. This burdens me. Some of the saints became what they are in the Lord one hundred percent due to my ministry, and I do not want my ministry to waste their time. I have to do something to insure their investment of their whole being into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. They have given up their future in the world, but they can not have much encouragement in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I have to be faithful to the Lord, faithful to so many of you who have been very much affected by this ministry, and faithful to myself. For this reason, this ministry cannot allow anyone to pretend to be in it and yet still say something different. This does not mean that I ask you to stay away from your local church or that your local church is no longer a local church. What I am fellowshipping about is the impact of the ministry for the fighting of the Lord&rsquo;s interest in His recovery.</p>
<p>Whatever I would say concerning the home gatherings, the full-timers, the truth lessons, and the spreading of the gospel is not for anyone who does not feel good about my ministry, who is dissenting to my ministry, who is pretending to be here under the ministry yet actually is not. I still love all the dear saints who may fall into this category and still count them as brothers in Christ, but we need to have an army full of impact, and this army has no capacity and no time for anyone to express any kind of opinion. We are fighting a battle. The army began the fighting already in Taiwan. Now we want to see this army increasing to fight the battle not only in the United States but also in Canada, in Central America, in South America, in Europe, in Africa, in Australasia, and in the entire continent of Asia. This is what I want to see. I am not talking about the churches, I am talking about the ministry. The ministry is one thing, and the churches are another thing. These two things can be differentiated in the Epistles written by Paul. Paul&rsquo;s ministry is one category, and the churches are another category. Paul never tried to force all the churches to follow him in his ministry, but Paul surely had a ministry for the churches.</p><h2 class="head1">GOING TO FIGHT THE BATTLE<br />
IN A DESPERATE WAY WITH NO OPINION</h2>
<p>Some saints came to me a number of times with reports concerning serious and even negative situations. They may have misunderstood my not responding to them with any kind of seriousness. I believe I did not respond in this way not only out of my patience and toleration but also because of the Lord&rsquo;s wisdom. I feel that it is altogether wise to be patient. When the fruit of a particular tree is growing, the fruit itself will show what it is. When the fruit becomes ripe, it will fall from the tree. At this point, however, I do not feel that I should tolerate certain situations any longer because enough damage has been done already. I do not like to see more damage done to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I have no time, dear saints, to fool around with people any longer. Let us go to fight the battle. Who are the &ldquo;us&rdquo;? The ones who are desperate with no opinion.</p>
<p>In the eighteen years that I was involved in the work on mainland China, I did a lot but no one ever heard any opinion from me. They only heard my voice in giving messages all according to Brother Nee. Some brothers can testify that among all the co-workers with Brother Nee in those eighteen years I did the most. But I labored without voicing any opinion. In the co-workers&rsquo; conferences sometimes Brother Nee would ask, &ldquo;Witness, what would you say?&rdquo; I had nothing to say. My attitude was that whatever Brother Nee told me to do, I would do it. It was that simple. From 1932 to 1950 no one ever heard me expressing any opinion regarding the work in mainland China.</p>
<p>Actually, there is nearly nothing different between my understanding and Brother Nee&rsquo;s except for one thing. I never told anyone what this was, not even my wife or family, until I came to this country and Brother Nee went to be with the Lord. The doctrinal item which I felt different from Brother Nee was regarding the two witnesses in the book of Revelation (11:3-12). This was the only difference between my understanding and Brother Nee&rsquo;s. My intention is to show you that I was not altogether the same in everything with Brother Nee. In this one thing I was not the same and I am still not the same. My point is this&mdash;in spite of this difference, I never uttered anything in my ministry that Brother Nee did not preach, and I did not teach anything that he had not touched.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE FLOW</h2>
<p>The Lord has opened my eyes to realize as I have told you in the past, that in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, there is only one current flowing from the throne (Rev. 22:1). At Pentecost the current began to flow out of Jerusalem through Judea, through Samaria, and went up to Antioch. There the flow turned to Asia Minor, to eastern Europe, to Rome, and probably even to Spain, which by that time was considered as the uttermost part of the earth. There was only one flow. You cannot see two flows in the book of Acts.</p>
<p>Barnabas was an excellent brother who actually brought Saul of Tarsus into his ministry (Acts 11:25-26). At the beginning Barnabas took the lead. On the way of their first journey, however, the Spirit records that Paul began to take the lead, and the Spirit began to refer to Saul as Paul (Acts 13:9). The change of name may indicate the change in life. From this point on Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, took the lead in the apostolic ministry all the way, and Barnabas accepted that. Barnabas was one with Paul to go to Jerusalem to get the solution regarding the trouble of circumcision. Right after that solution was made as a decree to all the churches, there was a contention between Barnabas and Saul (Acts 15:35-39). This contention was not about something great but about something small. They did not separate from each other because of a different opinion concerning the faith or concerning the headship of Christ. The split between them was concerning a small, personal, intimate thing. Barnabas wanted to take his cousin Mark along with him on their journey and Paul said no. To us that is a small thing, but after Barnabas left Paul with Mark there is no more record of him in the Lord&rsquo;s move in the book of Acts. The reason for this is because the Lord would only care for one flow.</p>
<p>I saw this matter clearly in 1933 when Brother Nee asked me to join him in the work in Shanghai. At that time I was doing a work in north China that was quite prevailing and even promising to me in teaching the Bible. Because my eyes were opened, I told the Lord that I would go to Shanghai to join Brother Nee and the work. I realized that the Lord&rsquo;s flow, the Lord&rsquo;s current, on this earth has been only one. If north China were to be taken by the Lord, He would surely do it through the same flow. I had to jump into this current, to be one with this current to let the Lord flow.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LEADERSHIP IN THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE</h2>
<p>Now let us consider Apollos. There is not a long record of Apollos in the Bible. He was not dissenting, but he somewhat remained in another flow (1 Cor. 16:12). There is no hint that Apollos intended to carry on another flow, but whatever he was and whatever he did gave people a different impression. This is why after he worked in Corinth some could say that they were of Apollos (1 Cor. 3:4), and some were puffed up on behalf of Apollos against Paul (4:6). Apollos was not wise. If he had been wise, he would have never behaved in that way.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I can declare that in those eighteen years when I was involved in the work on mainland China, I was wise. I never caused anyone to think that they could be puffed up on behalf of me against Brother Nee. There was no such thing. Whatever the saints saw of me, my behavior, my way of living, my actions, the way I worked, my messages, and my speaking, they all considered to be absolutely one with Brother Watchman Nee. I did not leave any loopholes for anyone to think that I was different from Brother Nee. I believe that was the Lord&rsquo;s wisdom through His mercy given to me. Our history since that time speaks a great deal. Among so many co-workers of Brother Nee, where is the recovery? I did not have any kind of thought to be the one to carry on the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Even when I went to Taiwan, I was definitely sent. That was Brother Nee&rsquo;s proposal to the co-workers. I never had the thinking or the feeling that I was going to be the leader. Even when I came to the United States, I did not have the thought of being the leader in the western world of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. But where is the recovery today and under what kind of leadership? Some of the so-called co-workers claim that they were so close to Watchman Nee, but nearly not one church has ever been raised up by any of them.</p>
<p>It is altogether not wise for you to remain in the recovery taking this ministry on the one hand, and yet on the other hand to say something else. This is not wise. It is not profitable to yourself or to your future. You may say you have a ministry, but this is not profitable to your ministry if you have one. You can never profit your ministry in the future in this way. Rather, you have dispensed your future in a cheap way. The wise way is to stay, without any opinion, with the recovery which is unique.</p>
<p>I want to be faithful and frank, and I want to make the situation clear to all of you. I do not believe that my being here is altogether of myself. Rather, I believe that my being here is of the Lord. I want to see many of you rise up to be able to do the same thing that I am doing. I would never be jealous. I like to see this and I am for this!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ARMY<br />
AND THE CITIZENS</h2>
<p>Now you understand my standing, my heart, and where I am. Brothers, we need to be wise. We are an army formed by His mercy and grace to fight the battle for the kingdom of the heavens! The island of Taiwan has to be evangelized and truthized by this army within the next four years. For the fulfilling of this purpose, I would not tolerate any kind of dissenting thought. To be a citizen of the United States is one thing, but to fight in the United States Army is another matter. When Gideon was called to take the army to fight the battle for Jehovah, the Lord told him that he had too many (Judg. 7:4). Eventually, the Lord chose three hundred men and told Gideon to send the others home. This does not mean that whoever went back home was no longer an Israelite. He was still an Israelite, but he had nothing to do with the fighting army.</p>
<p>You may be a member of a local church and yet have nothing to do with the ministry to fight the battle for the Lord&rsquo;s interest on this earth. All of you are the elders, the co-workers, and the apprentice elders, the leading ones, in the recovery. I am speaking to you all as the soldiers in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, not to the citizens. I am speaking to the soldiers of the army. Are you going to remain in the army? You have to realize what the army is and what the army would do. The army has no capacity to take your opinion. There is no time for the army to fool around. The situation is quite urgent. The intention of this heavenly army is to evangelize and truthize Taiwan first and then the United States.</p>
<p>One brother recently asked me if I could come to his part of the world to labor in a conference. His fellowship with me gave me the feeling that he is not fighting with us. My burden is to take Taiwan first and then the United States second. I do not care for any particular region on this earth. I am for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and I have the view to make this strategy. To my observation the best strategy is to take Taiwan first. If you are only for your part of the world this may disappoint you, but if you are for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery you&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; You may even have the burden to send some soldiers to join the army to evangelize Taiwan!</p><h2 class="head1">BE WISE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEADER<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE</h2>
<p>It is clear in the New Testament that Paul was taking the lead in the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament ministry on the earth at that time. When I was working with Brother Nee in mainland China, I never considered myself as anything. I only considered myself as a co-worker to carry out Brother Nee&rsquo;s burden. I did my best not to preach any gospel not preached by him and not to give any message never given by him. I did my best not to use any terminology or eloquence for the preaching, the speaking, the teaching, which he never used. I must declare and praise the Lord that I have received the blessing. I never regret what I did. No one ever heard one thing out of my mouth concerning Brother Nee in a negative way. I am still so grateful to him. Without him, without his ministry, I could never be here like I am. I only labored, I only worked, and I never caused any problem to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Just before the government in mainland China was about to be changed to Communism, Brother Nee proposed an urgent conference of the leading co-workers in Shanghai. He fellowshipped with us concerning how we were going to face the coming situation. He proposed to send me out of mainland China to go abroad, and he said that he and the others would sacrifice themselves in mainland China for the Lord&rsquo;s purpose. I did not feel good about this. It seemed to me that I was a dropout and that everyone would stay but me. After the meeting, Brother Nee and I took a walk, and I asked him why it was that all the brothers would stay to sacrifice themselves for the Lord&rsquo;s work, yet I would be asked to go out. I could never forget the look on Brother Nee&rsquo;s face when he turned to look at me. He told me that we should be desperate and even willing to sacrifice ourselves for the Lord&rsquo;s move and that he realized there was much possibility that one day the enemy would wipe us out. He told me that in case we were wiped out, I had to go out so that we would still have something left. Then I said that I would take his word and go. Out of the many co-workers, I was the only one designated by him to go out in case we would be wiped out, so that we would still have something left. Whatever Brother Nee said was all fulfilled and has become history. Praise Him&mdash;we still have something left.</p>
<p>We brothers must realize that we are not doing any work of ourselves. You are not doing your work and neither am I doing my work. We are all doing a unique work for the Lord&rsquo;s unique recovery. There are over six hundred churches on this globe and not one is &ldquo;in my pocket.&rdquo; The leading ones in Anaheim can testify that I do not even know their meeting schedule. If I want to attend the Lord&rsquo;s table I need to make a phone call to find out where I should go. Whatever churches I have built up have all gone &ldquo;into others&rsquo; pockets.&rdquo; We should realize that we are not doing a work for ourselves. We are doing a work for His recovery. Regardless of how much people have criticized Brother Nee, he was more than faithful to what he had seen. He surely worked for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and he has made a good, proper, and adequate foundation for this recovery. I am continuing to build up the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and I am doing the same work. I hope that all of you would be clear about this. Do not think about being somebody. We all are nobody! Only Christ has a Body.</p>
<p>I do feel that my frank word should make the entire situation clear to all of you and make the need clear to all of you. We need a fighting army and in the fighting army we do not merely need a leader. We need a commander to fight the battle! We do not have any time to waste. Many of you who have given up high degrees and high positions for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have to be faithful to your sacrifice. You also have to be faithful to so many who were influenced by you; otherwise, you are cheating them. We must be faithful to our Lord. We are serving Him and we mean business. We are not just doing a job to feed ourselves, to make a living. That is shameful. If you want to make a living, do not stay in the Lord&rsquo;s work. Go to another and better field for you to make a better living. We must mean business with the Lord, with the saints, and with ourselves. This is the only way for us to go on in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. Now you know where I am and where you should be. Also, you know what all of us should do&mdash;go to fight as an army and in the army.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">A WISE MASTER BUILDER<br />
AND THE BUILDING OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:3-23</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A MATTER OF LIFE AND THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>After fellowshipping in the last chapter concerning the uncertain sounding of the trumpet in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry, which refers to the army fighting the battle, I would like to fellowship in this chapter concerning the wise master builder and the building of God. The fellowship in this chapter is different in nature from that of the last chapter. When we go to the front to fight the battle, we have to be bold. Then we can win the war. But when we come to build, we have to be wise. We have to realize that the building which we are building is altogether a matter in life. The twenty-one verses of the Scripture reading show us that the wise master builder and the building of God are both matters of life and in life. First, Paul&rsquo;s ministry was a matter of planting. Paul said, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow&rdquo; (3:6). This is not a matter of fighting, but a matter of the growth in life. Then Paul goes on to say that we are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, God&rsquo;s farm (3:9). This farm is not wild or uncultivated, but it is a farm cultivated by God to grow Christ. A farm is also a matter of life. Then Paul says that we are not only God&rsquo;s farm but also God&rsquo;s building (3:9). This building surely is a building in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING HEED HOW WE BUILD</h2>
<p>Paul continues to tell the Corinthians that he has laid the foundation as a wise master builder, and the rest of the believers, whether they are co-workers like Apollos or believers in the church, are all workers, builders. Each one is a builder, yet you have to be careful, to take heed, with what you build and how you build. If you build with the transformed precious materials&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;you will receive a reward. If you build with other categories of material&mdash;wood, grass, and stubble&mdash;that will be burnt and you will lose your reward. You will still be saved, yet saved as through fire (3:15). To be saved through fire indicates clearly that you will be saved through a certain amount of discipline. To be saved through fire is to be saved through a certain kind of burning purification, a certain kind of purging. This is a suffering, a discipline, and a kind of punishment. Those who build with the wrong material will be saved through punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF THE TEMPLE OF GOD</h2>
<p>Paul continues to say that we need to realize that we are the temple of God (v. 16). Apparently, these verses are not in a good continuation. Although it may appear that each of these verses stands alone, in the apostle&rsquo;s thought when he wrote this chapter, all these items are connected with one another. On the one hand, we are the workers who are working on God&rsquo;s building. On the other hand, we ourselves are the building, the temple. It is not merely a matter of how we build, but we also need to realize how we treat this temple. If you deal with the temple of God carefully, you will not destroy it. If you deal with it carelessly, He will destroy you. First Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him.&rdquo; This is not to perish forever, but to experience God&rsquo;s dealing, God&rsquo;s punishment.</p>
<p>According to my understanding of the holy Word, to be saved through fire will surely be in the future, but for God to destroy the one who destroys His temple is surely in this age. In this age, the one who destroys the temple of God will suffer God&rsquo;s destruction. This is similar to what Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 11. If we eat the bread and drink the cup at the Lord&rsquo;s table in an unworthy manner, we eat and drink judgment to ourselves. Paul goes on to say that this is why &ldquo;many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep&rdquo; (v. 30). The Lord firstly disciplined the ones who participated in His table in an unworthy manner so that they were weak physically. Then, since they would not repent of their offense, they were further disciplined to be sick. Because they still would not repent, the Lord judged them by death. This death is not a curse, but a destruction, because of a person ruining or destroying the temple of God. To partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table in an improper manner is to destroy the temple because the Body that we partake of at the Lord&rsquo;s table signifies God&rsquo;s building. The Body in chapter eleven is the temple in chapter three.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 3 is a chapter full of seriousness. The church as the temple of God is also God&rsquo;s farm and God&rsquo;s building. God&rsquo;s farm, God&rsquo;s building, is altogether a matter of life plus transformation. We all have to be very serious concerning ourselves. We have to grow in life. We have to learn how to build and with what to build. The way you build must be the way in life, and the materials with which you build have to be the substances of life plus transformation. Our future destiny for at least one thousand years depends upon how we grow and how we take care of God&rsquo;s unique building in this universe, His temple. You have to be careful not to do anything to destroy this temple. If you destroy this temple, the church, God will deal with you, God will destroy you. When you come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, you touch the Lord&rsquo;s Body, the mystical Body of Christ, which is the temple of God. If you touch the Lord&rsquo;s Body carelessly; you will damage it, and to damage the Body is to destroy the temple. If you destroy the temple, God will destroy you.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 11 the way God disciplines us is firstly to give us an alarm. Whenever we get sick, we should not take it for granted. Do not think that your getting the flu is merely a physical matter due to the fact that everyone is getting it. Some people did not get the flu, so why are you among the number who did get it? There should be a reason. Whatever happens to us, we have to believe that it is sovereign of the Lord. Even a small case of the flu that comes to us may mean something. We have to consider in this way. If you have a small case of the flu, this should cause you to go to the Lord to have a full exam. Do not only go to the doctor to have a test of your blood, of your blood pressure, or of your heart. You had better spend more time to be tested by the Lord. Let the Lord speak a word to you. Take your sickness as a warning. I assure you that you will surely be healed. Do not excuse your illness as a mere natural occurrence. Whatever happens to us must remind us that we should go to Him to be enlightened, to be exposed, to be tested, to be examined. We have to receive the Lord&rsquo;s warning; otherwise, death will come. Death surely is not a curse to us because we have been saved from the curse already. Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law (Gal. 3:13). But the New Testament does not say that we will not be disciplined.</p><h2 class="head1">DISCIPLINE IN THE AGE TO COME</h2>
<p>The Brethren opposed the truth concerning the discipline of the coming age. But when I was with them, they always warned us to be careful in our Christian conduct; otherwise, God would discipline or chastise us. They taught strongly concerning God&rsquo;s chastisement of the believers in this age. Later I was enlightened to see that God&rsquo;s chastisement is not only in this age but even more in the coming age. The Lord Jesus told us clearly in Matthew 24 and 25 that if the servants are slothful, He will punish them when He returns. Matthew 24:51 tells us that when the Lord comes He shall cut the unfaithful and evil slave asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. To cut asunder does not mean to cut into pieces but to cut off. Because we believers have always been attached to Christ, the anointed One, we are one with Him. If we are unfaithful, at the judgment seat of Christ, the Lord will make the decision to cut us off from this attachment with Him. To cut the evil slave asunder is to cut him off from Christ and to put him into the outer darkness (Matt. 25:30) where he Will suffer the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. This will take place after the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>The coming age of the millennium is still a period of time of the old creation. Although the millennium will be a time of restoration, it will still be in the old creation since the new heaven and the new earth will have not yet been realized. God&rsquo;s dealing with His people and with mankind will not be completely finished in this age of grace. His dealing with His believers will continue in the next age. This age and the coming age are both parts of the age of the old creation. God needs another age, the age of the kingdom, to discipline the immature believers and to prepare the Israelites who are saved at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Since their being saved was after the age of grace, they still need a period of time for God to perfect them. Furthermore, God needs to perfect some of the nations to be transferred into the new earth to be the people on the new earth for eternity. Through the time of the millennium, God will prepare or perfect these three kinds of people for His new universe. This is a clear view concerning the matter of the dispensations. The Brethren are famous as dispensational teachers, yet they did not see clearly the details concerning the age of grace and the age of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WISE MASTER BUILDER</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we are an army, and with the army there should be a commander in chief. In the New Testament you cannot find the term &ldquo;commander in chief.&rdquo; We can realize this matter, though, by inference from Paul&rsquo;s mentioning of the uncertain sound of the trumpet for the battle (1 Cor. 14:8). Surely the battle implies an army, and in an army there is the need of a general to command the army, to direct the army to fight. On the other hand, in 1 Corinthians 3:10 Paul says that he is a &ldquo;master builder.&rdquo; In Greek the word for master builder is <em>architekton.</em> The English word &ldquo;architect&rdquo; is the anglicized form of this word. An architect is one who designs the building and superintends its construction. In chapter five we saw who the apostles are, but not all the apostles are master builders. With a building, there cannot be two master builders. That would bring in confusion. A master builder may have a helper, though. Likewise, in an army there cannot be two commanders in chief. A commander in chief may have someone who is second in command, but he is the one in charge of all the troops. Not all the apostles are wise master builders. Paul said that according to the grace of God given to him, he was a wise master builder (3:10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Planter</h2>
<p>On the one hand, Paul was very bold toward the Corinthians in dealing with divisions in the first four chapters. On the other hand, he was very humble in his speaking. He did not show or give the impression that he was superior to Cephas and to Apollos. Rather, he ranked himself among them. But regardless of how humble he was in writing this portion of the Word, when he came to chapter three he admitted that he was the planter (v. 6). The planter is much more crucial than the waterer (Apollos). A plant may not need a waterer for a certain length of time, but without a planter there is no plant. Paul was humble, but he would not give up the real facts and he had to speak them. Between Paul and Apollos who was more crucial? Apollos could have been spared. To have Apollos is good, but not to have Apollos is not a great loss. Apollos was not a planter but just a waterer. He did not have the stuff of life, the substance of life. He had some knowledge of the Bible to water the saints, but the planter was Paul.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Father</h2>
<p>The shallow, superficial, and even blind Corinthians appreciated the Bible teachings of Apollos and puffed themselves up on behalf of Apollos against Paul (4:6). This shows the stupidity of the Corinthians. They forgot through whom they were born. Paul told them, &ldquo;For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:15). This verse implies that Apollos was one of these ten thousand guides or teachers. I would like to say the same thing to all the churches that have been raised up by this ministry&mdash;you may have ten thousand guides or teachers, but not one is your father. All the teachers are expendable, but not your father. Although Paul was humble, he was also frank and bold. He would never ignore the facts. It was a fact that he begat all the Corinthian believers. He was the father and the planter, not Apollos nor even Peter. Based upon these facts, Paul declared that by the Lord&rsquo;s grace he was a wise master builder, a wise architect. An architect does not control the workers or manage the work. First, he designs. Second, he superintends the construction. This was exactly what Paul did.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING YOURSELF AND KNOWING OTHERS</h2>
<p>I want to get into all these points contained in this book to make the truth so bright in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the heavens should not be closed. The heavens have to be open to us; the sky should not be cloudy but clear. Do not think that I am fighting against anyone or blaming anyone. My burden is to make God&rsquo;s New Testament economy clear. Like Paul, I can never deny that the Lord has shown me something. A wise master builder is an architect who designs the building, and after designing he superintends and oversees the construction work.</p>
<p>I have the full assurance to say that among the elders and the co-workers there has been the ambition to be above others, to take the lead, and to have another line. It is very good if you can take the lead, but you have to ask yourself if you have that portion of grace. For years you have been doing your work with the materials from this ministry. I never said anything negative against anyone, but I have been watching over your writings. I would like to see that the Lord has really raised up more brothers. I would be happy. Actually, though, in whatever you minister, in whatever you wrote, there is nothing new in any point. Every point is a kind of copy of an existing point in the ministry. You just would not say that is something quoted from the ministry. You want to give people your kind of color so that they think that is your kind of teaching with the pretense that people will not be able to understand Brother Lee&rsquo;s word. You have to consider what your position is in the Lord&rsquo;s move. You may not have the portion to do what you are doing.</p>
<p>While I was involved in the work on mainland China for eighteen years, I recognized and admitted that I did not have the portion to take the lead there. I recognized, respected and regarded Brother Nee as the unique master builder. I had no idea or opinion concerning the way the Lord&rsquo;s recovery needed to take. The design came from Brother Nee. He was the superintendent, not I, so I had no right and no position to express any kind of opinion. My position and my right, thank the Lord, was just to take Brother Nee&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<p>During those eighteen years on mainland China, Brother Nee had a number of conferences for the co-workers. Sometimes Brother Nee said, &ldquo;Witness, what would you say?&rdquo; I had nothing to say and I had no opinion because I was just waiting to take the word from Brother Nee. I was learning under him, and I watched to see how the co-workers responded to him. I learned a great deal. Young brothers&mdash;this is wise. If you watch how others respond to the leading one and listen, you are wise. You will not say a word because you do not have the position to give any opinion. The steering wheel is not in your hand. For you to give your opinion concerning what direction the car should take causes trouble, bothers people, and makes people unhappy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING AMBITIOUS</h2>
<p>It is stupid to be ambitious. All the ambitious ones in the past twenty-three years of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States were finished and even terminated by their ambition. We all need to condemn ambition. If you can design the proper, unique design for God&rsquo;s building and if you can superintend the construction to point out all the needs of the building, you do not need to qualify or enthrone yourself. What you are and what you can do will enthrone you. Who are the apostles? Who are the leaders? This does not depend upon a person&rsquo;s ambition, intention, proclamation, or claim. That does not work. It depends upon the facts. Do you have the ability to design God&rsquo;s building according to His New Testament economy? You may be far off. Thank God that you may know how to preach the gospel. Thank God that you may know how to water the saints by teaching the Bible. You should be satisfied with that portion. You have to be contented with the portion the Lord has given you with thanksgivings, realizing that you can only do that much.</p>
<p>You do not have any idea or view concerning the design of the building of God. Do you have the ability to watch over, to oversee, the entire work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery concerning His New Testament economy? To do this is not merely a matter of a general leading an army and giving commands to go and fight. It is a greater thing to be able to design God&rsquo;s unique building in the universe. The New Testament ministry is a matter in life, not just a battle, a fighting. The church is God&rsquo;s farm full of the growth in life that produces the transformed materials which constitute the construction of God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace He has shown me these things. To some extent, I have been forced to talk this way. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery means something. Both Brother Nee and I had the boldness to share these things with others because we cannot deny that we have seen something. We have studied not only the Bible but also Christianity. We studied the Brethren and we know who they are. Even they themselves do not know that much about themselves. We do not have any degree, so we dare not say that we are the learned doctors. We are like Jesus the Nazarene. Thank Him that we have seen something which we cannot deny.</p>
<p>I have been forced to present the real situation to you. I love you and I am trying my best to rescue you from a vague situation. In that kind of vague situation, you may be ambitious to be something. I beg you not to do this. If you have really been gifted with a certain capacity, you do not need to be ambitious. You do not need to consider that you are such a person. This is all vanity. It all depends upon how much the Lord has measured to you, what the portion is that the Lord has given to you. Be faithful to that portion and you will get a reward.</p><h2 class="head1">GROWING IN LIFE, BEING TRANSFORMED<br />
INTO PRECIOUS MATERIAL FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING,<br />
AND BEING CAREFUL NOT TO DAMAGE OR DESTROY<br />
CHRIST&rsquo;S BODY, GOD&rsquo;S TEMPLE</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 3 shows us what life is. First; we all have to realize that we are plants; you are a plant and I am a plant. Let us forget about things such as service, work, eldership, and apostleship. I want to remember that I am a little plant. As a little plant in life, I need to grow, and to grow I need water. I will take water from whoever can water me. Then I will grow. Furthermore, I want to be transformed into precious material for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stone. The first basic thing we have to learn is the matter of the growth in life. As a plant I am growing in the soil with all the riches. My soil is the processed and consummated Triune God. I want to dwell in Him and be rooted down in Him to absorb all His riches through my contacting Him. I like to contact Him, absorb Him, dwell in Him, be rooted in Him, and grow in Him to enjoy all His riches. Then I will grow into transformation to become precious material for His unique building in this universe.</p>
<p>While I am growing, He will lead me to participate in the divine work. What a privilege that I can be participating in God&rsquo;s divine work! Then I work in this divine building, not by my natural ability, not by wood, grass, or stubble. These categories of material are natural and worldly, having nothing to do with growth, life, and transformation. I would never work with this kind of material. I should deny myself, put my soul life aside, and condemn my natural ability. I build with what I grow with. I build with my growth, with my enjoyment of the Triune God. This is what it means to build with gold, silver, and precious stones.</p>
<p>I am also careful not to damage or destroy Christ&rsquo;s Body; otherwise, I will suffer destruction because the church, Christ&rsquo;s Body and God&rsquo;s temple, is a treasure so dear and precious to Him, purchased with His own blood (Acts 20:28). If I destroy the temple, God will destroy me. I do not want to be a Christian like the Corinthians. They did not take care of the growth in life. Paul said that they were still babes, behaving, acting, and touching the church affairs altogether in the flesh (1 Cor. 3:1-3). Because they were fleshly and even fleshy, Paul could not give them solid food. He could only feed them with milk.</p>
<p>The Corinthians were puffed up on behalf of Apollos against Paul and on behalf of Paul against Cephas (1 Cor. 4:6). This is all in the flesh and is to build the church with wood, grass, and stubble. To criticize or condemn others carelessly is to destroy the temple, not discerning the Body, and will cause one to suffer loss. Most Christians today are suffering loss. Many are under a kind of destruction. Years ago I warned the saints, but the opposers twisted my word to say that I am cursing and threatening people. Actually, my warning was a word in love. We have to realize that it is not a small thing to touch the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE QUALIFICATIONS OF AN ARCHITECT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 3 is a chapter not on fighting but on growing. To be a planter like the Apostle Paul and to be a plant, you need some life. As a plant you need to grow, and through growth you will have transformation to become the precious material for God&rsquo;s building. You then will do the right work with what you grow and with what you have been transformed, building with gold, silver, and precious stones for the building of God. You would never use anything of your natural life or worldly ability&mdash;wood, grass, or stubble&mdash;to build the church. Nor would you touch the Body, the church of Christ, the temple of God, carelessly to suffer destruction spiritually, soulishly, or physically.</p>
<p>If you were such a person, the Lord would probably assign a portion to you that you might be qualified and able to be a designer because you know His concepts, His heart&rsquo;s desire, His eternal purpose, His eternal plan, His good pleasure. You also know His economy, the Old Testament economy and the New Testament economy, the eternal economy. Since you know all these things, this qualifies you to be a designer, an architect, a wise master builder. Because you know what you design, you also know how to superintend the construction.</p>
<p>An architect does not control the workers. His controlling would keep them away from their work. Nobody could work under another&rsquo;s control; they may even go on strike. An architect does not exercise control, but his view of the construction. Based upon this view, he renders much helpful, positive, and constructive instructions. He helps by adjusting and sometimes by giving a warning. The master builder is not the controller but the one who has the design and the one who oversees, superintends, the construction work in detail.</p>
<p>Paul exercised much of his superintending ability in writing 1 Corinthians. In this one Epistle Paul dealt with eleven problems among the believers in Corinth; some of these problems were concerning division, fornication, bringing brothers to the law, and marriage. Could you have such an all-inclusive view to write an Epistle to such a complicated and complicating church? Maybe all that you would be able to tell them would be to contact the Lord and pray often. You might even tell them to fast and pray and to love one another. Your fellowship may sound very good. You may be very spiritual, loving, kind, and nice, but I do not think that someone &ldquo;who is building a house would hire you as an architect.&rdquo; You might be qualified to be a pastor in a small denomination.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRAINED FOLLOWERS WHO ARE<br />
GROWING IN LIFE TO BE TRANSFORMED<br />
INTO PRECIOUS MATERIAL FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING,<br />
WHO WOULD NOT SAY OR DO ANYTHING<br />
TO DESTROY GOD&rsquo;S TEMPLE, AND<br />
WHO SEE THE VISION OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>I am trying my best to present to you what the Lord has shown me. By presenting these things to you in such a way, I hope you can see the great difference between the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and Christianity. There is no comparison. Such fellowship concerning the deeper truths of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy may cause some to be angry with me. This has been my suffering.</p>
<p>Some of you may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we will follow you and go to fight.&rdquo; How will you go to fight? Even the soldiers in today&rsquo;s United States Army need to be trained. You need to be trained in your character. Get rid of your looseness and inaccuracy in doing things. You cannot be a wild soldier. We must be so fine in being dealt with by the Lord to grow in life. We should have the attitude that we do not like to be anybody. We only like to grow to be transformed into precious material for God&rsquo;s building. We should be altogether careful not to do or say anything to damage or destroy any part of God&rsquo;s temple, which is the very dear Body of the Head, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>With this building work there must be an architect who gives us the proper design. To lay the foundation is to give the design. These two things are one. Then the architect tells us, charges us, and warns us to be careful how to build and with what we build. This is his superintending of the construction. The architect, the wise master builder, gives us the design, which is to lay the foundation. No one can give you another design, another foundation, which is the all-inclusive Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit as the very embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God. This foundation is the very contents of our belief, the very contents of the New Testament economy of God. The architect laid this foundation by such a design. After giving such a design, after laying such a foundation, he is now superintending to see how the building is going on. We need such a view in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I believe this vision will control us, restrict us, and preserve us from being wild. &ldquo;Where there is no vision, the people run wild&rdquo; (Prov. 29:18&mdash;Heb.).</p>
<p>You may say that you follow Brother Lee, that you are one with this ministry. This sounds very good, but I am a little concerned that you may not know what it means to be one with the ministry. You may want to take me as your commander in chief and follow me, but I do not want to have many followers who know nothing about God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We are not doing anything but carrying out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Christianity has delayed the Lord and missed the mark for centuries, but in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the one thing, the unique thing, the Lord has been showing us is the New Testament economy of God. I hate that you would not see this. Because of your not seeing, some of you have been ambitious to be something and have tried to have another line in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The seeing of the vision preserves you. The seeing will be the white line for your driving. What I have presented to you in this chapter is the white line for your driving to save and preserve you.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">ONE ACCORD IN THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:32; Rom. 15:5-6; 1 Cor. 1:10; Phil. 1:27; 2:2; 4:2; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 6:3; 2 Tim. 1:15; Rev. 1:4-5a</h1>
<p>The one accord is the base, the ground, for our present practice in the Lord&rsquo;s move. Anything that we do, teach, or practice must be absolutely according to the holy Word, which is God&rsquo;s completed revelation. The very great, particular characteristic in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to do everything according to the Bible. The matter of being in one accord in the New Testament occupies a very crucial stand for the Lord&rsquo;s move.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT AND<br />
THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>Many Christians have seen that in the Lord&rsquo;s move the biggest factor is the Holy Spirit. The Spirit, who is the biggest factor in the Lord&rsquo;s move in the New Testament today, after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, is the consummated Spirit, the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. The Spirit poured out from the heavens upon the believers in Acts was not merely the Spirit of God as He was in Genesis 1:2 or merely the Holy Spirit as He was in Matthew 1:18 and 20. In Genesis 1:2 the Spirit of God brooded over the condemned and judged earth. Through His brooding the creation in God&rsquo;s plan was brought in. In the Old Testament the Spirit was very much involved with God&rsquo;s old creation.</p>
<p>In the New Testament is the Holy Spirit. In Matthew 1 this Holy Spirit got involved with something deeper. The Holy Spirit was involved, not in the outward, objective creation but in the inward, subjective incarnation. This incarnation is the Triune God conceived in a human being, and the very element to carry this out was the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was not only the means to carry out the incarnation but also the element and essence. To have any conception there is the need of two basic elements with two basic essences. Without these two essences, no conception could be carried out. To carry out the divine conception of Jesus there was the need of two essences&mdash;the divine essence and the human essence. The divine essence was the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, who was God incarnate, lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years and died on the cross to accomplish a full and eternal redemption by dying an all-inclusive death with seven statuses. Then He passed through the tomb and descended into Hades (Acts 2:27). He was resurrected out of death and Hades, and in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). On the day of His resurrection in the evening, He breathed Himself into His disciples for them to receive the Holy Breath, the Holy Spirit. By that time, the very Triune God had been wrought into the disciples.</p>
<p>After His resurrection, He stayed with the disciples for forty days, and then He met the disciples on a mountain, telling them that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth. He charged them to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:16-19). By that time, after His resurrection and His breathing of the Spirit into the disciples, He could tell the disciples to baptize the nations into the name, into the completed Person, of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<p>The name of the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, implies a lot. We should not merely know the Triune God by a term in Matthew 28:19. We have to realize the full implication of this all-inclusive title&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. It implies God&rsquo;s incarnation, Jesus&rsquo; conception and birth. It implies Jesus&rsquo; human living on this earth and His all-inclusive death on the cross. It also includes His being in the tomb, in Hades, and in death, and His coming back to the earth through resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit. After this He ascended to the heavens, fully accomplishing the very process for the Triune God to go through to be the consummated Spirit. He then poured out this Spirit, and this Spirit poured out of the Triune God from the heavens became the strongest factor, on the Lord&rsquo;s side, of His move on this earth.</p>
<p>On one side, God&rsquo;s move depends upon Himself as the consummated Spirit. He needs us as the other side so there could be the possibility of accomplishment. If we do not render Him any kind of cooperation or give Him any kind of response, nothing can happen, regardless of how powerful, dynamic, and mighty the Holy Spirit of the Triune God can be. God can do the work of creation by Himself but not the work of the new creation. The new creation work must be carried out in the principle of incarnation, the principle of God being one with man, making one entity out of two elements with no third element produced. The Holy Spirit is the power, the means, and the factor for God&rsquo;s move on this earth, but that is just on one side. There is the need of another side, the human side. There is the need of another factor&mdash;the one accord.</p>
<p>If there had been no one accord on the earth in Acts 1, the powerful and dynamic Spirit could have never been poured out. There would have been no vessels to take Him, receive Him, contain Him, and express Him. Thus, the one accord is critical. It is a response to God&rsquo;s doing, a coordination or cooperation offered to God for His move. The Lord&rsquo;s move on God&rsquo;s side depends upon the consummated Spirit and on our side depends upon one accord. Before the pouring out of the Spirit, there was a group of people praying together with one accord (Acts 1:14). That one accord was a preparation for them to receive the pouring out of the Spirit. After this pouring out, they remained and continued in this one accord along with the three thousand saved on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:46). This one accord was the basic factor of the Lord&rsquo;s move through the entire book of Acts.</p>
<p>Romans is a book on the principles of the Christian life and the church life, yet in 15:6 it charges us with the same thing&mdash;one accord. If there is no one accord, it is hard for the church to go on, and it is hard to have the church life. In 1 Corinthians Paul speaks of the one accord again, telling the Corinthians to &ldquo;speak the same thing&rdquo; (1:10). In Philippians we are charged strongly and repeatedly that for the proper experience of Christ in the proper church life, the one accord surely is needed (1:27; 2:2; 4:2). The one accord means one mind and one will with one purpose, wrapped up with our soul and heart.</p>
<p>The matter of one accord controls the entire revelation concerning the Lord&rsquo;s move on one side. If there were no Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s side, it would be impossible for the Lord to move on this earth at all. In the same principle, without the one accord on our side, God cannot move. We have to match God. He is now the consummated Spirit, and we have to say, &ldquo;Lord, we are ready here as the very one accord. We want to not only render but we are also ready to offer to You this one accord.&rdquo; Immediately there is a kind of marriage, and a couple comes out. Then anything can be done.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HOLDING FACTOR OF THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>If you expect to have one accord in any kind of society, group, or movement, you need the same kind of thinking that comes out of the same kind of knowledge. The Socialist party stresses socialism. Any political party has its own &ldquo;ism.&rdquo; They stress their &ldquo;ism&rdquo; in order to have a party, to have what we call the one accord. Without the one accord, no party could accomplish anything. Any society, group, or movement needs this one accord that comes out of the same kind of thought, the same kind of knowledge. Therefore, Acts tells us that on the one hand, there was one accord among the disciples, and on the other hand, all those who were one in one accord were continuing in the teaching of the apostles (2:42). The teaching of the apostles was the very holding factor of the one accord. If there were more than one teaching, this would damage the holding factor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LEADERSHIP IN GOD&rsquo;S MOVE IN ACTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Peter&rsquo;s Leadership in Acts 1&mdash;12</h2>
<p>Now let us look into the book of Acts, which is a record of the Lord&rsquo;s people soon after His ascension. From the time the Lord Jesus began His ministry in the heavens, His people acted on the earth. In the book of Acts there are two sections. Chapters one through twelve are the first section, and chapters thirteen through twenty-eight are the second section. In the first twelve chapters the Lord&rsquo;s move with one accord was according to Peter&rsquo;s teaching. At that time, John was there also, but the teaching was not given through two persons. It was given through Peter. Even though John went with Peter and was with Peter much of the time, the mouthpiece was only one. There is no message recorded in Acts that was given by John. Acts 2:42 says, &ldquo;They were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.&rdquo; In this verse &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; is plural, but we must realize that the mouthpiece in giving the teachings was one.</p>
<p>In the first section of Acts, we see that Peter had his weaknesses and that he even made mistakes. Chapter ten shows us that Peter was not that strong in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. He was still remaining, at least partially, in God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy. When God showed him the unclean animals and told him to eat, Peter responded, &ldquo;By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean&rdquo; (10:14). This response was something of God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy. Although Peter was taught directly and personally by the Lord Jesus for three and a half years and was trained so much and used so much as the top speaker of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, he still remained in the old dispensation. This was his shortcoming and his weakness. Peter was greatly adjusted and corrected but not in full.</p>
<p>At the time of Galatians 2, Paul was a learner compared with Peter. Peter was a first generation apostle and Paul was the second generation. While Peter was the top apostle, Paul as Saul of Tarsus was a young man persecuting the apostles, opposing the church, and trying to defeat the Lord&rsquo;s move. Paul, a younger apostle, rebuked Peter to his face, pointing out Peter&rsquo;s hypocrisy in remaining in the old dispensation (2:11-14). In Acts 10 Peter&rsquo;s problem was concerning the matter of eating, and in Galatians 2 it was the same. When some Judaized believers came from James, a godly man always trying to compromise with the old economy of God, Peter took the lead to shrink back and separate himself from the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Before the men came down from James in Jerusalem, Peter, Barnabas, and the rest of the Jews were eating with the Gentiles because Peter had been adjusted by the Lord in Acts 10. Peter, though, took the lead to practice hypocrisy, and the rest of the Jews and Barnabas followed him. In Acts 10 Peter was short, but in Galatians 2 he was weak. To be short means that you do not have something. To be weak means that you have it, but you dare not to keep it. As a result, Peter made a big mistake, nearly leading the entire church to go astray from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. In order to take care of the truth of the gospel, Paul did not tolerate the situation for one minute. Even though Peter was older than he, Paul rebuked him to his face. Peter made such a big mistake, though he was the mouthpiece in the first twelve chapters of Acts.</p>
<p>The Catholic teaching is that Peter was the successor of Christ, and as His successor he could never have made a mistake. The Catholic church also maintains that it could never be mistaken. Their people are taught to listen to the church, but what they mean by the church is the pope. Whatever the pope says means everything to them. They say that the pope cannot make a mistake. To them all the popes are successors of Peter, and Peter was the successor of Christ. Actually the popes have made many mistakes. One great mistake was a decree saying that Mary, the so-called &ldquo;holy mother,&rdquo; the &ldquo;mother of God,&rdquo; was sinless! What a great mistake! My point is this&mdash;do not think that any leader could not make a mistake. Only the Lord Jesus, the unique Leader, never made any mistake. It is absolutely impossible for Him to be mistaken. However, all of us, including Peter, have made many mistakes.</p><h2 class="head2">Paul&rsquo;s Leadership in Acts 13&mdash;28</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Problem with Barnabas</h2>
<p>In the last section of Acts all the churches acted and moved according to Paul&rsquo;s teaching. When Paul began his ministry, he was the youngest one among the apostles. Barnabas was the brother who brought Paul into practical fellowship with the disciples in Jerusalem (Acts 9:26-27) and who brought Paul into the ministry (Acts 11:22, 25-26). Paul owed Barnabas so much. Barnabas was a &ldquo;senior&rdquo; and Paul was a &ldquo;junior.&rdquo; Eventually, both of them were sent from Antioch (Acts 13:2-4), and by being sent they became the apostles, the sent ones (Acts 14:4). At the initiation of their apostolic ministry, Barnabas&rsquo;s name was mentioned first (13:2, 7). At a certain point, however, Saul&rsquo;s name was changed to Paul, and he began to speak (13:9). From that time, Paul took the lead in the apostolic ministry all the way.</p>
<p>Paul was following the lead of Barnabas, but at a certain point there was the need for someone to speak. Probably while Barnabas was wondering what to say, Paul rose up and spoke. From that time Paul went on to speak a lot, and he took over the leadership. They were sent again from Antioch by the church to Jerusalem to solve the problem of circumcision (Acts 15:2). After returning to Antioch and encouraging the saints with the solution to this problem, they prepared to go out on their second journey. Barnabas proposed to bring his cousin Mark, but Paul would not agree, and there was a contention between them (Acts 15:39). Who would you agree with? Barnabas was older than Paul, more qualified and experienced, and the one who brought Paul into the fellowship and the ministry. Which opinion would you have taken? Surely we would have taken the opinion from the one who was older, more experienced, and from the one who brought the other into the ministry.</p>
<p>After this contention between Barnabas and Paul, they separated from each other, and Barnabas no longer appears in the divine record in Acts of the Lord&rsquo;s move in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. What was the reason for Barnabas&rsquo;s making such an issue? The reason was that Barnabas was the initiator of Paul. But at a certain point, the divine revelation went to Paul. Barnabas did not have the portion of God&rsquo;s revelation that Paul did. The older and more experienced Barnabas, though, wanted to propose something for their second journey, not based upon the revelation, the vision, but based upon probably some kind of natural relationship. Barnabas decided to separate from Paul. He was taking the lead. While they were on their journey, though, God&rsquo;s revelation went to the younger one. Barnabas, the older one, probably still thought he was taking the lead. If he were not assuming the leadership, he surely would have listened to Paul. Barnabas assumed at least a part of the leadership, if not in full.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Smoothness with Aquila and Priscilla</h2>
<p>Aquila and Priscilla were very much for the Lord, but when they came in, they came into the flow of the Lord&rsquo;s move under the one leadership, the leadership of Paul. At the beginning of Acts 18 we can see this (vv. 1-4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Problem with Apollos</h2>
<p>But at the end of the same chapter another one came in by the name of Apollos (vv. 24-28). Apollos was a man who had a lot of Bible knowledge and who was gifted in expounding the Bible. Many people received help from his teaching of the Bible. According to my study of the holy Word, this man never got into the flow that was going on through Paul&rsquo;s teaching, so he was never under the one leadership of Paul. This was the reason why some in Corinth were able to say, &ldquo;I am of Apollos&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:4). A kind of competition and rivalry was there. If Apollos had gotten into the flow of the Lord&rsquo;s move under Paul&rsquo;s teaching and under Paul&rsquo;s leadership, I do not think anyone would have put him into a rivalry with Paul. Peter was in the leadership in the first section of the Acts, and Paul was in another leadership in the second section of Acts. But there is no hint in the Bible that Apollos had any leadership.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians Paul was humble. He said, &ldquo;What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Ministers through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each one. I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow&rdquo; (3:4-6). His illustration, however, still shows he is in the leadership because he tells us he is a planter. A waterer is much less important than a planter. Without a planter, there is no plant. Paul also said in 1 Corinthians 3 that he was a wise master builder who had laid a unique foundation which no one else was able to lay (vv. 10-11). Apollos could water, but he could not lay the foundation. He might do a lot of building work on this foundation. One thousand Apolloses could do this, but the foundation was unique and was laid by a unique leader&mdash;Paul as the wise master builder.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Greek word for master builder is <em>architeckton</em> which really means architect. An architect is the one who gives the design and who superintends the building work. He is the real leader. Neither the contractor nor the foreman is the real leader. The architect is the one who directs, and his word is the word that counts. The Bible likens God&rsquo;s move in this universe to a building. God is the very builder, but he needs an architect. The one who takes the leadership in God&rsquo;s move should be one who can give the design and do the superintending work to give the proper instructions. Regardless of how much humility Paul exercised in writing 1 Corinthians, he still stated the facts. He was a planter, and Apollos was not; and he was the unique wise architect who gave the design and who superintended the building work.</p><h2 class="head3">Leadership Depending upon Teaching</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s leadership goes through the second section of Acts to the end of Hebrews. His leadership was altogether based upon his divine revelation because in the divine revelation the design can be seen. In other words, the divine revelation is the blueprint, the design. Regardless of how much Barnabas could do or Apollos could teach, they never put out a design, a blueprint. We cannot read one chapter of Barnabas&rsquo;s or Apollos&rsquo;s writings in the Bible. But Paul has fourteen Epistles in the Scriptures. His blueprint is perfect, completed, and finished in all details. We do not have another blueprint. If there were two blueprints and two designers in the building work, this would create trouble and confusion. Some would build and others would tear down. While the building is going on, there would be fighting.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s leadership was based upon his divine revelation, which is the real design of God&rsquo;s building. The designer&rsquo;s instructions concerning the building are according to his blueprint. In the Lord&rsquo;s move on this earth from Acts through Hebrews, there was one teaching and one leadership based upon this one teaching. In the first twelve chapters of Acts was the teaching given by Peter, and the leadership was based upon his teaching. Thus, the leadership was with Peter. In the last sixteen chapters of Acts was the teaching and the revelation of Paul, and the leadership was based upon his teaching. Thus, the leadership was with Paul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE WORD OF THE LEADERSHIP</h2>
<p>In both of these leaderships, there was the practice of taking the word of the leadership. Paul told Timothy to go somewhere and he went (1 Cor. 4:17). Paul told another one to stay in a certain place and he stayed (Titus 1:5). Today&rsquo;s practice is that the one taking the lead would not dare to say, &ldquo;Brother so-and-so, go to that place.&rdquo; Today&rsquo;s leaders would not do this. Everybody pretends to be so spiritual.</p>
<p>A brother in the leadership may tell another brother, &ldquo;In these days I have been very much with the Lord concerning your future. I feel that you need to go to the Lord and see what he will tell you concerning going to Greece.&rdquo; Then the brother may respond that he is not clear, so he will go to the Lord and pray. Actually, this brother has already decided that he would never go to Greece. Greece was not his choice, but he was pretending to be very spiritual. He would not say that he did not like Greece. Instead he would say, &ldquo;I will bring this matter to the Lord. I will pray and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading.&rdquo; Deep in his being, though, he has already made the decision not to go. He may wait for a whole week before he would let the brother who is taking the lead know what his decision is. When he comes back he might say, &ldquo;I have been praying desperately, day after day, and I was made clear that the Lord does not want me to go to Greece.&rdquo; This is very &ldquo;spiritual.&rdquo; The leader is &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; and the follower is &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; but there is no spirituality. Then who goes to Greece? Maybe only a brother who could not do anything would feel burdened to go. This is today&rsquo;s poor situation.</p>
<p>From 1932 to 1949 in mainland China I had no thought about being in the leadership and I never wanted to be a leader. In this matter of sending others, not only did others pretend to be spiritual but I did also. I may have been so sure that a certain brother should go to Greece, but I did not want to be considered as a dictator or be misunderstood as being a pope who gives decrees to others. I may have said to a brother, &ldquo;Do you realize that in Greece there is some need? Would you please pray about this, and pray to the Lord to see if you are the right person to go?&rdquo; Actually within me, the brother I was talking to was the right person already. I confess that I was timid because I was quite concerned about being designated as a dictator or controller.</p>
<p>I can boast that no church in the United States has ever received a letter from me telling them what to do. The leading ones in the churches can testify this for me. Whenever the brothers came to me, I always told them to go back to the Lord and pray. Some have said that there is no need to go to Brother Lee because he always answers the same way&mdash;&ldquo;Go to the Lord and pray.&rdquo; Seemingly I was &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; yet there was some pretense.</p>
<p>I must confess that none among us, including me, dared to practice the truth in the genuineness of the proper way. In the Acts and the Epistles Paul told Timothy and his other co-workers to go to certain places, to remain in other places, and to come to him (Acts 17:14-15; 19:22; Phil. 2:19, 25; Col. 4:7-8; 1 Tim. 1:3; 2 Tim. 4:9, 11-12, 21; Titus 1:5; 3:12). He gave the orders. There was not one among his co-workers who received an order from him that would say, &ldquo;Let me pray for a couple of days and I will let you know.&rdquo; Their practice was absolutely different from our present practice because they all honored the same leadership based upon the same divine revelation.</p>
<p>We have not practiced in this way because of the strong background and heavy surrounding of Christianity. On the one hand, control is practiced along with hierarchy, especially in Catholicism with the pope as the highest authority. Then there is the so-called &ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; which is actually a kind of scattering or dispersion. This kind of so-called freedom, which is actually a dispersion or scattering, is worse than controlling because it does more damage to the church, the Body of Christ. To some extent controlling is always hated. But the dispersion or scattering under the cloak of freedom is somewhat welcomed. In Protestantism both control and dispersion can be seen. A capable minister, a strong and knowledgeable teacher, might exercise control. Others would not go along with this kind of control. They want to stay in a kind of dispersed freedom.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE&rsquo;S INTRINSIC SUFFERING</h2>
<p>The Lord raised up His recovery in mainland China in 1922 with Brother Nee, and I joined him in 1932. We two stayed and worked together for about eighteen years, from 1932 to 1949. He was an &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; that I was under. No rain dropped upon me, and no arrows, no attacks, were directed at me. I saw how Brother Nee was attacked and how much he suffered. I also saw his intrinsic suffering. Many co-workers, responsible ones, and leaders, most of whom were not appointed by anyone but self-appointed, all claimed that they accepted Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry. Actually, if they had not accepted Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry, they would have had nothing to accept. His ministry was the unique ministry of the New Testament. If they had not accepted his ministry, they would have had to go to the teachings of the denominations, and they were tired of that. They claimed that they took Brother Nee&rsquo;s teachings, that they received Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry, yet in actuality or in practicality none cared for Brother Nee. Everyone acted on his own for the recovery, receiving the one, unique ministry of Brother Nee. This was Brother Nee&rsquo;s intrinsic suffering.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Shortage of One Accord</h2>
<p>The recovery in mainland China from 1922 to 1949 was very prevailing in teaching, in the divine revelation, but not so prevailing in practice. As far as practice goes, it was rather weak. Shanghai and Chefoo were the only two churches that had over two hundred members. What has always been the factor that puts down the recovery? The lacking of the one accord. The churches in mainland China accepted the same ministry and received the same kind of teaching, yet in practice they were all different. Some of them were proud of their difference to some extent. They received the teaching from the Brethren telling them that the local churches should be different. The Brethren taught this based upon the fact that the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are all different. They did not see the light that the seven churches were different, not in their testimony, but in their degradation. The poor situation of the degraded churches was different, but the lampstands are identical.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Recovery of Brother Nee&rsquo;s Ministry</h2>
<p>Brother Nee stayed away from his ministry until the revival that started in Chefoo in 1940 was brought over to Shanghai in 1947. In 1948 a revival broke out in Shanghai, which laid the foundation for Brother Nee to come back. He came back, not on his own, but through the change of the situation. Many repented. During the six years of Brother Nee&rsquo;s absence, there was nothing in the recovery. Every place was nearly starved to death except for Chefoo where there was a revival. The entire recovery was in a famine. The dissenting ones realized that they had nothing, that they could do nothing, and that they could not go on.</p>
<p>In 1948, I went to visit Brother Nee&rsquo;s hometown since I was invited by the church there. I spent three weeks with the church and a revival was brought in. Many were baptized within this period of time. Brother Nee&rsquo;s home was in a suburb. I made an appointment with him, asking him to give me and my two other co-workers a time with him after my stay with the church for three weeks. He was happy to give me this appointment.</p>
<p>About thirty to forty co-workers and leading ones from nearby cities were attending the meetings of the revival. After the last meeting, I thought they would all leave. When I came to the meeting place, though, many of them were lingering there and talking. I asked them why they were still there. They said smiling that they had heard I was going to have a time with Brother Nee. I told them that this time was for me and my two co-workers, but they insisted on joining our fellowship with Brother Nee. They told me that they had no way to talk to Brother Nee, so they were waiting for me to do something for them. They took me as a mediator for them to get access to Brother Nee. When I went to Brother Nee and told him their request, he said no. They still insisted and asked me to go back again to Brother Nee to tell him that they would not go and that they begged permission to join our fellowship.</p>
<p>Eventually Brother Nee agreed to let them come to that fellowship. In his home there was a large living room with a big opening leading to the dining room. Brother Nee said he would fellowship with us three and would also invite Brother K. H. Weigh from Hong Kong to join us. He said he would fellowship with the four of us in the very inner corner of his living room. He asked me to tell the others who were begging for permission to fellowship with him to sit outside the living room far away in the dining room in a corner somewhat separated by a half partition. He wanted me to charge them not to go out to say a word after listening to what he said, and he said they had to promise me this. He also wanted me to assure him that I would bear the responsibility for all of them in this matter. This shows you that Brother Nee stopped his function because of the different talk, the different speakings. I went back to the brothers with this charge, and they assured me that they would not say anything, so Brother Nee permitted them to come.</p>
<p>After the first morning of fellowship, a sister took the lead to say, &ldquo;Brother Nee, since we heard this, why don&rsquo;t we practice it?&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t we practice this, Brother Nee?&rdquo; Brother Nee looked at me and said that if these dear ones wanted to practice this, they would have to deliver themselves up, to hand themselves over to the ministry. When everyone heard this, they said, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; This was an indication that Brother Nee was very much troubled and bothered by the different talks. Everybody had the freedom to do whatever was right in his own eyes. Brother Nee was tired of this, so he told the co-workers and leading ones that if they wanted a new start, they would have to hand themselves over to the ministry. Otherwise, he would not take the lead or say anything to them.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LOSS OF THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In Taiwan</h2>
<p>We need to realize that if the one accord is absent, everything is gone. There was a time when the real one accord was among the eight hundred saints in my hometown of Chefoo. This issued in a revival there. This revival was brought over not in full but partially to Shanghai. When I went to Taiwan I had learned from our past what was useful and what was not prevailing. I dropped what was not useful or prevailing, and we had a marvelous beginning in Taiwan. Anyone who was there in those first six years can testify of the one accord, the morale, and the impact. Within this period of time our number increased from about four hundred to forty thousand, a hundredfold increase. Ninety percent of the new believers among us did not turn this way from Christianity but were typical Gentiles. The impact was with us.</p>
<p>Then the thought and the seeking after so-called spirituality came in among the leading ones. As a result, Brother Austin-Sparks was invited to come, and that brought in the beginning of the dissension. Since that time, the one accord never came back to Taiwan. The intrinsic reason that I left Taiwan and came to this country was this matter. About ten young co-workers, some of whom were brought to the Lord and trained by me, were influenced by Austin-Sparks&rsquo; concept to tear down, to overthrow, the church ground. They became dissenting to my teaching, and this made the situation in Taiwan no longer pleasant to me. Once a wife commits fornication, the marriage can be recovered, but the pleasant feeling is gone. There is no sweetness in the marriage. That was my feeling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the United States</h2>
<p>After I came to the United States, in the first ten years in Los Angeles there was the morale. About 1970, though, some came in with ambition. This brought in a real damage. Because of this, the one accord was lost among us in the United States. Even up to today, the one accord has not come back.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A NEW START BY RECOVERING THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>By October of 1984 I was clear about the situation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States and even more clear about the situation on the island of Taiwan. I felt led by the Lord to go back to the source of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery outside of the mainland of China and to clear up that sulphur source. When I went there, I made it clear that we had to drop all our old practices and that we had to have a new start.</p>
<p>The Lord did something in Taiwan and the news came to the United States. While I was doing something in Taiwan for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, I had no intention to spread or push it in the United States. My thought was to first raise up a model in Taiwan. Then we would have something as a base and as a pattern to follow. Because today the globe is so small, some brothers went to Taiwan and the news came back to the United States. Many of the churches, especially in Orange County, California, began to do the same thing. According to my observation that was merely a kind of copying. I knew that to merely copy something would not work, so this caused me great concern. The source of the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in His move is the matter of being in one accord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW WAY TO CARRY ON THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>I hope that you would take care of the following fellowship because it is very, very crucial. I feel led to practice the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move by dropping all our practices in the past. We have to reconsider our way to go on in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and we must have a new start. We could not have any new vision, new revelation, new teaching. The earth was made by God and no one can change it. But the way to travel around the globe should be improved again and again. Man has improved from walking to the use of wheels, from the mule wagon to the train and automobile, and from the single engine airplane to the 747. In like manner, we have to improve the way to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The way we had was too old. It was like traveling from the east coast to the west coast by mule wagon. This old practice should not be here today. What we need first in this new practice is to recover the one accord.</p>
<p>Your being a local church does not depend upon whether or not you take this new way. This is not a movement and this is not a term or condition for a church to be recognized as a local church. Whether or not you take this way, as long as you are standing on the church ground, recognizing not only your church but also all the other churches in the recovery as local churches, you are a local church. If a local church did not take this new way and we stopped recognizing it as a local church, this would be sectarian. This is not the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery with the all-inclusive church life. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, as the all-inclusive church, we do not cut off anyone. When I was in the church in Los Angeles, we never cut off anyone who spoke in tongues. We do not cut off any believers in the practice of the all-inclusive church life.</p>
<p>However, for the Lord&rsquo;s move to have an impact, we need the recovery of the one accord. To be citizens of the United States is one thing, but for these citizens to be formed into an army to fight the battle for the United States is another thing. This does not mean that if you are not in the army, you are no longer a United States citizen. You are still citizens, but you are not fighting for the country. In the Old Testament there was a judge whose name was Gideon, and he took only three hundred to form an army to fight the battle. The Lord even told him not to have too many (Judg. 7:3-7). We are not burdened to stir up a kind of movement. What we are burdened to do is to sound a trumpet, letting the children of God know what the Lord is doing today. The Lord is calling His dear saints, who would be willing to be brought back to the one accord, to fight the battle.</p><h2 class="head1">JOB-DROPPING AND MONEY-MAKING FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>What should we do? Everyone who would take this new way must be a full-timer. Full-timers are of two kinds&mdash; job-dropping full-timers and money-making full-timers. All must be full-timers. Either you drop your job to preach, to teach, to visit people, and to work for the church full-time, or you remain in your job to make money for the Lord&rsquo;s move. Even if you earned two million dollars a year, you should not spend more than what is required for the need of your actual living. Suppose that you and your family only need two thousand five hundred dollars a month or thirty thousand dollars a year for your proper, actual living expenses. Then you should only spend that much and give the rest to the Lord&rsquo;s move. This is not a regulation and no one would regulate you. With your pure conscience and the indwelling Spirit you should regulate yourself to be a money-making full-timer. Even a mother of six children has to be a full-timer. She must do her best to help her husband, to take care of the family, to make more money, and to spend every cent besides the needs of her family for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONE ACCORD BROUGHT INTO BEING<br />
UNDER THE ONE LEADERSHIP<br />
BASED UPON THE UNIQUE TEACHING,<br />
THE DIVINE REVELATION</h2>
<p>All those who take this call to be full-timers have to learn how to be in one accord. This one accord could only come into being under the one leadership, and the one, unique leadership is altogether based upon the unique teaching, the divine revelation. We must admit according to the biblical truth that God is one, the Lord is one, the Spirit is one, and Christ&rsquo;s Body is one, which means the church is one universally and the testimony is one. Also, the work of the Lord is one, the teaching is one, and the leadership is one. Based upon all these &ldquo;ones,&rdquo; we surely have the one accord.</p>
<p>Whoever feels burdened and willing to take this new way&mdash;let us go on together. I want to stir up myself, and I want to stir up all of you. Wake up! Sleepers, rise up (Eph. 5:14)! Let us go the way of ones&mdash;one God, one Lord, one Spirit, one Christ, one Body, one church, one testimony, one work, one teaching, one leadership, and then one accord. Do not push others to go this way. Just go this way according to your burden by yourself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WORD OF LOVE, ADVICE, AND WARNING</h2>
<p>I am prepared to meet a situation in which some in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will not go this way. This will not surprise me. You and I should not consider these ones as strangers and should not cut them off from the recovery. We should still love them, respect them, and not despise them a bit. Do not consider them as another kind of people. Although they have not joined the army, they are still proper citizens.</p>
<p>To those who would not take this way, I would give a word of love, advice, and warning. Do not criticize, do not attack, and do not oppose. If you do, you will suffer the loss. This would mean that you would betray the recovery. You would become a betrayer, a traitor. Some may feel that they are not betrayers or traitors but protectors. According to their concept, they do not want to see that I am the unique leader to control the entire recovery. This is a very good cloak for them to put on. I have been with the recovery for fifty-five years, since 1932. In all these years I have not controlled anyone. I do not have the intention to control anybody or to exercise any control. But we need a proper leadership.</p>
<p>If anyone of you could rise up to render the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the proper leadership, I would be the first to follow you, to take your leadership. But what kind of direction can you give us? How much truth do you know? Could you open up the entire New Testament from Matthew to Revelation in a detailed way to bring the churches into the depths of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy? If I am boasting, I am forced to be a fool like the Apostle Paul (2 Cor. 12:11).</p>
<p>There is no hint in the New Testament telling us that in the Lord&rsquo;s move there could or should be more than one leadership. No one can deny this truth. Even the Devil, Satan, has to admit that two plus two is four. If you are going to express your opinion, you must annul the truth I put out. Do not express your opinion; express your knowledge of the truth. We all need to take the revelation in the holy Word and according to the pure Word. Do not twist the Word but cut straight the word of the truth (2 Tim. 2:15). Paul charged Timothy to cut the word as a carpenter in carpentry. Do not cut the Word in a crooked way with some biases. Do not fight, oppose, attack, or criticize anything which is according to the divine truth. You must first go to the Word. You also must study a person&rsquo;s background, his history, his doings, and his teachings to discern his qualifications for taking the lead. My point is this&mdash;since the revelation is here, the teaching is here, the leadership must be here. But the tragedy among today&rsquo;s Christians is that they only like to take the teaching not the leadership. Sometimes they even would give up the teaching.</p><h2 class="head1">TURNING AWAY FROM THE MINISTRY<br />
VERSUS KEEPING THE WORD</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy 1:15 Paul says, &ldquo;...all who are in Asia turned away from me.&rdquo; Asia was a province of the Roman Empire in Asia Minor, far away from Rome where Paul, who was in prison, was writing his Epistle to Timothy. When Paul said that all who were in Asia turned away from him, this does not indicate that they turned away from the person of Paul because the person of Paul was far away from them. This verse indicates that they all turned away from Paul&rsquo;s ministry. Among the churches in Asia was the church in Ephesus, which was fully established by Paul&rsquo;s ministry as recorded in Acts 19. They received the gospel, the teaching, the edification, and the establishment from the ministry of the Apostle Paul. But by the time Paul was imprisoned in Rome, they had all turned away from his ministry.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s second Epistle to Timothy was written about A.D. 68. About thirty years later, the Lord used John to continue His divine revelation. The Lord came back to all the churches in Asia who had turned away from Paul. Because they turned away from Paul&rsquo;s ministry, the churches in Asia declined into a situation full of degradation. The degradation of the churches in Asia as recorded in Revelation 2 and 3 was due to their turning away from the proper ministry. This degradation began with their losing of the first love toward the Lord, which transpired at Ephesus (2:4), and ended with the lukewarmness (3:16), the Christlessness. The Lord as the Head of the church is standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door (3:20).</p>
<p>In these seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, the striking point of the churches&rsquo; degradation was three kinds of teachings: the teaching of Balaam, a Gentile prophet (2:14), the teaching of the Nicolaitans to build the hierarchy (2:15), and the teaching of the woman, the so-called prophetess, Jezebel, full of heresies and fornication (2:20). These three kinds of teachings crept in because they left the teaching of the apostle. Why has Christianity become degraded? Because they turned away from the apostle&rsquo;s teaching. Thus, all the different teachings came in.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:3 and 6:3 Paul warned not to teach differently. The saints should teach according to Paul&rsquo;s teaching. Those in Asia definitely turned away from Paul&rsquo;s teaching, and the result of this turning away was that they received three kinds of heretical teachings. The teaching of Balaam to worship the idols, the teaching of the Nicolaitans to build up the hierarchy, even the papal system, and the teaching of Jezebel to bring the leaven of evil, heretical, and pagan things into the fine flour of Christ (Matt. 13:33) came in because the proper teaching was rejected. Within thirty years after Paul&rsquo;s final Epistle to Timothy, these churches had reached such a point of degradation. It is dangerous to leave or turn away from the apostle&rsquo;s teaching, from the apostle&rsquo;s proper revelation.</p>
<p>The Lord came in these seven epistles to judge those degraded churches. His eyes were as a flame of fire (1:14) to observe, search, and enlighten, and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword (1:16), which is His discerning, judging, and slaying word (Heb. 4:12; Eph. 6:17). They turned away from the right word, so the Lord came with this word to judge them. The Lord&rsquo;s feet were like shining brass, as having been fired in a furnace (1:15). Brass signifies divine judgment (Exo. 27:1-6). The Lord&rsquo;s coming to the churches in such a way fit in with their turning away from the apostle&rsquo;s teaching and their picking up of different teachings.</p>
<p>One church was unique, and was highly appraised by the Lord&mdash;the church in Philadelphia. The Lord highly appraised them and even appreciated them because they kept the word (3:8). That means they did not turn away from the apostle&rsquo;s proper teaching. Although they were weak, the Lord still appraised them highly, telling them that they had a little power and that they had kept the word.</p>
<p>To turn away from the proper teaching is a terrible thing that will result in degradation and in picking up other teachings. I say this as a warning to those dear ones who would not take the new way. To reject the proper revelation, the proper teaching, of the leaders among you is a dangerous thing. You will open the door for other teachings to come in and suffer degradation. I hope that all of the church people in the recovery would not be followers of those in Asia who turned away from Paul&rsquo;s ministry. Rather, I hope we would follow the pattern of the church in Philadelphia&mdash;keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word even though we only have a little strength. Let us keep the word of the Lord, which is to remain in the teachings of the apostle, to remain in the healthy words, to remain in the unique revelation from the Lord with the proper leadership. Then we are safe.</p></body></html>
