   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WARFARE FOR GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The recovery of the building in the Old Testament was fully accomplished by and through warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus said that the gates of Hades, which belong to Satan, would never prevail against the built-up church Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostle Paul speaks specifically about the church in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He speaks about the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the counterpart of Christ, the new man, God s house, and God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lastly, he speaks about the church as the warrior, fighting on behalf of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul himself was a warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before his martyrdom, he declared, I have fought the good fight 2 Tim 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the proper position and responsibility of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan always comes behind God to damage His church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He causes the church to become fallen and degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even when the apostle Paul was on earth, the church had become desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul saw the churches that he had built up with his own hands being damaged by Satan and brought into desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When he wrote the books of Philippians, Colossians, and 1 and 2 Timothy, he was very clear about the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He even said, All who are in Asia turned away from me 2 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church became so desolate that it had even deserted Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet Paul was not discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He exhorted Timothy to war the good warfare 1 Tim 1:18 , which was to fight against the different teachings of the dissenting ones and to accomplish God s economy according to his ministry concerning the gospel of grace and eternal life v. 4 , so that God, who is worthy of all praises, might be glorified vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>11-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time the greatest problem was the different teachings of the dissenting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This problem brought in great damage to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul told Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach different things...rather than God s economy vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For Timothy to do this was for him to war the good warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To war the good warfare is not to swing with our fists or kick with our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is, on the negative side, to defeat and destroy the winds of different teachings, and on the positive side, to carry out God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul clearly points out that it is insufficient merely to not teach different things; we must also speak God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we are faced with the same warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, to war the good warfare, to withstand the downward drift of the church, and to carry out God s economy is to preach the gospel of grace and eternal life according to the apostles ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 6:12 Paul says, Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold on the eternal life, to which you were called.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To fight the good fight is to lay hold on the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This life is the divine life, God s uncreated life, and the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The words eternal life are related more to the divine nature than to time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our Christian life, and especially in our Christian work, we need to lay hold on God s eternal life and not trust in our human life in order to fight the good fight of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the two books of Timothy and the book of Titus repeatedly emphasize the eternal life 1 Tim 1:16; 6:19; 2 Tim 1:1, 10; Titus 1:2; 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This life is a necessary and basic prerequisite in order to accomplish God s economy concerning the church as depicted in 1 Timothy, to withstand the declining trend of the church as depicted in 2 Timothy, and to maintain good order in the church as depicted in Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>OUR WARFARE TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our work today is to build up the home meetings, teach the truth, and spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, it is to beget, nourish, and teach.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are things that are absolutely contrary to what Christianity is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is a move against the tide.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are conscious that we are fighting a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to struggle to swim upstream.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must fight against the current.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Consequently, we encounter difficulty at every stage.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all know that it is easy to flow downstream.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no need to exert any strength; we can easily glide along, but to swim upstream requires a continual struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To press forward requires fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Concerning these three matters, the burden within me is too heavy for words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am already an old man, yet I still need to bear such a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The only way I can explain it is that this is something that the Lord wants.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today the church has been corrupted by Christianity to such an extent that it has fully become a religion and an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In such an organization, two things are produced a clergy-laity system and hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Through the practice of the clergy-laity system, hierarchy is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Catholic Church takes the pope as its head, and the different Protestant groups take their founders as their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Under the pope and these founders, there is a distinct class of people who are different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>People are separated into different categories and classes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This completely obliterates the life relationship among God s children and annuls their organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Through Brother Nee we saw the light sixty years ago that the most important matter in the Lord s recovery is that we be free from any organized religion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During the past sixty years we have paid much attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Still, we admit that we have never rid ourselves fully of its influence even though we emphasize this so much.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have never been completely freed from the bondage of this organized religion because of the entanglement of the power of darkness and our sluggish disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those without the spiritual insight do not see anything concerning the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everyone today says that religion is a good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Furthermore, Satan has even mixed some wicked things with our knowledge of the Bible through his cunning tactics.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The whole of Christianity is an organization of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It can be compared to the big tree described by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It has taken root, settled on the earth, and become a huge organization.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All Christians have been organized together and absorbed into it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord has raised us up to stand against this great organization.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have been fighting this battle for more than sixty years, but to a certain extent, even our own brothers and sisters are not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even our co-workers have become confused, considering that we are the same as Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We consider ourselves the same as Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Look at our situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How are we different from Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Where are the distinctions?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some brothers and sisters even say, Are not some Christians more zealous than we are?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They are also preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As time goes by, black and white seem to be the same, fresh water and salt water become indistinguishable, and the pure and the polluted are mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The reason such a situation has developed is that we have not fully rid ourselves of the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The presence of the concept of a hierarchy results in this kind of an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I hope that we will understand the fellowship in this message in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I hope that by the grace of the Lord we will take this clear word.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need to admit that two years ago in 1984 the clergy-laity system was very strong among us, even here in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We did not have the form, but we had the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In order to deal with this matter, we saw from the Lord that we needed to deal with this from its roots.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must remove this practice from among us completely; otherwise, we will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This was why I have spoken so strongly against the big meetings and emphasized the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I made it clear from the beginning that eventually the small group meetings should be brought into the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Once the meetings move to the homes and the church life is established in the homes, the clergy-laity system will have no more ground.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Once the clergy-laity system loses its ground, the system of hierarchy will be uprooted and removed.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I am not speaking empty teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I am speaking facts based on our history.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hence, what we now need the most is for the elders, the co-workers, and the full-timers to become absolutely clear that it is not a small thing for us to set up home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We are transplanting our produce from the realm of religion to the homes of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Once they are transplanted to the homes, there will be no further opportunity for the clergy-laity system to surface.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If every home has a meeting, every person is speaking, and no one wants to be the head, how can the clergy-laity system remain?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>However, if we cannot achieve these three ends, the clergy-laity system will remain, and the religious organization will continue.</S>
