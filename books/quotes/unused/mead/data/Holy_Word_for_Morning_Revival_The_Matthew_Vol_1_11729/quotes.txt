[3]  Heb 1:1-2 God, having spoken of old in many portions to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son
[4]  1 1 The first name and the last name Rev 22:21 in the New Testament is Jesus, proving that Jesus Christ is the subject and content of the New Testament.
[5]  The Gospel of Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of the heavens to the earth.
[6]  Matt1:1 The book of the generation of 1 Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
[7]  Gal 2:20 I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
[8]  Matt 1:2 Abraham begot 1 Isaac, and Isaac begot 2 Jacob, and Jacob begot 3 Judah and his brothers.
[9]  Rom 9:7-8 "In Isaac shall your seed be called," that is, it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are accounted as the seed.
[10]  1 Cor 1:30 But of Him you are in Christ Jesus
[11]  16-17 And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
[12]  His relationship with Christ was indirect, through the marriage of Joseph, his descendant, to Mary, of whom Christ was born v. 16 . The Old Testament did not say that Christ would be Solomon's descendant, but it prophesied repeatedly that Christ would be a descendant of David 2 Sam 7:13-14; Jer 23:5 .
[13]  Outline The King's antecedents and status 1:1 2:23 His genealogy and office called Christ 1:1-17 Crucial Points
[14]  In the Old Testament, God spoke by the prophets, and in the New Testament, He spoke in the Son, in the person of the Son Heb 1:1-2 .
[15]  18 Now the origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, after she had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child 1 of the Holy Spirit.
[16]  20 But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been 1 begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.
[17]  Matt 1:21 And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus
[18]  23 "Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel" which is translated, God with us .
[19]  1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
[20]  1 Now in those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea
[21]  2 And saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
[22]  13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.
[23]  1 Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.
[24]  The Lord Jesus was physically hungry, and the tempter came to Him and said, "If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread" v. 3 . To this proposal the Lord replied, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God" v. 4 . This word reveals that while the Lord Jesus was fasting, He was eating.
[25]  Outline The King's antecedents and status 1:1 2:23 His origin and name born a God-man, named Jesus, called Emmanuel by men 1:18-25 His youth and growth called a Nazarene 2:1-23 Sought and worshipped by the Gentile magi vv.
[26]  12 Now when He heard that John was delivered up, He 1 withdrew into Galilee.
[27]  1 And when He saw the crowds, He 1 went up to the mountain.
[28]  Matt 5:3 Blessed are the 1 poor in 2 spirit, for theirs is the 3 kingdom of the heavens.
[29]  3 1 To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble but also to be emptied in our spirit, not holding on to the old things of the old dispensation but unloaded to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens.
[30]  3 2 Spirit here refers not to the Spirit of God but to our human spirit, the organ by which we contact God and realize spiritual things.
[31]  It comprises eternity without beginning before the foundation of the world, the chosen patriarchs including the paradise of Adam , the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament, the coming millennial kingdom including its heavenly part, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, and its earthly part, the Messianic kingdom , and the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem in eternity without end. The kingdom of the heavens is a specific section within the kingdom of God, a section composed only of the church today and the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom.
[32]  In the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom, which is the kingdom of the heavens manifested in power, the overcoming believers will reign with Christ for a thousand years Rev 20:4, 6 ; in the earthly part of the millennial kingdom, which is the Messianic kingdom on earth, the saved remnant of Israel will be the priests and will teach the nations to worship God Zech 8:20-23 .
[33]  7 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy.
[34]  8 Blessed are the 1 pure in heart, for they shall 2 see God.
[35]  11 1 When we live a life for the kingdom of the heavens, in the spiritual nature of the kingdom and according to the heavenly principles of the kingdom, we are reproached, persecuted, and evilly spoken of, mostly by the religious people, who hold to their traditional religious concepts.
[36]  6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
[37]  Outline The King's ministry 4:12 11:30 The beginning of the ministry 4:12-25 The decree of the kingdom's constitution 5:1 7:29 Concerning the nature of the kingdom people 5:1-12 Crucial Points
[38]  13 You are the 1 salt of the earth.
[39]  17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to 1 fulfill.
[40]  18 For truly I say to you, Until 1 heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass.
[41]  19 Therefore whoever annuls one of the least of these 1 commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever practices and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.
[42]  17 1 Here for Christ to fulfill the law means 1 that, on the positive side, He kept the law, 2 that, on the negative side, through His substitutionary death on the cross He fulfilled the requirement of the law, and 3 that in this section He complemented the old law with His new law, as repeatedly expressed by the word "But I say to or, tell you" vv.
[43]  20 For I say to you that unless your 1 righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means 2 enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
[44]  20 1 Righteousness here does not refer only to objective righteousness, which is the Christ whom we receive when we believe in Him and are thus justified before God 1 Cor 1:30; Rom 3:26 ; it refers even more to subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future.
[45]  This righteousness of the kingdom people, which is according to the new law of the kingdom, surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, which is according to the old law.
[46]  20 2 Entrance into the kingdom of God requires regeneration as a new beginning of our life John 3:3, 5 , but entrance into the kingdom of the heavens demands surpassing righteousness in our living after regeneration.
[47]  23 Therefore if you are offering your 1 gift at the 2 altar and there you remember that your brother has 3 something against you,
[48]  In decreeing the new law of the kingdom, the King referred here to the gift and altar of the old dispensation because during the period of His ministry on earth, a transitional period, the ritual law of the old dispensation had not yet come to an end. In the four Gospels, before His death and resurrection, in matters regarding the outward circumstances, the Lord treated His disciples as Jews according to the old law, whereas in matters concerning spirit and life, He considered them believers, constituents of the church, according to the New Testament economy.
[49]  22 But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment .And whoever says, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.
[50]  31 And it was said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorcement.
[51]  Matthew 5:13-16, the second section of the kingdom's decree, concerns the influence of the kingdom people upon the world.
[52]  1 1 But take care not to do your 2 righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward.
[53]  2 Therefore when you give alms, do not 1 sound a trumpet before you as the 2 hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men.
[54]  9 You then pray 1 in this way: Our Father who is in the heavens, 2 Your name be sanctified;
[55]  10 Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on 1 earth.
[56]  This is being fulfilled in this age, and it will be ultimately fulfilled in the coming kingdom age, when the name of God will be excellent in all the earth Psa 8:1 , the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ Rev 11:15 , and the will of God will be accomplished.
[57]  19 Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth.
[58]  1 1 Do 2 not judge, that you be not judged.
[59]  2 For 1 with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you.
[60]  13 1 Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to 2 destruction, and many are those who enter through it.
[61]  21 Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will 1 enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.
[62]  22 Many will say to Me in 1 that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?
[63]  The fourth section of the King's decree on the mountain, Matthew 6:1-18, concerns the righteous deeds of the kingdom people.
