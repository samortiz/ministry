   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE PARTS OF MAN AN EVIL HEART OF UNBELIEF</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>DESERTING THE LIVING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this message we need to cover three matters: an evil heart of unbelief deserting the living God; the living word of God; and the parts of man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hebrews 3:12 says, Beware, brothers, lest there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in withdrawing from the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No heart is more evil than a heart of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nothing offends God as much as our unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>David committed a dreadful sin, murdering a man and taking his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Governmentally speaking, however, this sin was not that serious, for it did not cause God to give up David.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the unbelief of the children of Israel in the wilderness caused God to give them up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Unbelief insults and offends God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every sin breaks God s righteous law, but some sins do not insult God Himself, as does the sin of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I. THE LIVING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our God is the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unbelief is so evil because it insults the living, faithful, and almighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not believe in God, in His work and in His ways, we insult Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why we must beware of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 10 says, Wherefore I was disgusted with this generation, and I said, They always go astray in heart; and they have not known My ways.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s ways are different from His acts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His acts are His activities; His ways are the principles by which He acts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The children of Israel only knew His acts, but Moses knew His ways Psa 103:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the wilderness the children of Israel saw a miracle nearly every morning the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If such a miracle would occur today, it would be publicized in newspapers throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the children of Israel witnessed such a miracle, they, unlike Moses, saw only the acts of God; they did not know God s faithful, divine ways.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not be like the children of Israel; we must learn the ways, the principles, of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the children of Israel lacked food and water, they complained and murmured.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When God acted on their behalf, they were happy temporarily, but not long afterward they offended God again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we look at ourselves, we would not criticize them, because we would see that we are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may shout, Praise the Lord! one night in a meeting and murmur against the Lord the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How we need to know the ways of God!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our God is living and has His principles in doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will never deny Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is able, almighty, and faithful, always keeping His promises and fulfilling His word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE EVIL HEART</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although God is living and faithful, the evil heart is hardened against Him 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a sense, an evil heart is very reasonable; it reasons a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, in another sense, it is stubborn and without reason because it is hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, it departs from the right track and goes astray, not knowing God s ways or principles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It tries God by putting Him to the test 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, such a heart is self-deceiving and will be deceived 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the condition of an evil heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such an evil heart always issues from the hardening.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How dangerous it is for our heart to be hardened!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to pray again and again for the Lord to soften our heart, saying, Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Soften my heart and never allow it to be hardened.</S>
