OF THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Many people think that the Gospel of Matthew is quite long and full of doctrines, such as the Lord&rsquo;s words in chapters 5, 6, and 7, which are known in Christianity as the Sermon on the Mount. However, in 28:19, after the Lord Jesus had spoken concerning so many &ldquo;doctrines&rdquo; and prophecies, He said to the disciples, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; <em>All the nations</em> refers to the people in every country of the world. For example, Japanese, Filipinos, Chinese, and Indonesians are included in &ldquo;all the nations.&rdquo; The Lord, however, did not charge the disciples to go and preach doctrines to the nations but rather to &ldquo;disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; We need to baptize the Japanese into Christ, the Filipinos into Christ, the Chinese into Christ, and the Indonesians into Christ, that is, into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit&mdash;the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Chinese Union Version translates this verse as, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them <em>in</em> the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Based on this understanding, Christianity carries out an outward work of baptism. For example, if four people believe in the Lord, a pastor will say, &ldquo;Dear church members, praise God for giving us four new members today. We hereby baptize them so that they may join the church. We baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Praise God, they were formerly Gentiles, but now they are church members.&rdquo; Actually, in verse 19, the word <em>in</em> should be translated &ldquo;into.&rdquo; Baptism does not merely involve the repetition of the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; rather, baptism involves putting a believer <em>into</em> the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>There is a story of a Catholic priest who was doing a missionary work in a South American country. One day he preached the gospel to a young native, who then believed. The priest baptized the young native by sprinkling him with water. After baptizing him, the priest changed the young native&rsquo;s name to James. James then nodded and said, &ldquo;Formerly I was So-and-so, but now I am James.&rdquo; Catholicism has a custom that forbids the eating of meat on Friday, but it allows for the eating of fish. One Friday James went hunting in the mountains. When he could not find fish, he shot a deer and brought it back to be cooked and eaten. While he was eating, the priest passed by his window, smelled the aroma, and went in to rebuke him, saying, &ldquo;Do you not know that today is Friday? You cannot eat meat. You should eat fish.&rdquo; James said, &ldquo;Yes, I know, but I could find only this deer. Just as you changed my name after sprinkling water on me, I sprinkled some water on this deer and named it fish. This is no longer a deer but a fish. I am eating fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This story shows that in much of Christianity baptism involves merely an outward act. However, this is not the Lord&rsquo;s view. He charged us to baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, that is, to baptize people into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is unrelated to asking people to join a &ldquo;church.&rdquo; When we preach the gospel and baptize people, I hope we understand that we are not just baptizing them with water but baptizing them into the Triune God. As the Triune God, the Father is the source and the Son is the expression, and when He enters into man, He is realized as the Spirit. When we baptize people, we are not baptizing them into water only but into the Triune God Himself, into the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Hence, baptism is not a practice that makes people members of a &ldquo;church.&rdquo; Rather, it is to put people into the Triune God. Today the Triune God is the Spirit; the Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the realization. He enters into us, and we enter into Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CAUTIOUS OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS AND TONGUES</h2>
<p>Christians today generally lack knowledge and experience of the Spirit. In an incorrect way other Christians pursue so-called spiritual gifts and speaking in tongues. I am not opposed to speaking in tongues, neither am I disregarding the speaking in tongues that is genuine, but I have seen much so-called speaking in tongues that is just <em>&ldquo;di di da da,&rdquo;</em> involving only the speaking of nonsensical sounds. I know what I am speaking about because over thirty years ago in Beijing, I led people to speak in this way. In contrast, on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit who entered into men was full of power, and three thousand were saved. However, we cannot see this kind of result in the Pentecostal movement in Taiwan today. We can see the manifestation of power even less. In recent years the so-called Pentecostal movement on the island of Taiwan was led by a sister. She said that speaking in tongues did not need to be related to a language but merely to sounds from the tongue. Toward the end of her life, she contracted tongue cancer and could not utter any sound. Those around her prophesied that she would be healed and that there would be an unprecedented revival in Taiwan and around the world in 1965 and 1966. But to this day, Taiwan has not witnessed this &ldquo;unprecedented revival,&rdquo; and the sister was not healed. Even after she passed away, her followers prophesied that she would be resurrected, but in the end nothing happened after she was buried. We should be cautious about pursuing spiritual gifts and tongues.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>The Lord created the heavens and the earth. After His work of creation, He became incarnated in the flesh in order to enter into His creature and be united with man. Moreover, in the flesh He accomplished redemption on the cross and then was resurrected from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit. Today creation, incarnation, and redemption have all been accomplished. He is the life-giving Spirit, and when we call upon Him, He enters into us as the Spirit. The Bible says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rdquo; (Rom. 10:13). Salvation is more than having our sins forgiven and not going to hell; salvation is the Lord as the life-giving Spirit entering into us to be joined with us as one. The Lord&rsquo;s Word says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:17). We should all say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, we are one spirit with the Lord!&rdquo; If someone asks us whether we have received the Holy Spirit, we should say, &ldquo;I have not only received the Holy Spirit; I am one spirit with the Lord.&rdquo; This is the meaning of salvation.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on His church and His children to show us that we are one spirit with the Lord. We and the Lord, the Lord and we, have been joined as one spirit. This is too glorious. The Lord is the life-giving Spirit, and He is with our spirit every day. In our spirit, He, as the Spirit, witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. We are in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us. Our spirit and the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit, the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit and our spirit, have been joined as one. Everything depends on the Spirit and our spirit, not on religion, teachings, or gifts, such as tongues.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
