   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WORKING IN THE FATHER S NAME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND WITH THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Son was working in the Father s name John 10:25 and with the Father John 5:17, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means when the Son was working, He was working with the Father as one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He and the Father were not working separately.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 14:10b He said, The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While the Son was speaking, the Father was working.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not two working on the same thing at the same time separately, but two working as one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Son spoke the word, the Father was doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Son s speaking was the Father s working.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>DOING THE FATHER S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord told us in John 6:38 that He came down from heaven not to do His own will, but the will of the Father who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 5:30 He said that He did not seek His own will but the will of the Father who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These words indicate that the Lord as the Son did not carry out His own will but the Father s.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>SPEAKING THE FATHER S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 3:34a; 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:49-50, the Lord made clear to us that when He, as the Son, came He did not speak His own word, but the word of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>SEEKING THE FATHER S GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Son was also seeking the Father s glory John 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Son came in the Father s name, He did the Father s will, He spoke the Father s word, and He sought the Father s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems that the Son had nothing for Himself, but everything for the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then who is He?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the wonderful Son who is the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is the embodiment of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is for the dispensing of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>EXPRESSING THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Son who came in the Father s name, who did the Father s will, who spoke the Father s word, and who sought the Father s glory also expressed the Father John 14:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He only expressed the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was the Son, yet He expressed the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SENDING THE SPIRIT FROM WITH THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the expression of the Father, the Son sent the Spirit from with the Father John 15:26 and note; 16:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why did the Son send the Spirit from with the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the Trinity!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and He sent the Spirit from with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>GIVING THE SPIRIT TO US</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 3:34 tells us that the Son gives the Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After sending the Spirit, the Son gives the Spirit to us without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BECOMING THE SPIRIT THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, through death and resurrection, the Son became the Spirit John 20:19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, the Son sent the Spirit; then He gave the Spirit; and eventually He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the last Adam, He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is for the dispensing of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>ABIDING IN US AS THE SPIRIT WITH THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Finally, the Son is abiding in us as the Spirit with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus said that the Father and He would come to the lover of Him and make their abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that the Father and the Son come together to abide in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By the foregoing verses, verses 16-20, we can see that the Son would ask the Father to give them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When this Spirit of reality would come, He would not only be with the believers, but also in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually the Lord indicated in verse 18 that the coming One, the Spirit of reality, is actually just Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Finally, He said in verse 20, in that day, the day of resurrection, they would know that He was in the Father, and they were in Him, and He was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not only would the Spirit of reality be in them, but even He would be in them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This indicates that He and the Spirit are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then in chapter seventeen in His prayer to the Father, the Lord Jesus said twice, I in them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>23, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is all this?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All this is God the Father dispensing Himself into us through God the Son and in God the Son and by God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>So the entire Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is now abiding in us to be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now in the divine life and in the divine nature He is making us His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As genuine Christians we should live a life that lives the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is not a life that has anything to do with religion or that expresses ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is a life that purely lives the Triune God and expresses Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the dispensing of the Triune God into us to produce many children of God and many brothers of Christ, so that the Father may have a house, that Christ may have a Body, and that the Spirit may have an organism to express the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It has nothing to do with religion, with human ethics, or with man s natural concept and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is altogether the dispensing of the Triune God into us for His expression.</S>
