   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE PROPER PERSON SPECIAL FELLOWSHIP MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:1:30 p.m., December 28, 1947</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Remark:A meeting for those who are burdened for the affairs of God's house, concerning matters related to God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Attendance, about forty or more.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Hsu asked:How should elders serve in the house of God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE PERSON BEING GOD'S METHOD AND WAY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Lee answered:The service of the elders has to do with the person of the elder.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It does not depend on the method, but on the person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Testament it is very difficult to find out what is the method or way to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some places seem to speak about the method or the way, but actually the emphasis is still the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The person is the way, and the person is the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God does not gain a person, He will have no work, and He will have no way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A way is a course that a person takes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If God does not gain man, He will have no course to take.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man thinks that the most important thing to do is to find a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, God's work does not involve giving us the ways, but is a matter of gaining the persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God can gain two or three brothers here, He will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even if I present to you the best way to be an elder, it will be useless if the person is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We, the person, should be gained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to learn to be the proper person more than to learn to do the proper things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is meaningless for things to be done properly without the person being a proper one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What you are is what you do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You cannot serve God beyond what you are as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hudson Taylor said in his book Union and Communion that what we are is more important than what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This word left a deep impression on me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should know how to help the brothers and sisters properly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BEING DEALT WITH BY GOD TO SERVE HIM</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What God cares for is whether or not you have been touched by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The measure we yield ourselves to the Lord determines the measure we are able to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you have been dealt with in your temper, you can help others with their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you have been dealt with in the way you dress, you will be able to help others in the way they dress.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church is not a worldly society.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is a body Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A body is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we can only do the proper things in the church and nothing else, we are failures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is true that we need to learn the proper lessons with regard to many things, including money and the way we deal with our family.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, in the church, business affairs do not take priority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, life takes priority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Life can meet man's present need.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This should cause every servant of God to come before God again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Otherwise, the more right things we do, the more man-made works there are, and the more the church will become a human society or community; it will become something merely human, with nothing other than a common belief and a common philosophy!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>BEING DEALT WITH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>TO BRING IN THE AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to have such a proper life, we need to be restricted in everything and to apply ourselves in a practical way to learn the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The main thing we have to learn is the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A person who has authority has life; he is like the budding rod of Aaron Num 17:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you submit to him, you will have life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you do not submit to him, you will touch death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, such a person does not put on an air.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the apostle spoke about the elders, he spoke very little about what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Mainly he spoke about the kind of persons they should be 1 Tim 3:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In a degraded church, people pay much attention to the office of the elders and the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A person can be very clever and capable, but he may not be dealt with in the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever someone brings his knowledge and diplomacy into the church, it is like putting a hole into a ship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Soon the whole ship will be filled with sea water; the world will invade and take over the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Just because a person has the knowledge does not mean that he can therefore interpret the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When a person engages in visitation work or other affairs, what is needed is not merely to have things done properly, nor to gain others' admiration, but to be a proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A proper person has the authority with him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even if he is not a responsible one, the authority is still with him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Wherever there is life, there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Life is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If God can gain one brother here in an absolute way, the saints in this place will be able to advance in great strides.</S>
