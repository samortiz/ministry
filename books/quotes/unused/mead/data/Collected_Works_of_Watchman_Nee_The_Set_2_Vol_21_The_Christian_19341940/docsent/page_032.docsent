   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIVE PARABLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THINGS NEW AND OLD 2 Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>11 and 12 THE NEW WINE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the difference between the garment and the wine?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And why can new wine not be put in an old wineskin?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Garment refers to the outward work of the gospel; it is something visible to man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Wine refers to the inward work of the gospel; it is something that man does not see.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no difference between the contrast of new and old in the case of the garment and the wine, but the garment is outward, while the wine is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must remember that God's gospel is 1 Christ becoming our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can live before God because of this righteousness, and there is no need to add anything to it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ has accomplished God's righteousness, and even if we try, we cannot add anything to it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anything that we are, or any good work of ours will not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ has pleased God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I am in Christ, God sees me as He sees Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am saved, not because I am different from others, but because I am in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I can present Christ before God and say, "God, I can come to You because I am in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are in Christ, and we have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we can live before God, and God can be pleased with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's gospel is also 2 Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Based upon this, we live before men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Spiritually speaking, we live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Physically speaking, we live in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The garment speaks of the Christ from God who has become our righteousness for us to live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The wine speaks of the Christ from God who has become our power and our spring like the spring inside a clock, which regulates the movement of the clock for us to live before men.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why did the Lord Jesus speak of new wine being put in an old wineskin, instead of an old wine bottle?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Chinese put wine into bottles, but in the Old Testament, wine was put into leather skins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why the Lord did not speak of putting the wine in a bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One cannot put new wine in an old wineskin because new wine ferments, while old wine no longer ferments.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If new wine is put in an old wineskin, the old wineskin will help the new wine to ferment, and it will burst at the force of the fermentation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will cause the wine to spill.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some wonder why the Lord mentioned these few parables the unfulled cloth, the old garment, the new wine, and the old wine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Garment refers to our outward justification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not need to mend the tear of our old conduct; all we have to do is to put on the new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Friends, it was difficult for us to be saved, but living is not as difficult as you may think.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In fact, it is easier than you think.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are saved, and our sins are forgiven, but what are we going to do with the sins that we still commit while living on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please remember that the Lord has not only given you a new garment outside of you, but has put new wine inside of you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only is there a new garment outside to cover you and adorn you, but there is a power within you, a power like the power of the new wine, which bursts apart all the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every time the Bible speaks about salvation, there are two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One is the objective aspect, which is before God, and the other is the subjective aspect, which is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some may not understand the difference between the objective and the subjective side.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I will put it in another way: salvation has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One is justification, and the other is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one can be justified without being regenerated, and no one can be regenerated without being justified.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Justification is before God; it secures a new position for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Regeneration is within us; it secures a new life for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people only pay attention to justification and do not care for regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Others pay too much attention to regeneration and do not care for justification.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some think that regeneration and justification are two different things which are not obtained at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a teaching is a biased teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There must be a balance between justification and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The word "must" appears three times in John 3.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I will mention only two of them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 7 says that one "must" be born anew, and verse 14 says that the Son of Man "must" be lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In both instances the word "must" is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The "must" in verse 14 is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Jesus must be lifted up before man's sins can be forgiven and before man is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The "must" in verse 7 is subjective; it results in us receiving a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One must be justified before he can be free before God, and one must be regenerated before he can have a new life in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Are you afraid of meeting God?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The young ones always say that they are afraid of meeting God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Will God save us, or will He not save us?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Will God say to us, "You workers of iniquity, depart from Me"?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When they come to God, they do not know if God will accept them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many people wonder how they as a sinner can come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When you are in sin and you are swept away by the tide of sin, you do not realize how sinful you are.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But once you stop and consider, you begin to wonder what a person as evil as you should do.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not worry, because the Lord Jesus has come.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He has died for your sins and fulfilled God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is now resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All those who come to God through Jesus Christ will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord said that whoever believes in Him will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul also said that "from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified" Acts 13:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You should know that you can come to God through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Your conscience need not fear, because in Christ there is no longer any condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even though you are saved, you may still feel that you are constantly suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The will to do good is present with you, but the working out is not.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Other believers have experienced changes in their lives, but you do not have the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even though you are just as saved as they are, they experienced these changes, but you have not.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Why is your walk the same as before?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Why is there no change in you?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You may sense your backslidden condition and sinfulness and often weep.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You may think, "I have eternal life, and I am saved, but do I look like a saved person?"</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You can hardly believe that you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As a result, you exert more effort to do good, to pray, to study the Bible, and to control yourself, in order that God will be pleased with you.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But such an effort only works for three to five days.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>After three or five months, it is no longer effective, and in one or two years, its effect will be completely gone.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is what the Lord Jesus meant when He said that we cannot be saved by mending the old garment with new cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In order to be saved, one must put on the new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Even after we are saved, we must continue taking the new wine, which is the power of the new life, before we can overcome all the outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The new wine within us gives us the new life and the power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>All the justified ones are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Those who have the new garment surely have the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But where are you going to put the new wine?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>All those who have the new garment have the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Thank God that He has put in us the regenerated life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>From now on, we are a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The new wine is the power of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We have such a power within us, which enables us to have a new living and to have the power to overcome everything.</S>
