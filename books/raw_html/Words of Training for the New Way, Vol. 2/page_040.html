 <h2 class="head1">LIVING AN OVERCOMING LIFE DAILY</h2>
<p>We who serve the Lord can exhort others to love the Lord, to be spiritual, to study the Bible, to pray, to deny the self, and to reject the flesh, but what is important is whether we ourselves have these experiences, and whether we are such persons. Especially you full-time trainees, you who have given up everything to be for the Lord, should be ones who fellowship with the Lord every day, dealing with Him, living according to the spirit, and having genuine experiences in your daily lives. When you come to the meetings, whether large or small, spontaneously you will be able to release something from within. With either a long message or just a few sentences, you will be able to supply others with what you have received and experienced. This is the meeting that the Bible talks about. Probably, not every saint in the meeting can do this. The church is like a home. There are the old, the young, the sick, and the lame. But I hope that at least one-tenth of those meeting with you can do this. I hope that all the trainees will be such overcomers, not only during the training period but also in the future, wherever you may go. While you are in the training, you should build up such a life. After the training, whether you return to school or to a job, do not forget the training that you have received here but continue to live this kind of life. You are different from others. You are those who live in the spirit. Wherever you meet, you will be able to function properly. Thus, the Lord will have a way to go on.</p>
<p>I hope every one of you can see clearly that you are being trained here not just in methods of the new way: knowing how to preach the gospel or to take care of the home meetings or group meetings. All these are less important; they are not our main emphasis. Our main concern is whether or not we are living in the spirit and living the overcoming life. For this kind of life, first, there is the need to pay a price and to sacrifice oneself to go out regularly according to a schedule to preach the gospel by knocking on doors, to bring people to salvation and reap fruit yearly. I hope that you all are the fourth kind of soil, which is the good earth, growing in life and bearing fruit abundantly. However, you should not despise those who would not do this, and you should not be concerned with those who criticize you. You yourselves must have the determination before the Lord that you will bear fruit in season. Second, you must live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence and speak the Lord&rsquo;s word to people every day. Third, in any meeting, you must follow the Spirit of the Lord to release the riches that you have experienced, realized, and obtained. I hope that all the churches will practice this overcoming way and bring the brothers and sisters into this overcoming way.</p>
