   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE HOW TO CONTACT AND GAIN PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I would like to coach you in how to contact people and gain people for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>LEARNING TO DISCERN PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are contacting people all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are in contact with our relatives, our neighbors, our classmates, and our colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first thing we have to learn in our contact with people is how to discern them, to know them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to discern what kind of character and disposition they have.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We also should know their mood and temperament at the time we are speaking to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to discern whether they are happy or mad.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes people will try to hide their temperament when they talk to you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a person is too mad or too excited, it will be difficult to talk to him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why we need to discern a person s situation when we talk with him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may realize that certain persons are too proud, too much in their mind, too philosophical, or too emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may realize that others have a strong will and that whatever they think cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whatever they say must be followed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our proper discernment of people will help us to reach them and have the proper contact with them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not let people know that we are discerning them, measuring them, and testing them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should simply be with them in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NOT CORRECTING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although we may know someone s character, disposition, and situation, we should never try to correct him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you find out a certain person is emotional with a bad temper, you should be very careful not to touch his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you touch his temper, you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Always say something, do something, and express something to others in a very natural way, without trying to correct them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CONTACTING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition to this, we have to learn how to trust the Lord at the very juncture we are speaking to people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should pray inwardly, Lord, here is this person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lord, what should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While we are praying inwardly, we should simply follow the Lord s leading to speak something in a very natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This kind of contact with people is altogether in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Incarnation is a matter of two natures the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Incarnation means that these two natures come together and are mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we contact people, we must practice the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The principle of the apostles writing of their Epistles was altogether in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans was written in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No doubt, that was a human writing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But this writing was not purely or merely of the man, Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul was writing with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In his Epistles, Paul told us that he was the one writing to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not say, Thus saith the Lord....</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the thinking of the Pentecostal movement according to the Old Testament way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not according to the New Testament principle of incarnation, which we all must practice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why we need much preparation to make ourselves one with the indwelling Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wherever we are and wherever we go, we should be able to say that we are one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever we speak, we should speak in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not speak to others by ourselves, but we should speak together with our indwelling Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is our speaking, yet the Lord speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is according to what the apostle Paul expressed in 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He gave his opinion vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>10, 12, 40 , even though he said he did not have the Lord s commandment v. 25 . Then eventually he said, I think that I also have the Spirit of God v. 40 . This shows that he and God the Spirit spoke together.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should always practice this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Old Testament the word of Jehovah came upon a prophet Jer 1:2; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>1:3 , the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him; thus the two speak together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His word becomes their word, and whatever they utter is His word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF HOW TO CONTACT PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now I would like to mention a few practical points.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In contacting people, we should not start our conversation in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, we should speak in a very common way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Out of our common talk, we can speak something of the Lord to them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One brother told us that he contacted a person on his job who was a young engineer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He read some notes to this young man out of the Recovery Version concerning the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was hoping that this young man would be attracted by the truth in Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But when that young man realized that this brother was meeting in a local church in the Lord s recovery, he became critical.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Also this brother has a neighbor who is a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This pastor also became critical when he found out where this brother was meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When you come across rejecting and criticizing cases like these, you should not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There are many cases like these.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You have to exercise your patience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You should not argue with others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When someone says something in a negative and contending way, it is best to try to turn the subject to something else in order to calm him down and maintain your friendship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You need to look to the Lord for the appropriate time to speak to him about his concerns or misconceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The next time you spend with him may be the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Of course, before that time, you should pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You should pray for the right time to be able to speak to people.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then you can open the talk with them naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If the Lord would arrange for you to have another time with this young engineer, you could change the subject from the genealogy of Christ to the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This young man is a Christian, and he knows today s situation among the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is surely seeking after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Otherwise, he would not be concerned about your situation in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>With such a person, you can share Philippians 1:19.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This verse is a very sweet word concerning the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is a pleasant subject and a sweet item.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You should not talk with him about the genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Instead, you should just speak to him about the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>After another period of time you can share Philippians 1:21a with him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Here Paul said, For to me, to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Paul lived Christ so that he could magnify Christ, whether through life or through death v. 20 . This is another sweet word.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you can speak to him every two or three days and show him many pleasant things from the Scriptures, that young man s heart will be touched and moved.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Through your prayer and speaking, you will win his trust and he might eventually express his concerns to you again about the false rumors he has heard about us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You must learn to be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>You should not respond by merely saying that these things are false and nonsensical.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You could say, We all know the principle of cause and effect.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If there is an effect, there must be some cause.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I have been listening to the ministry in the local churches for a long time, and you know that I am not foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>How could the Lord gain such a result among us with such a rich deposit of the truth?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>What is the cause?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>You should not say anything else to him after this.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He might want you to share more with him, but you should wait for another time to speak more.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We should not be in a hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We should not think that we have to finish our talk to gain a person in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>A good fisher is always very steady.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If a fisherman acts too quickly, he will drive the fish away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>A good fisherman knows that the more the fish bites at the bait, the more it gets caught.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>At another time you may be able to say more.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>You may say, In the past month, I shared with you concerning the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and concerning our living Christ that we might magnify Christ through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I was a Christian for years and I never heard these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I did not realize that these things were in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The more I listened to the ministry in the church, the more truths in the Bible I discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Hundreds of people have had the same experience as I have had.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This is the way to erase the doubts in his mind from the false rumors he has heard.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>In principle you should deal in the same way with the pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He may ask you if you have a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>You may respond by saying that you have many pastors and that you also are a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>You may say, I am working at a job, but I am also a pastor without receiving any pay for it.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Then you may proceed to tell him about the particular new ones or saints whom you have pastored.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>He may go on to ask how your church is organized and how you raise funds for your church and your work.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>You should always exercise to answer him in an interesting way.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Do not be too quick to get people.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Eventually he might ask you if he can come to a meeting, but you should not respond to this until you feel that the time is ripe for him to come.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>When you realize that the time is ripe, you may tell him, Now I will bring you to my meeting, but you have to do me a favor first.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Bring me to your church to see your meeting first.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>It would be best if you could go to his meeting place two or three times before bringing him to our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Then you can see their practices.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>This will prepare you to bring him to our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Then you will know how to share with him and direct him to see some things, and he can have a comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Such a comparison will be helpful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>These are illustrations of how we can care for people in ministering Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We need to apply the principle of incarnation with all the people we contact.</S>
