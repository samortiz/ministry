   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>O brothers and sisters, please remember that every one who believes has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God cannot lie.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What God has said must be.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever you believe, you have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many years ago there was an evangelist, Mr. Chapman, who saved many souls during his preaching and was very well known.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is now with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I mention him because the story of his salvation has something to do with what we are speaking today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was a doctor of philosophy, a highly educated man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once he heard Mr. Moody's preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Mr. Moody was an uneducated laborer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the two conversed with each other, Mr. Moody asked him, "Are you a Christian?" Mr Chapman answered, "Sometimes I am good and sometimes not.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I am zealous I am the most zealous of all men; but when I am cold there is no one colder than I. When I am zealous, I can boldly say that I am a Christian, but when I am cold, I dare not claim that I am a Christian." Mr. Moody did not say anything but asked him to read John 5:24: "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life." After reading the verse, he asked Mr. Chapman, "Are you a saved Christian?" Although Mr. Chapman had a doctorate degree, he responded the same way as that old widow: "I have told you that when I endeavor to do good, I am a Christian, but when I am cold and am not doing good, I am not a Christian." Moody said, "What does this verse say? What do you have after you have heard the gospel and believed in the One that sent Christ, that is, after you have believed in the heavenly Father? Does not the Bible say that this kind of person has eternal life and has passed out of death into life? Mr. Chapman, since you are a believer in the Lord, you are a saved Christian." Mr. Chapman stopped and considered doubtfully.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then he said, "I still cannot say that I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How terrible a person I am!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times I am indeed zealous, but many times I am cold."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moody took the Bible in his hand and said, "Dr. Chapman, whose word is it that you are doubting?" Right then, Mr Chapman realized that he was doubting God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later, he testified in his sermon that from that time on, he knew he had eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For one who believes in the Lord to say that he does not have eternal life is not humility, but unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is to doubt God's words and God's righteous and unchanging character.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone who is in the Lord has eternal life and is not condemned but has passed out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The day when we believe, we are regenerated and have a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I present this matter before everyone, to let you know that you have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Read again John 6:47: "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the whole Bible were taken away and only this verse remained, it would still be sufficient to solve the matter concerning salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Believing is not hoping; it is not waiting for the future, or doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible says, "He who believes has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's Word will not change.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let me tell you another very simple story.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some years ago there was a very well-known servant of the Lord who was also a medical doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He did profound research in the medical field.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition, he had a strong faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At his work, he always exhorted people to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One time he went to a hospital and saw lying in bed a sick young lady, whose life was almost over.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was an aged person, and he went over and asked her, "Are you happy?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She said, "No, I do not have any joy at all."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He asked, "Why are you not happy?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Have you believed in Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She said, "Yes, I have truly believed in Jesus as my Savior, and I have committed all my sins to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He then asked, "Do you have eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Are you saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She said, "This is the very question I cannot resolve.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The doctor said that my temperature is very high and that I do not have long to live.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I still do not know how God will treat me when I see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am very sad and am not happy at all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man has done good all his life, made sacrifices, endeavored to work and save people, and deserved some special merits, he may have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But I do not have many days on earth, and I have not spent much effort to save people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How can I be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The doctor said to her, "Salvation is by the blood of the Lord and the redemption He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have no strength to save ourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He asked her to read John 6:47: "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The doctor then said, "The Lord's word can never be false.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He even says truly, truly,' which means it must be true.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What does He say those who believe in Him will have?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The young lady said, "Eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He asked her again, "Since you have believed, do you have eternal life?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The young lady waited for a long time and then said, "The Bible says that I have eternal life, but I say I do not have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He said, "Which is more reliable, what you say, or what the Bible says?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At last she said with tears on her face, "I believe I have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>From that time on, she became a happy person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Not long afterward, she passed away to the Lord who gave her eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>O friends, I present this matter before you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross in order to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He shed His precious blood to cleanse us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All those who believe in Him will not perish but will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All your problems can be solved here.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today I only ask you, "Do you believe in Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All those who believe have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once I met a sister in Southeast Asia and asked if she believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>She said, "I believe that Jesus can save me."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I asked again, "Are you saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She said, "Sometimes I am saved; sometimes I am not.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When I had a very good time reading the Bible, I considered that it would be wonderful if I would die then, because I believed at that time that I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After a while when I got angry with my mother or quarreled with my younger brother, I felt that I had sinned, and I said to myself that I must not die.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If I died then, I would certainly perish.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Day after day, I switched between moments of good and bad, being saved and not being saved."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I said to her, "Sister, you really must be the most capable person in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Within a day, you can go back and forth between heaven and hell many times.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You are indeed capable.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Who can be as capable as you are?"</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>She said, "Do you mean to say that once I believe, I am a saved person?"</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I said, "What does God say in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God says those who believe have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>No one can alter this Word, not even God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you do not believe this Word, it means you do not believe that the Bible is the Word of God."</S>
