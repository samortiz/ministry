   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Opinions Being Our Greatest Problem</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The greatest problem in the church life is our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our opinions determine whether our meetings are good.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our opinions determine whether our locality is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It may seem that our problems have nothing to do with opinions, but the hidden cause of our problems is opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This word is for the young saints as well as for the elder ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since we love the church and expect our church to be thriving and prosperous, we must bury our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I dare not boast that I do not have opinions, because opinions are hidden deep within us; therefore, we are not conscious of having opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By the Lord s grace, I can testify that on many occasions I have avoided my opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all need to learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>HAVING NO COMPETITION IN THE LORD S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There should not be any competition in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the world everything involves competition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In education, in sports, and in business people compete with others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in the Lord s work, we should not compete.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose a group of three or five saints are laboring at a junior high school and another three are laboring at a different junior high school.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without a doubt there will be competition between the two groups; they will compete and compare results.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>An elder in hall one expects hall one to be the best hall, and an elder in hall two expects hall two to be the best.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A responsible brother from the church in Hong Kong might not say that he desires to make the church in Hong Kong better than the church in Taipei, but he is displeased when the saints praise the church in Taipei and say that the church in Hong Kong is not as advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The saints in Taipei also do not like to hear that the church in Hong Kong is more advanced than the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such situations exist among us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The brothers and sisters in Hong Kong become angry if they hear someone say that the church in Hong Kong is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The saints in Taipei react in the same way if someone says that Taipei is not up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our reactions show that inwardly we are troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The brothers from Taichung will be unhappy if they hear that the church in Taichung is not as good as other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The brothers from Hsinchu will be beside themselves if they hear people say that Hsinchu is the best church in northern Taiwan, but the saints from Taipei will not be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are always competing and striving.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Taipei we are promoting several aspects of the work, including practicing small group meetings, preaching the gospel in the community, preaching the gospel in schools, and carrying out the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, many opinions have surfaced because every aspect of the work is trying to recruit saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, the saints who are leading the small groups are trying to recruit the most capable saints to labor with them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No one is fighting outwardly, but these contentions do exist.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I heard that those who are preaching the gospel in the community are determined to recruit some of the most useful saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Similarly, those who preach the gospel in the schools have identified some saints not to include in their work for fear that they would not contribute much, and thus they would lose the competition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though the saints are serving, this fighting is a common fault in most of us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We like to work with those whom we consider to be experts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because many young full-time brothers will participate in preaching the gospel in the schools, everyone should be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Otherwise, when you begin laboring, you will all fight for workers; you will want the strong saints to join with you, and you will reject the weak ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our hand has five fingers, but not every finger is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not every one of the young full-timers is strong; some of them are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, I am inoculating you beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must not compete with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everyone who competes will not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Competition will not make us rich; it will only cause us to be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a law in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Expecting Others to Be Better Than Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We each need to adopt the attitude that my work is to glorify the Lord and that your work is also to glorify the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whatever work we do is to glorify the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, we should desire rather to see others succeed in their work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must learn and exercise to have such an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If I labor in Taichung, I should hope that the work in Hsinchu will be better than that in Taichung or that the work in Tainan will be better.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose one of my co-workers would be more useful in another place; I would be willing for the Lord to lead accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the attitude we should adopt.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In a large church it is inevitable that some areas of the work overlap or that there is friction because everyone wants the capable saints.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we should try our best to avoid this.</S>
