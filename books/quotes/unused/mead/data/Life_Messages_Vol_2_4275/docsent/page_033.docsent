   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY LIVING BY CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:27; 2:16-17; 3:4, 10-11; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21a THE HEART OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament four may be considered as its heart.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The heart is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may lose a finger or even your nose and still survive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But without your heart you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What books in the New Testament would you say are the most vital?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Over these many years I have worn out several Bibles through using them so much.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even so, the pages of many of the books were not worn out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the pages of four books in those Bibles soon showed signs of wear.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even the Bible I am using now has these same pages well worn.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you check the Bibles of seeking Christians, I believe you will find these very pages also worn.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These books are Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are really the heart of the whole Bible, not just of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their theme is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Galatians reveals that Christ stands in opposition to religion, even the Jewish religion, which was set up according to the commandments and ordinances given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is on one side, and the Jewish religion and its law are on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Surely the Jewish religion was the highest; no heathen religion could compare with it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet Christ stands against it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ versus Greek philosophy is the message of Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Colossians was written, the Mediterranean world was ruled by Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Roman politics and law prevailed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What attracted people of that day were the Jewish religion and Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even in today's modern Western culture, these three components prevail: Roman politics and government, the Hebrew religion, and Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The philosophy dealt with in Colossians was Gnosticism, which included, besides Greek philosophy, elements of Egyptian, Babylonian, and Persian philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Religion and philosophy are culture's highest inventions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without them mankind would be wild, barbaric.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They would be like the Scythians Col 3:11 , who were considered the most barbaric of people, lacking any semblance of religion or philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Human culture rests largely on these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of them the fallen race is kept under constraint and has a good appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But these two books make clear that Christ stands against both religion and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However good these are, they are no match for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is far above them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The message of Philippians is "to me to live is Christ" 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This Christ, who stands in opposition to the highest human attainments, is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are not religious people nor philosophical people; we are Christians, "Christ people."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A Christian has Christ within and lives Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The result of this Christ living in us, opposed to religion and philosophy, is the church, the theme of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is Christ, opposing religion and philosophy, and living out of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Christ within and among His people is God revealed, the heart of the divine revelation.</S>
