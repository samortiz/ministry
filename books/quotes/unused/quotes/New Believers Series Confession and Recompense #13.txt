Once the conscience becomes hardened, a serious and fundamental problem develops: It becomes difficult for God's light to shine into a man
A person must build up a habit of confessing and making recompense so that he can maintain a sensitive and keen conscience before the Lord
There was once a worker of the Lord who used to ask others, 'When was the last time you confessed to someone'?
If it has been a long time since a person's last confession to another person, there has to be some problem with this person's conscience
The length of time since your last confession is an indication of whether or not there is a problem between you and God
How should a person apologize to another person or recompense another person when he offends him or comes short in his dealings with him?
Chapter five tells us that we should confess to God and offer up sacrifices for forgiveness of our miscellaneous sins
Chapter six says that if we have offended anyone in material things, we should take care of the matter with men
A person who has offended anyone or transgressed against anyone in material things has to settle it with men before he can be forgiven
Extorting from one's fellowman: It is a sin to take advantage of anyone through the influence of one's own position and power
To turn something into nothing, to reduce much to little, or to exchange what is bad for what is good is the same as lying
Others have lost something, and you take advantage of them, extorting some gain and benefit out of them; this is sin
Concerning any of the things a man may do to sin thereby' this refers to transgressions against men in terms of material things
God's children should learn and always remember this lesson they should not make the possessions of others their own
The trespass offering in Leviticus 5 deals with sins that do not involve material transgressions against people
He shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more; he shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty'
If the object in question remains in our house, it proves that we are still wrong; we have to return it in full
If we have taken money or things from others, God wants us to add one-fifth to the full amount when we return it
An apology that is in the way of settling accounts is not the kind of confession that God's children should have
If you are concerned about how much each party owes the other when you apologize, you are not behaving like a Christian
When a new believer offends others, he should realize that he will suffer loss eventually, even though he may gain something temporarily
In whatever matter they have transgressed against others, they should return these things to them and ask God for forgiveness
The Lord says, 'Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you'
When you remember something or are reminded of something, do not put the thought aside and think that it is merely a thought
If we have done something wrong or if we have offended or hurt someone, the offended party need not accuse us before God
If we give him or her a reason to sigh, we will lose all our spiritual prospects and all our gifts to God will be annulled
You must 'leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift'
If we offend a brother or a sister, we immediately fall under God's judgment, and it is not easy to be recovered
In verse 25 the Lord emphasized, 'Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way'
Brothers have often regretted that they lost their opportunity to confess to each other; the offended party is no longer on the way
The Lord is not speaking of a future judgment or of being thrown into and being released from an actual prison
His concern is that we would be reconciled today, that we would pay every quadrans today, not putting the matter off until later
Sometimes you have offended one individual, but because you want to testify to the brothers and sisters, you tell them about it
There are of course times when we have to exercise due care in the way we confess we have to take care of the interest and benefit of others
According to this principle, if the recipient of your recompense is no longer available, the recompense should go to his relatives
