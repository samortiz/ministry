   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Son's the Lord's Mingling with His Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 4:5 says, "One Lord, one faith, one baptism."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse shows us the Son's mingling with His Body in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ Being the Element of His Body</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit is the essence of the Body, and Christ is the element of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is a difference between essence and element.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, wood is a kind of substance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This substance is actually an element.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A wooden stand has wood as its substance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wood is the element of the stand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But within this element, there is an essence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This essence is the "spirit" of the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the element, the substance, and the sphere of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Within this Christ there is the Spirit, who is the essence of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can illustrate this matter with a watermelon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The entire melon is the substance of a watermelon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we cut up the melon into slices, we can see the element of the melon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When these slices are pressed, we have melon juice, which is the essence of the melon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the element of the Body of Christ, and the Spirit is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To have only Christ without the Spirit is like having only the melon without the juice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need the melon with the juice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we have the juice, we have the essence of the melon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is the element of His Body, and the Spirit is the essence of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through the One Faith of the Believers,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Which Unites Them with the Son Organically</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we hear the gospel and exercise faith to believe in the Lord, the Spirit enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time, an organic union takes place between us and Christ 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The result is that we become an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why when Christians come together, regardless of their nationality, race, and color, something within them responds to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through faith in Christ, we the believers are organically united with the Son and with one another to become a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through the One Baptism of the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Which Separates the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>from Adam and the Adamic World</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Formerly, we were linked to our old ancestor, Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But through baptism our connection with Adam was cut.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Baptism also cut us away from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After we rise from the water of baptism, our taste for the world is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Formerly, we might have been a person who loved dancing, going to nightclubs, dressing up, and wearing make-up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But through the one baptism, we no longer have a taste for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now we love only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We love to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we go to the meetings, our spirit rejoices and leaps.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Baptism is something we cannot explain, but it is a fact in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we baptize people, we do not need to preach or to explain very much to them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, we need to exercise our spirit and our faith to give others the command to believe in Christ and to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should tell them that it is Christ who has sent us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>While we are speaking in this way, the living Christ who is within us will honor our words.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we say that Confucius or Abraham Lincoln has sent us, no one will respond.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is because these men are dead and buried in tombs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the Christ who has sent us is a living person who has come out of the tomb and is now in resurrection and even in ascension, with all authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we mention His name, He is with us and honors our words.</S>
