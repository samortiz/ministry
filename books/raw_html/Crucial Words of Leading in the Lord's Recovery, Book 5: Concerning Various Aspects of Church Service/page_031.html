	 <h2 class="head2">Being Separate but Administrating Together</h2>
<p>If the twenty-one meeting halls in the church in Taipei were separate from one another, it would not be difficult to administrate and promote the work. However, according to the Bible, even though there are six to seven thousand saints meeting and serving in Taipei, there is only one church. Hence, it is not easy to administrate the church. To administrate each hall separately suggests separation, but to administrate the church centrally without separating the halls makes it difficult to thoroughly care for every area. Therefore, after spending much time before the Lord in consideration, we feel that the Lord has given us a way. Apparently the twenty-one meeting halls are separate in their service and leading, but in principle they are one.</p>
<p>We can use the United States of America as an example. There are fifty states in America. These states are united to establish a federal government. Under the federal government there are state governments. Each state has power to legislate according to the situation and circumstance of that state. However, all legislations need to be under the restriction of the American Constitution. No legislation can override the constitution; otherwise, it contradicts and violates the constitution of the country. A state&rsquo;s violating the constitution is equivalent to the state declaring independence and creating not only two jurisdictions but also two countries. Therefore, every state in America has the right to legislate, but their legislation is restricted by the federal constitution.</p>
<p>When we began the work in Taipei in 1949, we were blessed in our preaching of the gospel and many were saved. Since there was only one meeting hall, which is presently hall one, the problem of being separate but one, or of being one but separate, did not exist. Our preaching of the gospel and our baptizing of people were all conducted in the same place. However, the church has since increased from several hundred to ten thousand. At one time there were even twenty-four thousand in the church. We therefore formed district halls. In every meeting hall there was a service of baptism, but the time of baptism was determined in the elders&rsquo; meeting. This was not very expedient because the elders had to consider the situation of all the meeting halls before a time for baptism could be set. As a result, some saints waited for a long time before being baptized. This shows that it was not very practical to centrally administrate the matter of baptism for all the halls. As a result, we have made some changes. From now on when a meeting hall preaches the gospel and leads people to salvation, it can baptize them without asking for a decision from the elders&rsquo; meeting. However, after the baptism the meeting hall must give the baptismal information to the business office for their records.</p>
<p>This kind of administration is not a separation. For two thousand years, Christians have debated whether baptism should be by sprinkling or by immersion. In the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we accepted the truth of baptism by immersion; this is the light we saw from the Bible. Consequently, it would be wrong for a meeting hall to say, &ldquo;It is not convenient for us to baptize people by immersion, because we do not have a baptismal tub. We will now baptize people by sprinkling.&rdquo; Such a decision would violate the constitution and would result in a division in the church. There would be a baptism-by-immersion church and a baptism-by-sprinkling church. This is wrong. Each meeting hall can decide when and where to baptize people, but it has no ground to change the truth concerning baptism by immersion.</p>
<p>This example shows that in some matters we can separate administrative practices for the sake of convenience and effectiveness, but we cannot separate ourselves in the truth. This keeps the oneness. It is not necessary to require that all twenty-one districts be uniform in every administrative detail, because of differences due to geography, environment, and time. If we demand uniformity in all things, we will take care of one aspect and miss the other. This will frustrate the administration and promotion of the work. Therefore, for the sake of administrating and promoting the work, we can be separate while administrating as one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Every Meeting Hall Having Elders</h2>
<p>In the way of our practice, every district will have two or three elders. After careful consideration and thorough fellowship and prayer, we decided to select forty-six elders from among the leading brothers and place them in the twenty-one meeting halls. Most of the current elders are older; the youngest one is fifty-five years old. When a person becomes sixty-five years of age, he feels a lack in his physical abilities. It may be possible for older brothers to take the lead in a smaller church with seventy to eighty saints, but in a church as large as Taipei, which has twenty-one meeting halls and many saints in each meeting hall, the older brothers are bound to feel a lack in their physical ability even though they have insight and experience.</p>
<p>The elders appointed to be responsible for administration and promoting the work in the twenty-one meeting halls must be between the ages of thirty and fifty. They will promote and carry out the work and bring others with them into the work. They must be able to consider things and to come up with ideas. Even if a big mountain is blocking the way, they must be able to cut a hole through the mountain. These new elders must have such a spirit in order for the church to have a breakthrough and to propagate.</p>
<p>It is good for a church to have a large number of saints. However, in terms of promoting the work, it is very difficult to mobilize a large group of saints. Sometimes a large number of saints can be a hindrance. There is no need to administrate a locality with only seven or eight saints. The churches in various places can confirm this fact: when the number in a church reaches one hundred saints, the increase slows down. Much effort is required to increase from one hundred saints to one hundred twenty, and it is even more difficult to reach two hundred saints. This can be compared to the difference between pushing a bicycle uphill and pushing a car uphill. It is much easier to push a bicycle.</p>
<p>Today the church in Taipei is a large church, and it is not easy to move the church. The number of saints in the meetings has not changed much. For the past twenty-eight years, there has not been a significant change in the number of saints in the meetings because this car is too big to be pushed. Therefore, we are determined to have a breakthrough. We would like to include some younger saints to promote the work in every meeting hall. We are determined to push this car. When we are able to push this car, we will say Hallelujah!</p>
