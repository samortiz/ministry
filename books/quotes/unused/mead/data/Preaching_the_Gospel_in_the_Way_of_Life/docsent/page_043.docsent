   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR LABOR BEING NOT A HEAVY BURDEN BUT OUR NORMAL DUTY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are limited by time because we are not full-time workers in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, if we practice to find the proper way, we can improve our way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope we all would learn the best way, not to be too heavily burdened with the work, but to do our work as a duty.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are living here for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if we do not have the time every day, we can separate some time at least once a week for the work of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you do a little, I do a little, and every member of the church does a little, we can put all these little portions together into something significant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, we must do this for the long run, not just once for all or even once a year, but as a regular duty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If this responsibility is too much for a few brothers, then in fellowship more brothers can be brought in to help.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All things can be very flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there are thirty-five new ones, the brothers and sisters can divide into two groups; one can work on seventeen, and the other will work on the other eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord's yoke is not hard, and His burden is not heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord has no intention to overwork us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Still, we must look to the Lord for the patience to learn these things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The proper church life is just like a family life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot build up a family in a miraculous or special way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to build up a family in a very normal and ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This requires our time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It takes at least twenty years for our children to grow up as mature men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church life is the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if today we have some miracles in the gospel, I would like to quench them a little.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brothers who were with me in Taiwan can testify that several times after I returned there, I poured cold water on their work if it was done in a miraculous or extraordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because I know the danger.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you drive a car eighty miles an hour, I will ask you to slow down a little.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is better to drive thirty or forty miles an hour in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Recently the son of a co-worker in Taiwan wrote to tell us about the many miracles and healings there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He even laid hands on others, and people were healed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After I read that, I felt to write something to quench his fire a little.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I want to help people to take proper food in a normal daily way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not eat strange and special foods.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simply eat the normal food; then your family will be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Dear brothers, I ask you in the Lord's mercy and by His grace to learn a little patience and go on in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not expect too much; simply go on little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then in the long run you will see what the result will be.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have no intention to ask you to overwork.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I simply have the desire to see that you all learn how to serve the Lord in a proper, normal way, in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are living here for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As to what we have, we simply spend what we can, and as to what we are, we are willing to be spent for the gospel's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please do your best to work, pray, coordinate, and cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then this "machine" will keep going on and on.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the long run we will baptize many new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not too much.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Monthly we can have a preaching meeting to help us, and we can all live for the gospel and work in a proper way for the long run.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a lifelong matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Gradually, monthly, some new ones will be added into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is just a part of our training.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After people are baptized, there is another section of the work that we must care for.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Bringing people in is just the beginning, the first part, of gospel preaching.</S>
