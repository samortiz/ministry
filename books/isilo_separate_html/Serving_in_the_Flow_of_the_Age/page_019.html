<p>Moreover, although it is good to exercise to call on the name of the Lord loudly, it is not necessary to be loud every time. Sometimes we do not need to be loud in order to release our spirit. In addition, we need to care for our surroundings. For example, it is not fitting to loudly call on the name of the Lord in the morning if it disturbs others. We should not emphasize only one aspect of any matter. On the one hand, it is too much if someone says, &ldquo;I do not care about anything; I just want to call loudly.&rdquo; On the other hand, if someone says that we should not call on the name of the Lord at all, this is too much as well. In everything we should be moderate. If we do not eat, we will starve to death, and if we do not restrain our eating, we will stuff ourselves to death. Neither is good. It is best to eat set portions three times a day with two snacks at most. Thus, we should focus on eating in a healthy way.</p>
<p>We must learn to be moderate in all things. When we mention calling on the name of the Lord and exercising our spirit in the meetings, the older ones say, &ldquo;The young people are noisy; we cannot stand this.&rdquo; In this case it would be good if the older ones would call loudly, but they do not. In contrast, the young people say, &ldquo;The older ones are too quiet; we cannot stand this.&rdquo; In this case it would be good if the younger ones did not call so loudly. When we exercise our spirit, we often disregard the truth, but when we pay attention to truth, we often disregard our spirit. We do not know how to be moderate. We should never be too strong in any matter; otherwise, it will not last long. Any calling that is based only on being loud will be short-lived; however, if there is no calling, the result will be death. Our exercise must be moderate and fitting in order for us to be continually living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seizing the Opportunity to Supply Spirit and Life</h2>
<p>This does not mean that we should not have certain activities in the meeting but that the activities must be moderate, fitting, strong in spirit, rich, and fresh. If the elders have arranged for brothers to give a message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, the young people should not oppose this. The young people can seize the opportunity to pray short prayers one after another, each with a strong spirit and in a rich and fresh way. Then the meeting will be uplifted to the heavens. After these prayers the brothers can give a message, and there will be no conflict.</p>
<p>Perhaps the elders have other arrangements, such as having a brother stand up to choose a hymn. The young people should not oppose this either. After everyone has finished singing, the young people can pray. After several pray, I do not believe that anyone will feel that their prayers were a distraction; rather, the saints will feel fresh, living, and supplied. Even after the message is over, the young people can seize the opportunity to share, one after another, for half a minute or twenty seconds with a strong and rich spirit. As a result, some may say, &ldquo;I did not get much from listening to the forty-five-minute message, but the last five minutes truly supplied me.&rdquo; There is no need to oppose anything that is old. If we exercise in this way for several months, those who are used to listening to messages will say, &ldquo;We would like the young people to have an opportunity to pray more. Can the messages be shortened to allow for at least twenty minutes for the young people to share?&rdquo; This is life swallowing up death.</p>
<p>This also applies to the prayer meeting. If the meeting starts at seven thirty, the young people should be there by quarter to seven. When they get to the meeting, they should start praying in a proper, rich, and spiritual way, not in a loud way. In this way, calling hymns and making announcements will not become distractions, and there will be no quarreling and disputes. There will only be a display of &ldquo;diamonds.&rdquo; One prayer after another will be a &ldquo;diamond.&rdquo; There also will be no contention in the meeting, and the atmosphere of the meeting will change. Then the saints, like a skilled basketball team, will learn to never drop the ball. We must change the atmosphere of every meeting by exercising our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Changing Others but Supplying Life in Spirit</h2>
<p>When some co-workers arrive at a meeting, they sit on &ldquo;invisible thrones,&rdquo; and their actions indicate that the elders must submit to them. They may not say this, but this is their intention. Such an attitude is unbefitting. This has not been my attitude in serving in Taipei over the past ten years. We need to change our attitude and lead the church with our spirit; then people will spontaneously follow. If we seat ourselves on &ldquo;invisible thrones&rdquo; and display &ldquo;glass beads&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;diamonds,&rdquo; the saints may tolerate us for a short time but not for very long. When a co-worker goes to a place, he should not sit on an &ldquo;invisible throne&rdquo; or try to change people. He should only supply life in spirit.</p>
<p>If an arrangement is made for me to go to a certain place, I will go with a burden. However, when I arrive, I will not call a meeting. I will attend their meeting first. I will meet in whatever way they meet. If they meet in the morning, I will go; if they meet in the evening, I will still go. I will attend all their meetings and not have any conflict with anyone in the meetings. Nevertheless, whenever the opportunity arises, I will display a &ldquo;diamond.&rdquo; We should not make changes; we should only display &ldquo;diamonds.&rdquo; Outward changes are of no use; the issue is whether or not we are displaying the &ldquo;diamonds.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
