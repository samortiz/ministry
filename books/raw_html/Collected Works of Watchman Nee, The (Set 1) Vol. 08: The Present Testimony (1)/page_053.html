<H1 CLASS=TITLE>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(By Ruth Lee)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 17</H2><P>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>By the grace of God, we are sending out this issue of The Present Testimony. We humbly pray that God will use His truth to edify both you and us. Many times we err in our way because we only know part of God's truth without knowing the rest. Many times we grope in darkness and do not find a way out because we lack the enlightening and leading of the truth. The message in this issue will free us from our burden and also cause us not to relax.</P><P>For the most part, our work goes on as usual. Although we have seen much need in the church of God, we are not yet made ready by Him. If we do not have God's explicit command, how can we dare act presumptuously? We request that all the brothers and sisters who have placed hope in us would pray much for us, so that the portion of the work that God has assigned to us will not be delayed by us.</P><P>Recently in our meeting place at 212 Wen-deh Lane, Hardoon Road, some brothers have risen up to preach the gospel every Lord's Day afternoon at half-past three. Readers who live near Shanghai can bring unbelievers to come and hear the gospel.</P><P>We still have to say a few words about our brother Watchman Nee. For the past few years, he has been strenuously working. Although some do not realize how weak his body is, we, his co-workers, realize that he really needs the rest. For this reason, when friends sometimes come to visit him, we have to reluctantly stop them from seeing our brother. At present there are many letters which he cannot personally answer, and there are many questions which he cannot answer. We ask the brothers and sisters who love our brother to forgive him and us in these matters. Our greatest hope is that the prayers of many will cause his health to be recovered soon, and that he will not disappoint the earnest hope of many brothers and sisters. May God bless you!</P><P>Shanghai,<br>October 14, 1930</P>
