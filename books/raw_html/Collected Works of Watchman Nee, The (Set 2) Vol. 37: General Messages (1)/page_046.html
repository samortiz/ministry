<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 8:32</h1><p>Nineteen hundred years ago, Pilate asked, "What is truth?" (John 18:38). Many people have also asked this question. We cannot explain the biblical meaning of truth according to our concept. We have to consider what truth is according to God's Word.</p><p>The word truth in Greek means "absolute reality." Hence, truth is not a theory but a reality. We do not know the theory behind many real things, yet we can touch the fact and the reality of them.</p><p>According to John 1:17, the law was given through Moses, while grace and reality came by Jesus Christ. Grace is not an attitude of God, but a work of God. Grace is the work that Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, has accomplished for us. God's Son has been crucified on the cross and shed His blood to accomplish God's work of redemption. There is no need for us to do anything by ourselves. By trusting in Him, we are saved. Without the work of the cross, God had no way to dispense His grace to man. Through Moses, He was only able to give man the law. Grace comes to us only because of the work of the cross. Therefore, grace is the work of God. Both grace and reality are in the same verse. Grace came through Jesus Christ, and reality also came through Jesus Christ. When God gave the world His only begotten Son, He intended that He be reality as much as grace. Through the work of His Son, there was grace. Through the work of His Son, there was also reality. Without the work of the Lord Jesus, there could not be grace today. The Lord Jesus had to accomplish grace before this grace could be dispensed to man; millions of Christians believe this. The Lord Jesus also had to accomplish the reality before this reality could be dispensed to man. Ephesians 4:21 says, "The reality is in Jesus." God has accomplished the truth in the Lord Jesus. The truth is in Him; it is His work.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said, "I am...the reality" (John 14:6). The truth mentioned in the Bible refers to nothing other than the reality. What is reality? It is what we really are before God as a result of the Lord Jesus' accomplished work. This is truth, and this is reality. The Lord Jesus has shed His blood to redeem all those who belong to Him. This is a fact. Because of Him, I am a redeemed person before the Lord. This is the truth. The truth is what I am as a result of the facts accomplished in the Lord Jesus. I can only have the truth through the work that the Lord Jesus has accomplished. If the Lord Jesus had not worked, I would not have any truth or any reality before the Lord. I was a dead man and a sinner before God; I did not have any standing or anything before Him. But now, thank the Lord, through the work of the Lord Jesus, I have the reality before God; I have gained something solid and real. This real and solid thing is the fact that I am now a redeemed person. We must remember that the truth mentioned in the Bible is not doctrines preached on a platform, but a fact before the Lord. A doctrine is man's explanation of something, while the truth is what we have become in the eyes of God through the accomplishments of the Lord Jesus. Through the work of the Lord Jesus, God has made me another person. This is a truth; it is a reality. We must remember that in God's eyes, the work of Jesus Christ is finished. The truth is what we have become as a result of this work. Truth is Christ; it is the Lord Jesus Himself because all the realities are in Christ. All the facts that we have been speaking of are in Christ. We can say that two plus two equaling four is a truth, but it is not the truth that we are speaking of here. The truth that we are speaking of here is just Christ Himself.</p>
