   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. For the Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Building of God s Dwelling Place</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Revelation 2:17, the hidden manna is for the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The open manna was for the enjoyment of the Lord s people in a public way; the hidden manna is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers who overcome the degradation of the worldly church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every proper priest is an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that it is impossible for you to be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You can become an overcomer by enjoying Christ as manna.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eat the open manna, and Christ will become the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This hidden manna will constitute you into an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It will also fulfill the requirements of the inner law of life and bring you into peace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, you will be an overcomer according to Revelation 2:17.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the Old Testament, the children of Israel ate manna in the wilderness for a period of forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But sixteen hundred years later the Lord Jesus spoke to the church in Pergamos, and to all the seven churches in Asia, concerning the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After all these centuries, the Lord brought His people back to manna.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s intention is that all the churches eat the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, in the churches we should not eat simply the open manna, but should also eat the hidden manna, which makes us priests and overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By eating the hidden manna we shall receive a white stone Rev 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Bible a stone signifies building material.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we eat of the hidden manna, we shall become priests and overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, the hidden manna will transform us into stones for the building of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In ancient times the eating of manna was related to the building of the tabernacle as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today the eating of Christ as the hidden manna is also related to the building of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible consistently reveals that eating manna is for the building up of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our understanding of the hidden manna is limited by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I cannot minister more regarding this than I have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At least we have seen that today we are eating Christ and preserving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Simultaneously, He is transforming us into priests and overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is also making us white stones for the building of God s dwelling place in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians today are seeking miracles without realizing that all these points related to manna are genuine miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While many seek superficial miracles, we enjoy the deeper miracles found in manna.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Day by day we are eating Christ and enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Is this not a miracle?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the eating of manna by the children of Israel was a miracle, surely our eating of Christ today is also a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regarding manna, there is miracle upon miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even the amount of our daily portion of manna is miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No matter how diligent, or even greedy, we may be in gathering manna, we eventually end up with just one omer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Realizing this will cause us to be at peace and to live one day at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not try to save up manna for tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, live by the Lord s miraculous provision today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What you enjoy of Christ will be what is preserved with Christ in the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This takes place altogether in our spirit and is related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Christ we enjoy in the church is hidden in God and preserved in the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The measure of Christ we preserve in the golden pot is in the ark and corresponds to God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All this is in the Holy of Holies, which is in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who are greedy may try to store up manna for tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the manna you save in this way will not feed you the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, it will breed worms.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is strange, however, that the omer of manna preserved in the golden pot does not spoil or become rotten.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It remains forever.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 16:21 we are also told that when the sun became hot, the manna melted.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, manna could be ground, beaten, and boiled.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the other hand, it melted when left out in the hot sun.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the omer of manna preserved in the golden pot did not melt.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a further indication of the miraculous nature of the provision of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s intention is to give each of us an omer of manna, whether we collect more or less.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The amount of manna we receive depends on God, not on us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The measure is in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, in the eating of manna, we eventually are able to eat just one omer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This indicates that the amount of manna we eat is not according to our appetite, but according to the Lord s arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When some hear that the gathering and eating of manna are according to God, not according to us, they may say, There is no reason for us to go out to gather manna.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whether we gather it or not, the Lord will have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, if this is our attitude, the Lord will not have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must do our part to gather manna.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All the rest is up to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No matter how much we collect, we shall receive one omer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Likewise, no matter how much we can eat, we shall eventually take in just one omer.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not think that by eating greedily you can partake of more manna.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All the different aspects of manna are miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The whole story of God s sending the manna is a miracle that cannot be explained by our natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On the sixth day the children of Israel collected a double portion in order to have a supply for the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In this case the extra portion did not breed worms.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Surely this is according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Furthermore, we have seen that the manna in the golden pot did not spoil or melt.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This reveals that the experience of manna is not according to man s regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God is the One who determines how manna should be gathered, eaten, and preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we try to store up manna, it will breed worms.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But if God tells us to collect a portion for two days, the manna will remain fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then if God requires us to preserve an omer in a golden pot, that portion of manna will remain forever.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Concerning manna, the regulations are not according to our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ is not according to man s way or estimation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Our enjoyment of Christ must be according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The way to enjoy Christ wholly depends on God s regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Although we cannot fully express this in words, we can appreciate it according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We may be greedy even in our seeking after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is especially true of young people, who do not like to be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Nevertheless, the greedy ones need to be scaled down by God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We may collect a great deal of manna, but God will regulate us and reduce us to the proper measure.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This does not imply, however, that we should be lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Furthermore, we should not try to balance ourselves or measure ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should simply allow the heavenly measure to balance us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>No matter how greedy we may be in gathering manna, eventually we shall be the same as others, and we shall not receive more than they receive.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It does not work to try to adjust ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The greedy ones will never be lazy, and the lazy ones will never be greedy.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To try to change ourselves is just religious endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We should simply seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>What we receive of Him will be a miracle according to His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>No matter how much manna we may collect, after the manna has been measured out, we each shall have one omer.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When they hear that whether we gather more or less we shall each receive an omer of manna, some may say, Then we should not try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If it is possible for you to cease all that you are doing, I encourage you to stop your activity.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Actually, however, everything depends on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The point regarding the fact that God balances us may not be clear to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Manna itself is a miracle, and the dealing with manna is also a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Everything related to manna is miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The way it was sent was miraculous, and the way of balancing according to the heavenly measure is also miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is difficult for us to understand why after collecting so much manna we still receive just one omer.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In the same principle, it is also difficult to understand why those who collect less than an omer also receive one omer.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>All this is miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The Bible does not tell us that manna melted after the children of Israel brought it back to their tents.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>However, if it was left in the open air, it melted when the sun became hot.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Perhaps the temperature in the tents was higher than the temperature outside.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Nevertheless, the manna melted when left in the open air, but it did not melt in the tents of the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This shows that the whole experience of manna is not according to the natural or scientific concept.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Furthermore, it is not according to man s arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The children of Israel had to collect, enjoy, and keep manna according to God and according to His regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The same is true of us with respect to the experience of Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We have seen that the manna preserved in the golden pot remained for generations without spoiling or melting.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The principle here, as with everything else related to manna, is that manna was a miraculous provision from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This miracle, moreover, was not short-lived.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The sending of manna was a long-term miracle which continued for about forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Morning after morning, the manna came in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>No matter where the children of Israel were in their travels, manna came each morning.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The sending of manna was not confined to a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Although the manna in the wilderness was a long-lasting miracle, it was not as lasting as Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>As our food, Christ will last for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Partaking of Christ is a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>It is not according to the natural concept, and it cannot be understood by scientific investigation.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>If you do not believe that partaking of Christ is a miracle, I would ask you why among the vast number of today s Christians you hunger after Christ and so many others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Is this not a miracle?</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Why do you partake of Christ when others have no appetite for Him?</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Among children in the same family, some have a heart for Christ and others are indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>A group of Christians may hear the same messages and receive the same spiritual truth, but some seek the Lord and others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>This is a further indication that our partaking of Christ is miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The tabernacle in the Old Testament portrays spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>In the tabernacle there was the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Within the Holy of Holies was the ark, and in the ark was a golden pot containing manna.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>All this is a picture of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>In the Holy of Holies, our spirit, we have Christ, the ark of God.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Within Christ there is the golden pot, the divine nature, preserving the Christ we have enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>This picture reveals that the hidden manna is preserved in the depths of our being, in the Christ hidden and held in the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>This hidden and preserved Christ will be a memorial for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>If we are asked where the hidden manna is today, we should not simply say that it is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>We must go on to say that the hidden manna is in the golden pot, that the golden pot is in the ark, and that the ark is in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>This is a picture of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>The Bible is a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>After the children of Israel had begun to eat manna, God commanded them to preserve an omer of manna in a golden pot and to place this pot in the ark of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>God s intention here is to portray our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Certain Christian teachers do not interpret the picture this way because their view of things is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>According to their interpretation, the Holy of Holies refers to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>If their interpretation is accurate, then the golden pot containing the hidden manna is far away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>This interpretation covers only the heavenly aspect, not the aspect of spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>To care for the aspect of experience, we need to interpret the picture in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>According to this point of view, the Holy of Holies refers to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Where is the hidden manna today?</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>It is in the divine nature within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>If we have the genuine experience of Christ, we shall appreciate Christ and enjoy Him in the divine nature within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>We today are God s tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>As the tabernacle, we have the ark, Christ, in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>We have pointed out again and again that the golden pot is in the ark and that the manna is in the golden pot.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>In our experience we enjoy three precious things: the ark, the golden pot, and the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>How subjective is Christ as the hidden manna!</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>He is the manna we have taken in and enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>This manna will be preserved as a memorial for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>What you enjoy of Christ will be preserved in the divine nature for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>I believe that when we enter into eternity we shall become more clear concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>The picture of the preserving of the manna in the golden pot is related to our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>Because many Christians do not grasp the significance of this picture, they only realize that manna is good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>They have no idea that the manna we enjoy is to be preserved as a memorial in the divine nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>We thank the Lord for the picture at the end of Exodus 16.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>This picture portrays the experience of Christ as manna.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>If we eat Christ as manna, the manna we eat will be preserved in the divine nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>This hidden manna is a memorial of Christ as the supply to God s people for the building of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>Such a memorial will be a remembrance for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Everything else may change, but our experience of Christ will remain for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>What we enjoy of Christ today will become a memorial in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>Whatever we eat of Him will be preserved in the divine nature as an eternal memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>This is the significance of the picture at the end of chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>We should not follow those Bible teachers who interpret this picture only in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>We need to understand this picture in a subjective way according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>If we view the portrait of the preserving of manna in this way, we shall see that we are the tabernacle and that the contents of the tabernacle are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>The ark and the testimony, the law of life, are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>Furthermore the golden pot with the manna is in us as a memorial for eternity.</S>
