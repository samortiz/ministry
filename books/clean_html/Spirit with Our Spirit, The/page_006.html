<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. With a Spirit Produced of the Breath of God<br>(the Same Hebrew Word for "Breath" in Genesis 2:7<br>Is Translated into "Spirit" in Proverbs 20:27),<br>as Man's Inmost Organ</H2><P>Man was created by God with a spirit produced of the breath of God, as man's inmost organ. I use the word produced here because the origin of our spirit is the breath of life. The Hebrew word for "breath" in Genesis 2:7 and for "spirit" in Proverbs 20:27 is not ruach but neshamah. Proverbs 20:27 says, "The spirit [neshamah] of man is the lamp of Jehovah" (ASV). Our body is the frame and this frame has an organ, our spirit. This is the highest organ within us and is mainly for us to contact God. John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and they who worship Him must worship in spirit. We must worship God in our spirit as an organ to contact Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. With a Soul, the Issue of God's Breath<br>Breathed into the Nostrils of the Body Formed of Dust,<br>as Man's Inner Being (Person)</H2><P>When God's breath was breathed into the nostrils of man's body formed of dust, there was an issue. This issue was the soul of man as man's inner being (person). We have only one person, and our person is the soul. There are a number of times when the Bible says "souls" when speaking of persons. Exodus 1:5 speaks of the seventy souls that came out of Jacob. These were the seventy persons of the house of Jacob who went down to Egypt. The New Testament also refers to persons as souls (Acts 27:37). Our soul is our person. The outer frame is our body, the inner being is our soul, and the inmost organ is our spirit. You have a frame, you are a person, and this person in the frame has an organ, which is mostly for contacting God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Spirit of Man Was Created by God,<br>in a Particular Sense, to Complete God's Purpose in the Creation of the Heavens and the Earth</H2><P>The spirit of man was created by God, in a particular sense, to complete God's purpose in the creation of the heavens and the earth (Zech. 12:1; Isa. 42:5; Job 32:8). Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. Zechariah put these three things together: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God. Thus, man is the center of God's creation, and the center of man is his spirit.</P><P>Without the heavens to give sunshine, air, and rain, the earth could not grow anything, and we could not live. All the living things&#151; plants, animals, and man&#151;need sunshine, air, and rain. Otherwise, they will die. Thus, the heavens are for the earth. Also, the earth was created for the existence of man, and man has a spirit within him to contain God. We are living on the earth with the supply from the heavens for the purpose of being one with God. God created an organ within us for this purpose.</P><P>The record in Genesis 1 and 2 tells us about God's creation. It says God created the heavens and then the earth with the plant life and animal life. But when the record comes to the creation of man, it gives us a particular point. This point is that within man, God created a spirit out of His breath of life. This is something particular in the completion of God's purpose in the creation of the heavens and the earth. God created the heavens and the earth because He wants to have man as His expression. In order for man to be God's expression, this man needs a spirit to contact God and to contain God. God created the heavens for the earth, God created the earth for man, and God created a spirit for man so that man can contact Him to be one with Him organically.</P>
