   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the previous messages, we have seen the definition of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to help us see the truth concerning the Spirit in a full way, I would encourage us to read and even to study a small booklet we have published entitled The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This booklet is a reprint of chapter five of Andrew Murray's book The Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Andrew Murray points out that today's Spirit has not only the divine element but also the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is an extraordinary revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Spirit there are also the elements of Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today the Spirit is not only the Spirit of divinity but also the Spirit of Christ's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1971 we gave a number of messages on the significance of the meal offering in the book of Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In those messages we stressed that the meal offering refers to Christ's humanity see the book entitled Christ as the Reality .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In those messages we coined a new term by saying that we should be "Jesusly human."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In resurrection Christ, who was the only begotten Son of God in His divinity, was born of God in His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29; 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His humanity was "sonized," made divine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This "sonizing" in resurrection sanctified, uplifted, and transformed Christ's humanity which He put on in incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today such an uplifted humanity is in the Spirit and can be our enjoyment in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that we could spend some time to study the previous messages we have released concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our understanding and apprehension of the Spirit are limited, we will not enjoy the Spirit as much as we should.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our learning and our study of the divine revelation will help us to participate in, to enjoy, the all-inclusive compounded Spirit, in whom we have Christ's divinity, Christ's humanity, Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Andrew Murray said that the humanity of Jesus has been interwoven into His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He used the word interwoven, as in a textile.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We use the word mingled, as in the mingling of the fine flour with oil in the meal offering Lev 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our study of the Spirit of God in the previous outlines and messages was simple, but I believe it was all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those outlines and messages are the produce, the abstract, and the crystallization of the proper understanding of the Spirit of God according to the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without such a Spirit, the humanity of Christ uplifted through resurrection could not be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the Spirit is the instrument which conveys all the elements of Christ's person and Christ's work into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ's divinity, His humanity, His death with its effectiveness, and His resurrection with its power remain in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But due to our lack of the proper understanding, we do not know how to enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is like having groceries without knowing how to cook them so that we can eat them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to see that today all the elements of Christ's person and work can be our enjoyment in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now that we have seen the definition of the Spirit, we want to see the definition of our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This definition is very simple, but we should not minimize it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is very simple yet very vital and crucial in the divine and spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is strongly and emphatically taught by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible also strongly stresses and teaches us concerning the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a big "missing" in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They miss the human spirit even more than they miss the proper understanding of the Spirit of God.</S>
