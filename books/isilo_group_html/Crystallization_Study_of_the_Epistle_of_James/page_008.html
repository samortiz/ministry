THE ITEMS LISTED ABOVE IMPLY:</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Factors of Which the Christian Perfection<br>Stressed by James Is Produced</H2><P>Now we want to see the seven factors of which the Christian perfection stressed by James is brought forth, or produced.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. All Good Giving and Every Perfect Gift</H2><P>The first factor is the giving and gifts by God to His people (James 1:17a, 5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Begetting by God, the Father of Lights,<br>to Be the Firstfruits of His Creatures</H2><P>The second factor is our being begotten by God, the Father of lights, to be the firstfruits of His creatures (James 1:17b-18). This is God's regeneration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Word of Truth</H2><P>Another factor of the Christian perfection which James stresses is the word of truth (1:18). Psalm 119 refers to the law as the word of truth (v. 43). The law is the word of God, and the word is the truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Implanted Word</H2><P>James also speaks of the implanted word (1:21). This is also a reference to the word of the law.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Scripture</H2><P>In 2:8 James speaks of the royal law according to the Scripture. I believe that James trusted in the Old Testament Scriptures very much. The Old Testament was a major factor of Christian perfection stressed by James.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Indwelling Spirit of God</H2><P>The top factor stressed by James is the indwelling Spirit of God (4:5).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Epistle of James &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
