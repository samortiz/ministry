Man was the very center of God's desire, made to express Him. Yet because of man's sin, God's righteousness required man to be condemned. In this lesson we will see that God's solution to His dilemma is marvelously perfect and complete. The Lord Jesus is the unique Person who was qualified to die for our redemption.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. DIED AS A MAN</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Acquired Man's Blood</H2><P>All men have sinned and the wages of sin is death (Rom. 3:23; 6:23). For man's sin, God required the payment of man's blood. Hebrews 9:22 says, "Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." This is why the Lord Jesus had to become a man. Man's blood was required, so God had to acquire such blood. God had no blood; but by His incarnation, He took on blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14). As the man Jesus, He could shed genuine human blood for our sake.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Was Without Sin</H2><P>God had to become not just a man, but a sinless man. If Jesus had even one sin, He could never die for others' sins because He would have to die for His own. Therefore Christ knew no sin (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). He was made only in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). He was without spot or blemish (1 Pet. 1:19). From this we see that Christ was fully qualified to die for man. He could shed human blood and He could die for others because He had no sin.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 2: The Triune God-The Triune God and the Person and Work of Christ &nbsp; pg 41</div><br></body></html>
