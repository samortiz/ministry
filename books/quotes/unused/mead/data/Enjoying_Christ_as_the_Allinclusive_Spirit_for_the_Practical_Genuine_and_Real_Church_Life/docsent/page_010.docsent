   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLESSING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit is ministered to us through the death of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ died on the cross in order that we may receive the blessing of Abraham, the bountiful Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The greatest blessing is not to receive a high degree, or to have a good husband or wife, good job, good car, and good house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not even to have our sins forgiven and to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The greatest blessing is to receive the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This inclusive Spirit includes the eternal Father, the Creator, the incarnated God, the man Jesus, the Lamb of God, the Redeemer, the resurrected Christ, the Savior, Master, King of kings, and Lord of lords.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a blessing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The blessing of the gospel is not merely forgiveness of sins and regeneration, followed by peace, happiness, comfort, and the hope of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The blessing of the gospel is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the negative side, Galatians 1:4 tells us that Christ gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then on the positive side, 3:13 and 14 say that Christ redeemed us in order that we may receive the promised Spirit as the blessing of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now religion is over, and the Spirit has come.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are through with religion, and we are now in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the Jews must forget Judaism, and the Christians should no longer care for traditional Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nothing is worth holding on to.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We care only for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Having begun by the Spirit, we should not foolishly seek to be perfected by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should simply remain in the all-inclusive Spirit who dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do this, the Bible will become fresh, living, strengthening, and stirring to us; it will never be a book of dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, it will become food to nourish and satisfy us, and day by day we will grow in the divine life and be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then it will be no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE ISSUE OF OUR EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>AS THE SPIRIT BEING THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The issue and outcome of our experience of Christ as the Spirit is the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord is recovering Christ as our life and our person in our experience so that we may have the proper, practical, present, and constant church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord does not intend to recover mere doctrinal teachings, particular practices, or forms.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is recovering our experience of the real, living, indwelling Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit so that we may have a practical daily life in the Spirit and spontaneously become the one Body expressed as the local churches in every locality that we are in. This kind of real, living, and practical church life will push the enemy into the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It will give the Lord the standing to boast, Satan, look at the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have been trying for twenty centuries to damage the building up of My church, but now My church is being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Look at these crazy lovers of Me. They do not care for practices, gifts, or mere doctrinal teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not care even for spirituality or for going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, they are simply being built up together as My church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You can never prevail against this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you touch the church, you will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord will build up His church, and this built-up church will be the stepping stone for His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the building up of the local churches is complete, the Lord will say, Satan, now is My time to return.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time Satan will have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He will be put to shame, and the Lord Jesus will have the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today in Christianity people hold on to ordinances, particular doctrines, and certain gifts, which have resulted in division and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, the Lord is rescuing many out of division and confusion to stand simply for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After a number of years the whole earth will be filled with built-up churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Throughout America, Europe, and many places, the churches will be built up in a glorious and wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We will no longer care for religion with its traditions, the law with its ordinances, the self, or the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will simply have Christ as the Spirit for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord will accomplish this in His recovery.</S>
