We put our trust in You, in Your mercy, in Your blessing, in Your presence, in Your anointing, and in Your reaching each one of us
3 To be strengthened into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God Eph
4) One Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one God, an indivisible mingling of the Triune God with the believers in Christ Eph
Some said, 'Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon?
To 12:00 noon, He was persecuted by men for doing God's will; in the last three hours, He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption
Although the doors were shut where the disciples were, He appeared in their midst and said to them 'Peace to you'
He is compounded with divinity, plus humanity, plus the wonderful all-inclusive death of Christ and the powerful resurrection of Christ
The Lord Jesus said that He is the eternal life , and by believing into Him, we received Him as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
In Him we have God complete, man perfect, death all-inclusive, and resurrection powerful, compounded together as one
Paul prayed that God would open up our eyes, giving us the ability to know the wonderful, mysterious things recorded in Ephesians
The title of this first chapter says that the Body of Christ is the issue of God's impartation and transmission
God imparted Himself into us and transmitted all that He is into us in His divine trinity in the Father, in the Son, and in the Spirit
We may not feel that we have been chosen by God, but Ephesians 1:4 says that before the foundation of the world, God chose us, selected us
We need to keep in mind that God imparted Himself into us in His trinity first in the Father, second in the Son, and third in the Spirit
We may not be able to see how God could have imparted His holy nature into us before the foundation of the world
By His choosing He imparted His holy nature into us, and by His predestinating He imparted His divine life into us
God's predestinating us unto sonship is for the praise of the glory of His grace, that is, for the praise of His expression in grace
The church is also the issue of God the Son's impartation of the divine element into God the Father's chosen and predestinated people
Christ came and He redeemed us out of Adam into Himself out of the world into Himself out of sin into Himself and out of death into Himself
The Father's nature and life are the substance, and the Son's element is the content of the divine nature and life
In Christ and with Christ, we all have been created as a new creation, and this new creation is God's possession
Since Christ has redeemed us into Himself as the element, He has imparted His element, the divine element, into our being
Because we have been redeemed into Christ Christ is the element in which we have been made Gods treasure Gods inheritance Gods possession
Since we are God's inheritance, He put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to Him
He is different because in the conference he was permeated, saturated, and sealed thoroughly with the Spirit for the entire weekend
When we are enjoying the foretaste, we realize this foretaste guarantees that God is coming to be our full taste
Now the Triune God as the substance as the element and as the essence are altogether imparted into us and this imparting is still going on
We need to realize that God's nature, God's life, Christ's element, and the Spirit's essence have been imparted into us
To know the outward features and appearance of our body is easy but to know the intrinsic composition and structure of our body is difficult
We know this because Ephesians 1:4 says that God chose us in Christ 'before the foundation of the world to be holy'
At the moment we believed in the Lord Jesus, God the Spirit planted or sowed Himself as a little seed into our being
The living, holy seed of the divine nature had been growing within me, and this living, organic divine nature did not agree to kick the ball
Ephesians 1:4 says that God chose us to be holy, and verse 5 says that in choosing us, He predestinated us unto sonship
We always need to be kept by remembering that we are sons of God who have God's life, the divine life, and God's nature, the holy nature
The Body of Christ is the issue of God the Father's impartation of His holy nature and of His divine life into His chosen people
Christ redeemed us out of Adam into Him, out of the world into Him, out of sin into Him, and out of death into Him
In Ephesians 1:7-12 we are told that we sinners, after being redeemed into Christ, have become God's inheritance, His treasure
The element is more intrinsic than the substance, and within the element is something even more intrinsic the essence
When Christ redeemed us, He redeemed us into Himself as an element with which He made us a treasure to God, an inheritance
Now we have the Father's nature and life, we have the Son's element, and we have the Spirit's essence all divine
The Body of Christ is not only composed of but also constituted with God's nature, God's life, God's element, and God's essence
He knew that a Christian husband should love his wife and should not divorce, but he said he could not make it and had no way to go on
All things were subjected under His feet, and He was given to be the Head over all things to the church, to the Body
We also have the Triune God, processed and consummated, as the power operating upon us and within us to make us powerful
In chapter one of Ephesians, the Body of Christ is the coming out, the issue, of God's impartation and transmission
For the church as the Body of Christ there is the need of life, but for the new man there is the need of life plus the person
Within us there is not only the divine nature, the divine life, the divine element, and the divine essence, but also the divine person
In Ephesians 2 we are told definitely that Christ created the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers, the two, into one new man
Religious Jews, of course, do not eat pork, but the Gentiles eat pork and many of them are a constitution of pork
When He was working there to terminate us, He put into us something of Himself, which is His element of the resurrection life
Now the ones who have been terminated through Christ's cross have something of Christ as the element in resurrection
While He was on the cross terminating us, He was also putting something of Himself as the divine element in resurrection into our being
When we passed through termination on the cross, we became a new man with Christ as the element in resurrection
The cross clears up and terminates all the negative things, while His resurrection life is the best glue to stick us together
He put this clean material into His resurrection life, and this resurrection life glued us together to make us one entity
He created a new man; second, by creating us, the Jews and Gentiles, into one new man, He reconciled us all, Jews and Gentiles, in one Body
When we were the old man, we were dead in our offenses and sins , but we were enlivened by God with Christ as life organically
He subjected all things other than Christ under our feet and gave Christ to be the Head over everything for us, making us a part of the Head
All things have been subjected under the feet of this new man, and the Head of this new man is over all things
Christ was creating, crossing out the old man, and God was putting in the new element, that is, Christ's resurrection life
The leading ones should pray and fellowship together as a new man, taking Christ as their life and taking Christ also as their person
The saints who have gone to Moscow for the spread of the Lord's recovery have seen that religious tradition still remains there
Some refused to be baptized after they believed in the Lord because they had been baptized when they were infants
Even though religion was cut off by Lenin more than seventy years ago, the Russian Orthodox tradition still remains among them
Far, we have seen from Ephesians 1 that the church is the issue of the divine impartation and the divine transmission
We know according to the New Testament revelation that this new element could never be applied to us without His resurrection
While Christ was busy creating the new man, God was also busy making us dead ones alive with the resurrected Christ as life
When the brothers come together to talk about church affairs they may talk in a way that is full of the natural life and the natural concept
After the meetings, those of us who were caring for the conference would go to another room for refreshments and further fellowship
He told her that her prayer in the meeting was altogether in the flesh, and he asked her not to do this anymore in any meeting
The next evening we were waiting to have dinner together; afterwards, we would go to the meeting hall, which was across the street
It is difficult to be an elder because we members in the church often act, behave, speak, and even 'prophesy' in the meetings in the old man
My burden in sharing these messages is to bring us some light from the Lord so that we can see what the real church life is
The real church life is the acting, the working, the behaving, the prophesying, the speaking, and the serving in the new man
When the elders say that each saint should speak for no longer than one minute, we should function for no longer than one minute
The Lord has crucified the old man on the cross, and His divine element has been applied to us in His resurrection
It reveals that the Body of Christ is the consummation of the believers' enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ
It shows that the Body of Christ is the consummation of the believers' experience of the unlimited Christ making His home in their hearts
Ephesians 3:8 says that Paul announced, ministered, dispensed, the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel
Isaiah 9:6 says that Christ as the child born to us and the son given to us is the mighty God and the eternal Father
What He is what He has what He has accomplished what He has attained and what He has obtained all are included in His unsearchable riches!
In his first Epistle, Peter said that when we New Testament priests preach the gospel, we are telling out Christ's virtues
Paul said that he was assigned by God, appointed by God, to announce the unsearchable riches of Christ to the Gentiles
The church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, is the issue of the enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ
Paul prayed for all of us that the Father of all the families would strengthen us with power through His Spirit into our inner man
A brother may remain in his mind from morning to evening, thinking about how someone has not treated him so well in the past few days
The sisters remain in their emotions when they go shopping, buying things according to their likes and dislikes
These are the three 'apartments' of our 'building,' our being the mind apartment, the emotion apartment, and the will apartment
When we return home, something may offend us, and we will lose our temper in our emotion and exchange words with our spouse in our mind
Together we will have the ability and the strength to apprehend four things in the universe the breadth, length, height, and depth
No one can tell how broad the breadth is, how long the length is, how high the height is, or how deep the depth is
When we apprehend the dimensions of Christ, we will go on to know His great love, which is knowledge-surpassing
The result, the issue, the coming out of all of this is all the fullness of the processed, consummated Triune God
The fullness of God is the Body of Christ as the expression of the Triune God to the fullest, to the uttermost
If the churches were like this, all the criticism would be stopped, all the opinions would be over, and all the disputes would be gone
These turmoils take place because we are still in the old man, in the flesh, in the natural man, and in the self
Divorce between husband and wife is the result of an accumulation of friction between them over a period of time
The proper church life is also the issue of Christ personally making His home in our heart to occupy every corner of our inner being
Prayer: Lord, this morning we ask You to give us a trance that transfers us from the visible circumstances into the invisible scene
Daniel 10 records the fighting in the unseen world between Michael, the prince of Israel, and the evil princes of Persia and Greece
The Lord spoke of regeneration in the invisible realm, but Nicodemus tried to understand it in the visible realm
The divine revelation in the holy Word, especially in the New Testament, speaks altogether of invisible things
Many readers of the Bible understand it merely according to the letter in the visible realm, but they never see anything invisible
In Ephesians 5 Paul charges the husbands to love their wives , and he charges the wives to submit themselves to their husbands
Do you believe the human mind can understand that our God, the Father, chose us before the foundation of the world?
The Lord Jesus told Nicodemus that he needed to be born again, but Nicodemus understood this in a physical sense
He was not speaking of being born of our parents with our natural life but of being born of the Spirit with the divine life
For years we have been in the sphere of understanding Your holy Word in our natural concept and in the natural view
Previously we saw from Ephesians 2 that while the Lord Jesus was being visibly and outwardly crucified on the cross He was working invisibly
When Christ was crucified on the cross, we believers, both Jewish and Gentile, were included in Him and crucified with Him
In the meantime, God the Father came in to enliven each one of us with the resurrected Christ as life, as the enlivening element
We need to pray, 'Lord, we ask You to give us a trance that transfers us from the natural sphere into another sphere, the spiritual sphere'
We have seen many groups of people, but have we seen this small group of four persons one human and three divine?
The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is mingled with the believers
The natural humanity has been crucified, resurrected, uplifted, and mingled with the three of the Divine Trinity
God the Father, who is over all, through all, and in all, is the origin, the source, of the entire view of the Body of Christ
We have ministry meetings and church meetings to be gathered together into Christ so that we can be thoroughly mingled with Him
The Lord as the Head perfects us not directly but indirectly through His gifts the apostles prophets evangelists and shepherds and teachers
One new brother might say that he has a problem because he does not know whether his baptism was genuine or not
All the saints are perfected to do the same work as the apostles, as the prophets, as the evangelists, and as the shepherds and teachers
The church will be growing up to have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, the Body of Christ
In the next section of Ephesians 4, there is the building up with a bigger group of all the members of the Body of Christ
The built up Body of Christ is the goal to which we all have to attain, and this is the destination at which we all have to arrive
The one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father are grouped together and are being mingled together
Eventually, one of them said that after studying the human body and analyzing it, they had to recognize that there must be a Creator
While he was on the way to Damascus to persecute the Lord's disciples, the Lord Jesus, the invisible One, caught him
It was to this one, later to be called Paul, that the Spirit of truth eventually disclosed many mysterious things
Paul said that he received an assignment, a charge, and a burden from God to complete the word of God, the divine revelation
The Lord went on to say that He would build His church upon this rock, upon this revelation concerning Christ which Peter received
The Lord did not tell Peter that the church was His Body because He knew that Peter would not be able to apprehend it
Who told Paul of the one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father with one hope, one faith, and one baptism ?
Paul saw that in eternity past before the foundation of the world, God selected us in Christ that we might be made holy
With this element we saved ones will be made God's inheritance, and eventually the entire universe will be headed up in Christ
We need revelation to see all the wonderful things revealed to Paul concerning the Body of Christ in the book of Ephesians
These verses speak of seven 'ones' one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father with one hope, one faith, and one baptism
These seven 'ones' describe a universal, marvelous, wonderful mingling of the Triune God with His redeemed and uplifted people
The Spirit, the Son, and the Father are mingled with the Body through baptism and faith, with a hope of something to come
According to Ephesians 4:8, He captured all of Satan's captives, and He made Satan's captives His own captives
Of perfecting the saints, however, the traditional practice of Christianity annuls all the functions of the members of the Body of Christ
We have come back to the pure Word, and we are here practicing the new way, in which everyone is being perfected to function
The burden of this ministry is to perfect the saints to be living, active, positive, functioning members of the Body of Christ
We need to be perfected to prophesy, to speak something for God and to speak something of Christ forth into others
Some of the sisters spend a great deal of time to style their hair, and yet they say that they do not have time for morning revival
To grow in life is to grow into the Head, Christ, but to operate in the Body of Christ is to operate out from Him
The Body is joined together through the joints of the rich supply and knit together through each one part functioning in its measure
Through the functioning of all the members, all the Body causes the growth of the Body, and this growth is for the building up
The first section of Ephesians 4 shows us that mingling is going on, and the second section shows us that building is going on
They are finding a way to mingle Themselves with persons who are so strong in their mind and fluctuating in their emotion
During the time of courtship, the brother thought that the sister was wonderful, and the sister thought the same about the brother
When a mother wants to give a dose of medicine to her child, the child may refuse to take it and struggle with her
In a meeting, we may behave ourselves as ladies and gentlemen, but when the meeting is dismissed, we immediately begin to misbehave
He prayed for us that we might also have a trance, that is, that we might have a spirit of wisdom and revelation
The three of the Godhead are one, and these three are now working in the Body to mingle Themselves with the Body
In the Lord's prayer in John 17, He revealed that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three of the Divine Trinity, are one
In a meeting a husband and a wife may sing together in oneness, but when they return home from the meeting, they may fight with each other
In the section of Ephesians 4 on the building, Paul speaks of his desire that we would be no longer children, no longer babes
We need to grow in the divine life until we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God
If we take the proper, scriptural way, however, we can gain the increase, and we can receive a reward when the Lord comes back
In the parable for faithfulness in Matthew 25, the slave did not make any profit for his master and told his master that he was a hard man
Whether or not we take the scriptural way in this age may determine whether or not we are rewarded in the next age
Our eternal salvation is based upon the person of Christ as the Savior and upon His work of redemption with His redeeming blood
If we contend for anything other than the items of our faith , we will be divided, and we will even become divisive
The Southern Baptists say that you must be immersed by them in the water in their baptistry to become a member of their denomination
Today we should not care where someone is baptized, and we should never contend with people about the method of baptism
The troubles come because of the immature saints being carried about by the winds of different teachings, doctrines, concepts, and opinions
The faithful gifts the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are doing their best to perfect the saints
The joints will be supplying to join the Body together and the parts will be operating to knit the Body together
If we did not have this book, we would have no guide, no direction, and no light concerning the details of the Body of Christ
We can see the mingling of the processed Triune God with the regenerated believers and the building up of the Body of Christ
May the Lord have mercy upon all of us that our eyes would be fully opened to see the intrinsic view of the Body of Christ
In Ephesians 4 two aspects of the oneness of the Body are unveiled the oneness in reality and the oneness in practicality
The Lord Jesus told us that as the one grain of wheat, He fell into the ground to die so that He could bear much fruit
One day, He created man, and the man He created was multiplying and increasing all the time to replenish the whole earth
In His resurrection, He imparted the divine life into us to make us His brothers and the many sons of the Triune God
At one time this oneness was only among the three divine persons of the Godhead, but now it has gotten into millions of believers
The oneness we enjoy is just a miniature of the great universal oneness of the entire universal Body of Christ
The children of a father are the same as their father in life, but they are not the same as he is in his fatherhood
The oneness in reality is the oneness of the one Spirit as the essence with the oneness of the one Body the one place to stay
The Spirit is the essence of the oneness, this Spirit is staying in the one Body, and the one Body is our lodging place
The oneness in reality is the oneness of the one Lord as the element with the oneness of the one faith the one transfer into Christ
The oneness of the one Lord as the element is also with the oneness of the one baptism the one transfer out of Adam
The oneness in reality is also the oneness of the one Father as the source, who is over all, through all, and in all
We want to be in a trance, in an invisible sphere, to see the invisible reality of the oneness of the Body of Christ
Although we are of different races and from different places we are one because the same One is over us all, through us all, and in us all
Recently, a Russian couple came to a church meeting in Anaheim and asked how they could become members of our church
Your feeling and attitude toward him will have been affected, and your oneness with him will have been damaged
Some refused to be baptized after they received the Lord because they had been baptized when they were infants
Although religion was cut off in Russia by Lenin more than seventy years ago, the 'barking' of traditional religion still remains
All of the believers in Christ were born into the oneness of reality but we all need to go on until we arrive at the oneness in practicality
He was buried for three days and He resurrected physically, psychologically, and spiritually to be the Spirit indwelling us
We believe in Him as such a person, and we believe in His redemptive work in dying for us and being resurrected
Many gospel contacts wonder why there are so many different kinds of so-called churches since we all believe in one Jesus
The Word will show us the right way; the Word will assure us of the right thing; and the Word will keep us in the oneness in reality
The full knowledge of the Son of God is the apprehension of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience
If we are perfected and completed in knowing Christ, we will not suffer the loss of the oneness of reality in our practice
We know this oneness, and we are also practicing this oneness, the oneness in reality and the oneness in practicality
To arrive at the oneness in practicality, we need to hold to truth in love to grow up in all things into the Head, Christ
Eventually, we will be a full-grown man with the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, the Body of Christ
The apostle Paul spoke of the Body of Christ and warned the believers about division damaging the oneness of the Body
If He were not the life-giving Spirit, He could never be our wisdom: our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption
If He were not the life-giving Spirit, He could not have come into us, and He would have nothing to do with us in our experience
We may not be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion, so when Jesus comes to 'play on us,' we do not sound so well
When one sister shares, she receives many 'amens,' but when another one shares, she does not receive many 'amens'
Otherwise, their appraisers, like the fleshly Corinthians, might be puffed up on behalf of one, against the other
When divisive ones come together to take the Lord's table, it is not for the better, not for profit, but for the worse, for loss
In discerning the Body of Christ, we should not partake of the bread in any division or with any divisive spirit
Paul said that because of this many among the Corinthians were weak and sick physically, and even a number were sleeping
We should also consider that this bread signifies Christ's mystical Body, which comprises all the believers in the whole universe
Corinthians 12 says that those members of the Body which we consider to be less honorable, these we should clothe with more abundant honor
If we think that there is something wrong with the elders or the other saints, we should not gossip about them
We must always remember that there is no way for the members of the Body of Christ to be legitimately divided in the Body of Christ
In other words, no division is legitimate, and no division is justified, regardless of how strong our reason is
All problems can and should be solved through proper and adequate fellowship by praying together sincerely and thoroughly
By this kind of adequate and thorough fellowship, they arrived at a conclusion by the leading and guidance of the Spirit
We would all come together to pray thoroughly, and then we would open up the holy Word to study and fellowship about all the concerns
None of us should make an issue over the practice of the new way versus the old way, because these ways are not our faith
Calling people on the phone, writing letters, sending booklets, and any other kind of contact with people is a kind of 'knocking on doors'
In order to keep the oneness, we need to remain in our spirit so that we can be kept in fellowship with the Lord
We should fellowship by seeking the Lord's solution with an open spirit, a pure heart, a lowly mind, and a meek attitude
Also, we should fellowship according to the teaching of the Scriptures properly interpreted, not understood by taking them out of context
It is according to the Scriptures by their wrong interpretation, by their twisting, and by their taking certain verses out of context
To solve any problem in fellowship no parties or divisions should be formed for backing in partiality threatening andor challenging others
Some members are very factious, very sectarian, very divisive, and their purpose in contacting others is to cause division
If a person is sick with a highly contagious disease, he is quarantined, separated even from his family members, until he is healed
Anyone who is spiritually sick of the disease of division, having become a divisive person, must be quarantined
