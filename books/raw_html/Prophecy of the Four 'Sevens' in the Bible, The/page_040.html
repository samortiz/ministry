<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Rapture of the Two Witnesses<br>into Christ's Parousia (Presence) in the Air</H2><P>Included in the seventh trumpet is the rapture of the two witnesses into Christ's parousia (presence) in the air (Rev. 11:12). The two witnesses will probably be raptured on the same day as the majority of the saints. Revelation 12:6 says that the woman, symbolizing the majority of the saints, will be nourished in a place prepared by God for a thousand two hundred sixty days, or three and a half years. Therefore, their rapture must be on the last day of those three and a half years. The two witnesses prophesy a thousand two hundred sixty days (Rev. 11:3), so they must also be raptured on the last day of the three and a half years. Thus, both the majority of the saints and the two witnesses will be raptured on the last day of the great tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Giving of Reward to the Saints<br>at the Judgment Seat of Christ</H2><P>Then there will be the giving of reward to the saints at the judgment seat of Christ in the air (Rev. 11:18c; 2 Cor. 5:10). Christ will judge His believers, not concerning their eternal salvation, but concerning their dispensational reward.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The Marriage of the Lamb</H2><P>After the rewarding of the saints, there will be the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:5-10). Christ will marry the overcomers as His bride.</P><P>The above items are the positive side of the seventh trumpet. Now we need to see the negative side.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. On the Negative Side</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Seven Bowls&#151;the Third Woe,<br>the Last Seven Plagues to Finish the Fury of God,<br>as God's Most Severe Judgment on Men,<br>the Main Part of the Plagues of the Seventh Trumpet</H2><P>The seven bowls are the third woe (Rev. 11:14), the last seven plagues to finish the fury of God (Rev. 15:1), as God's most severe judgment on men, the main part of the plagues of the seventh trumpet (Rev. 15:7&#151;16:1). After the seven bowls, God's fury will be finished.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The First Four Bowls<br>Consisting of the Four Aspects<br>of the Most Severe Supernatural Calamities<br>on the Earth and on the Heavens</H2><P>The first four bowls consist of the four aspects of the most severe supernatural calamities on the earth and on the heavens (Rev. 16:2-9). Thus, supernatural calamities will occur three times: in the sixth seal, the first four trumpets, and the first four bowls. The sixth seal is the initiation of supernatural calamities, the first four trumpets are the intensified supernatural calamities, and the first four bowls are the most severe supernatural calamities. These calamities will damage the earth and the heavens, making the earth an unsuitable place in which to live.</P>
