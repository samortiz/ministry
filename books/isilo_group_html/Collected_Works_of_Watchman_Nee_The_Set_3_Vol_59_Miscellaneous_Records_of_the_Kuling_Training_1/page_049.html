God has established proper relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, and masters and servants. I would like to draw our attention to the two books in the Bible that rank the highest in spirituality&mdash;Ephesians and Colossians. Both books have two sections. The first section declares spiritual facts, while the second section discusses practical issues of this life. The first section is positive while the second section is negative. In both Epistles of such high standing, there is reference to authority in the family. Both books speak of the relationships between husbands and wives, fathers and sons, and masters and servants. Ephesians 5 and 6 charge us to know authority in the family. According to the divine ordination for the family, the husband should be the authority, and the wife should submit to him. The wife cannot be the authority. Between father and son, the father is the authority. A son may be more educated than the father, but authority still rests with the parents. God has not made children the authority. In the same way, between master and servant, the master is the authority. A servant has to obey his master in all things. Ephesians 6 and Colossians 3 both speak of servants serving their masters as if serving God. The Bible clearly tells us to obey all forms of authority and to be right in our attitude towards them. Wherever we find husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and servants, we find the presence of God's authority.</p><p>God's authority in the universe is being carried out through human government. The same authority is also carried out through family relationships. God's principle of authority has not changed since the creation of the world. Of the sixty-six books of the Bible, Ephesians and Colossians rank the highest in spirituality, but neither of them neglect the importance of upholding God's authority. These two books do not put authority aside. In reading them I marvel at Paul, who, though erudite in the lofty things of the Spirit, was not negligent of the relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, and masters and servants. This shows us that from the creation of the world until now, God has not given up on the matter of authority. Paul shows us in Colossians 3 and 4 that God wants believers to uphold His authority in the church and in the family. He speaks similarly in 1 Timothy 6 and Titus 2 and 3. His words to Timothy and Titus are similar. When he wrote to these spiritual sons, he charged them in the same way. It seems as if he was saying, "This is my teaching, and you have to teach the same thing." Paul charged Timothy and Titus to speak the same thing and not to change his teaching. These four books are very special. While Ephesians and Colossians are on high truths, 1 Timothy and Titus are on the work. On the one hand, Paul spoke on the subject of authority in the highest books on spirituality. On the other hand, he spoke on the same subject in his Epistles related to the work. Towards the end of the apostolic age, we find the same admonition. In his first Epistle Peter said, "Household servants, be subject in all fear to your masters, not only to the good and forbearing but also to the crooked" (2:18). Again he said, "In like manner, wives, be subject to your own husbands, that even if any disobey the word, they will be gained without the word through the manner of life of their wives" (3:1). Ninety percent of husbands who do not accept the Lord reject Him because of disobedience in their wives. The above verses clearly show us that God intends that we uphold authority in all human relationships.</p><p>Some may have a problem here. When Paul and Peter wrote their Epistles, the Roman Empire was at the height of its power, and slavery was extremely prevalent. Male and female slaves were sold in open markets. It was a cruel business. Some may ask, "Should we allow such an inhumane institution to remain?" Of course, the church does not support slavery, but Paul exhorted slaves to obey their masters on the one hand, and he charged masters to deal well with their slaves on the other hand. Onesimus was a runaway slave, but Paul told Philemon to treat him well. He had no intention of overturning the institution of slavery. It was not a matter of the merit or evil of the system but a matter of God's authority. Whether or not the institution of slavery is justified is a different issue altogether. God's ordination is for slaves to submit to authority. It is better for us to live with a wrong system and uphold God's authority than to destroy a system and thus destroy God's authority in the process. On the one hand, we realize the injustice that existed in the society of the time. On the other hand, we realize that with an institution as wrong and inhumane as slavery, God did not give up His authority.</p><h2 class="head1">IN OTHER RELATIONSHIPS</h2><p>In addition to the family, we have male-female relationships. The Bible shows that both men and women have a proper place. God ordains that there be order and authority between male and female. Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 11 that God is the head of Christ, and the man is the head of the woman (v. 3). Between the sexes God has established authority. Paul said that every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head (v. 5). He also said that women are not permitted to speak in the churches (14:34). In 1 Timothy 2 he forbade women from teaching (v. 12). Yet today many women are teaching. It seems that the tendency for women to preach has been present from the beginning. God charges women to come under authority. Between men and women, the former stand for authority, while the latter stand for obedience.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
