[1]  Last time, we had a completely new arrangement of the church in Taipei.
[2]  Simply speaking, if the church is to be built up and move forward, to grow spiritually, to know the truth, and to bear fruit in the gospel, there must be the elders leadership on the administrative side, and the six items of spiritual work on the spiritual side: the campus gospel work, the home meetings, the home gospel, the gospel to all levels of society, the children s work, plus the visitation and shepherding in each hall.
[3]  The church meetings were not built up in the big meetings in the temple, but rather, the church meetings were built up in every house, from house to house.
[4]  From this we see that the propagation of the Lord s gospel and the spreading of the testimony of the Lord s church did not depend primarily on the apostles, but rather on those who were dispersed.
[5]  THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING UPON HOME MEETINGS TO LAY ITS FOUNDATION
[6]  It mentioned that for the church to be built up, it must use pilings for its foundation in order to be stable.
[7]  As an example to illustrate his point, he said that the church assembly hall in Taiwan practiced home meetings and that they did the best in driving pilings.
[8]  Perhaps you may say that your home meeting has not waned, nor has it withered, but I am afraid that over half of our home meetings are already like a night-blooming flower; midnight has passed and they have started to droop.
[9]  Brothers and sisters, when you come to the meeting, do you expect to hear a capable speaker?
[10]  The left side is the big meetings and the right side is the home meetings; thus the big meetings and the home meetings are balanced.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO THE CONTENTS OF THE HOME MEETINGS 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:22-24, 32-33, 36-38, 41-42; 5:42; 1 Cor 2:2; 14:23a, 26; 1 Tim 1:3-4 CONTINUING IN THE TEACHING
[12]  In this message we will continue to speak on home meetings.
[13]  When Peter initiated the church meetings, it was under the direct working of God.
[14]  With Peter in the beginning in Acts 2 and 5, the church meetings consisted of both big meetings and small gatherings.
[15]  When the church was first established, the believers preached only of Christ s incarnation, His human living on the earth, His being persecuted, His being crucified, and His entering into the suffering of death, and of God s raising Him from the dead, exalting Him into the heavenlies, and making Him both Lord and Christ, whereupon He poured out the all-inclusive Spirit.
[16]  These are the contents of the church meetings and the basic principle of the church meetings, which principle is just Christ.
[17]  It is not that you have nothing before the meeting, yet you bring your Bible and come empty-handed, thinking that because you have had a terrible week, you have nothing, but are assured that in the meeting you will receive grace.
[18]  HOME MEETINGS BEING LIKE THE ARK OF GOD, REQUIRING EVERYONE S SHOULDER
[19]  Big meetings allow people to slip in, but after not too long people also slip out.
[20]  If we only emphasize the big meetings and neglect the home meetings, we will let the Lord down.
[21]  Today in the church meetings, if everyone has experienced Christ and everyone has brought Christ to the meetings, then whether there is anyone among us who can give messages or not, that would not affect the foundation of our meetings.
[22]  This does not mean that once we go back to the home meetings we will drop all big meetings.
[23]  The big meetings are one wing and the home meetings are another wing.
[24]  OF THE HOME MEETINGS AND BIG MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor 14:23b, 26
[25]  I originally intended to use only the first two nights to speak about the home meetings.
[26]  Tonight I will speak more on the comparison of the profit and loss of the home meetings and the big meetings.
[27]  Here we see a clear picture that the church meetings include on the one hand the big meetings and on the other hand the small gatherings.
[28]  ONE BEING ABLE TO SPEAK AS SOON AS HE IS SAVED
[29]  Once we began to practice the small groups people were brought in. On the other hand, because there were not many capable speakers, the message delivery was not that strong.
[30]  On the spiritual side, once we are saved, we have the Spirit of the Lord, we pray, we read the Bible, we attend the meetings, and we listen to so many messages.
[31]  The big meetings in the temple and the small gatherings from house to house are equally important.
[32]  When I first started the home meetings I mentioned that there were three hundred people meeting in a meeting hall.
[33]  CHAPTER FOUR THE CONTENTS OF THE HOME MEETINGS 2
[34]  The most difficult area with the home meetings is their contents.
[35]  We all must come back to the Bible, to pay attention to the building up of the home meetings according to the revelation and principle of the Bible, and to nurture the several thousand brothers and sisters in Taipei in the home meetings.
[36]  If you have this kind of living, you will be living not only when you come to the home meeting but even when you are at home.
[37]  Many brothers and sisters can testify that eleven years ago we did not have the Life-study Messages.
[38]  At that time, when we read the Bible and came to a difficult word, we would go from reference book to reference book.
[39]  If we do not build up the home meetings, I can assure you that the church will have no future.
[40]  As we attend the home meetings, we must bring them out of the common realm: out of the commonness of religion, the commonness of tradition, and the commonness of death.
[41]  The Bible says that the church is a family.
[42]  The New Testament shows us that the church is the church of God, the church of Christ, and the church of the saints Acts 20:28; Rom 16:16; 1 Cor 14:33 .
[43]  Dear brothers, all of us must have such a new concept, a new sense that we are the owners of the church.
[44]  The church being God s kingdom is based upon the church being God s family.
[45]  We love the big meetings, but the big meetings are not for the big meetings.
[46]  In the past whenever we asked certain brothers to take care of a meeting hall, those who took care of that meeting hall would compete for manpower and financial resources for that hall.
[47]  Brothers, please remember that when you administrate the church, you are not administrating for that local church, but for Christ s universal Body.
[48]  If a brother in that local church has the burden to move to South America, you should not restrain him, but rather you should thank the Lord and encourage him, giving him an allowance for travel, family support, and three years living expenses.
[49]  When we go to a home meeting we should never have an attitude that when we go to raise up that home meeting, we go to take the lead.
[50]  Because you go there to function, and you supply the meeting more than others, naturally in the Lord s eyes you are a pillar in that home meeting, and that home meeting has become strong because you have functioned.
[51]  Whether it be a big meeting or a small meeting, for the meeting to be rich and strong there must be the word of the Lord and the Spirit.
[52]  For all these years, the reason we in the Lord s recovery have been so blessed by the Lord has been because of the Lord s word and the Lord s truth.
[53]  When you attend the home meeting, you must not divide the message rigidly: you see that it has eight pages, so you read four this time and four the next time, like a quack doctor performing a surgery.
