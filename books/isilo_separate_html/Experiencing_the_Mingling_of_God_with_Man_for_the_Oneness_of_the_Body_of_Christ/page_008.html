<h1 class="title">BEING MINGLED WITH GOD<br />
TO REALIZE THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:6; 4:24; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17; John 6:57, 63; 14:20; Gal. 2:20; Matt. 10:19-20; John 17:21-23; 1 Cor. 12:13</h1>
<p>There are two crucial matters in the Scriptures&mdash;Christ as life and the Body of Christ. We see the first matter at the beginning of the Scriptures, where there is the tree of life, and we see the second matter at the end of the Scriptures, where there is the holy city, a composition of many persons as one Body. This shows us that God&rsquo;s intention is that He would be life to us so that we would be built together in His life as one Body, the holy city. This is the central message of the entire Scriptures.</p>
<p>In this message we would like to see the matters of mingling and oneness. Mingling is related to life, whereas oneness is related to the Body. Mingling is a matter of God becoming life to us (Lev. 2:4-5; 1 Cor. 6:17); when we take God as our life and God becomes life to us, He mingles Himself with us. Oneness, on the other hand, is a matter of the Body. When we saved ones are built together as the Body, we have the oneness. Thus, we may say that God&rsquo;s intention is to become life to us so that we would be built together as one Body. We may also say that God&rsquo;s intention is to mingle Himself with us so that we may become one with Him and with one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING THE LORD AS OUR SPIRITUAL FOOD<br />
TO BE MINGLED WITH HIM</h2>
<p>Many years ago I was taught that our relationship with God was a matter of union and that we were united with God and joined to the Lord. However, one day as I was preaching and teaching this matter of union, the word <em>mingling</em> came to me. I realized that our relationship with God is not only a matter of union but also a matter of mingling, which is much deeper. The word <em>mingled</em> can be found in Leviticus 2, where it is used by the Holy Spirit to describe God&rsquo;s desire in His relationship with man. Verse 5 says that in preparing the meal offering the oil had to be mingled with the fine flour. The oil signifies God Himself as the Holy Spirit (Luke 4:18; Heb. 1:9), and the fine flour signifies the Lord Jesus&rsquo; humanity. Thus, the oil being mingled with the fine flour signifies God being mingled with humanity. The oil and the fine flour signify divinity and humanity as two different natures being mingled together as one. However, this mingling does not produce a third nature; rather, the two natures remain distinguishable in their combination.</p>
<p>Whatever we eat becomes mingled with us; thus, the best way for something to become mingled with us is for us to eat it. Although this is very clear and simple, most of the time we do not apply this to our relationship with the Lord Jesus. We must be impressed by the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 6: &ldquo;I am the bread of life...He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (vv. 48, 57). The Lord told us that He is the bread of life and that we may eat Him. This word concerning eating the Lord is very simple and practical, yet we do not pay much attention to it. Have you experienced eating Christ as your food in order to live by Him? If you have never experienced Christ in such a practical way, I am concerned for you as a Christian. We must have some real experiences of Christ. Every day I have the experience of eating and living by the food that I eat. If I had not eaten today, I would be tired and weak. But because I have eaten something, I am refreshed and strengthened, and I am living by what I ate. Every child knows how to eat. We must know how to take Christ as our food, how to eat Him, and how to live by Him. Our taking the Lord as our food day by day is the only way for God to be mingled with us. We must all consider and ask ourselves whether we have had the real experience of taking the Lord as our food day by day and living by Him.</p>
<p>Once I asked a group of believers whether they had had such an experience of taking the Lord as their food and living by Him. One sister told me that she had experienced the Lord in this way many times. She said that whenever she got into trouble or had some burden or difficulty, she would go to the Lord and commit her burdens to Him, and the Lord would take her burdens and bear them Himself. Actually, this is not an experience of taking the Lord as food. Suppose you had a burden, and you asked your food to bear the burden. If your food could speak, it would tell you, &ldquo;Leave your burden on your shoulders. I want to come into you to be digested by you and energize you to bear the burden. I will not take this burden away from you. Rather, when you eat and digest me, I will become your constituents to energize you to bear the burden. I will be your energy and strength so that you will be able to bear what you by yourself cannot bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a certain time the apostle Paul was given a thorn in his flesh. Because he was just as human as we are, he went to the Lord and prayed three times that the Lord would take the thorn away. However, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;I will not take the thorn away from you, because My grace is sufficient for you, and My strength is perfected in weakness. My way is not to help you by taking away the thorn. My way is to strengthen you with Myself as the sufficient grace. My grace, which is simply Myself, will be your strength to energize you to suffer the thorn&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:7-9). This is the way that the Lord deals with us. Our concept, which is wrong, is that whenever we get into trouble we should go to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, be merciful to me and remove this trouble.&rdquo; Sometimes the Lord does something to remove the burden or difficulty, but the more we grow in the Lord, the more we will discover that many of the difficulties and troubles that we encounter the Lord does not take away. Instead, the Lord leaves them with us and causes us to learn to take Him as our food and our life supply to become inwardly energized. When our inner man, our spirit, is energized, we become strong enough to bear the burden and suffer all our troubles while praising Him. This is the way the Lord deals with us, and this is the way we can experience the Lord as our food and live by Him. By doing this we will grow with the Lord and in the Lord, and the Lord Himself will increase in us day by day.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
