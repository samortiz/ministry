<h1 class="title">CHRIST BECAME A CURSE FOR US</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gal. 3:13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The origin of the curse
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The curse came from sin.</li>
	<li>God brought in the curse after Adam sinned. God said, &ldquo;Cursed is the ground for thy sake&rdquo; (Gen. 3:17).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The sign of the curse
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The sign of the curse is thorns. After Adam sinned, the earth brought forth thorns because of the curse. So thorns are the sign of being cursed.</li>
	<li>The outstanding feature of thorns is that they prick, causing pain.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The execution of the curse
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The curse is carried out through the law. The law administers the curse. Once man sinned, God&rsquo;s law then administered the curse upon man.</li>
	<li>Therefore, the curse is related to the law of God, and is the demand of the righteousness of God upon sinners.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The nullification of the curse
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When Christ bore our sins, He also took our curse. Since the problem of sin is resolved, so is the problem of the curse.</li>
	<li>When Christ bore our sins on the cross, He wore a crown of thorns. Since the thorns are a sign of the curse, this shows that He took our curse on the cross.</li>
	<li>Since Christ was cursed in our stead on the cross, the demand of the law was fulfilled and He could redeem us from the curse of the law.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to have the curse removed<br />
