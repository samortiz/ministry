   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Importance of Being Balanced</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Our Christian Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of James is a balance to those who are unbalanced in their Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps in your Christian life you are wholly for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, in your daily personal life you may be very short in the way you speak and handle matters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning a number of things you may lack wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although you are a good soldier fighting for God s economy, in your daily life you may not be complete and entire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may not trust in God very much, and you may not pray to Him concerning your needs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because you are good in the major things but lacking in certain practical things, you need balance in your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first thing the Epistle of James provides us with is this needed balance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have indicated, the book of James also serves as a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>James was outstanding in the matter of practical Christian perfection; he was a godly man who knew God, who loved God, and who prayed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But James was hindered by his godliness and veiled by his religion from seeing a thorough vision concerning God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1:27 James speaks of pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As far as proper human behavior is concerned, we may need to be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may be absolutely for God s economy, and yet we may be wrong in the way we speak to others or deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose a brother says, Don t you know that I am utterly for God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have sacrificed everything for this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Day by day, I give my future to the Lord for His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Don t you appreciate this?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, such a brother may be for God s economy, but he still needs practical Christian perfection in his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once again we see that we need to be balanced: we need a clear vision concerning God s economy, and we need practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should be warned from the Epistle of James that we may be very godly, yet still lack a clear view concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Someone may be godly, humble, and meek in his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But he may not be able to fight for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to fight for God s economy, we must learn the proper strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul was a person who was balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, he was an excellent fighter; on the other hand, he was a godly person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul even encouraged Timothy, his younger co-worker, to exercise himself unto godliness 1 Tim 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In paying attention to the major things of God s economy, we should not neglect the practical details of our personal daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The vast majority of today s Christians pay more attention to minor matters in their daily life than they do to the major matters of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In fact, many seeking Christians take care of very few of the things that are truly major.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These Christians may be religious and godly, they may pray a great deal, they may have faith and endurance, and they may love God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In their Christian life they are imitators of James.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But they have not seen God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because it is possible for us to be this kind of Christian, we need the warning that we may be godly and yet not see God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may be complete and entire concerning Christian conduct, but we may not know how to fight the battle to carry out God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, I am burdened to emphasize the importance of being balanced in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to see God s economy, and we need to be perfected in our daily personal life so that we may be complete and entire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need both the balance and the warning found in the book of James.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Regarding this book, we need to be fair, recognizing that the entrance of Paul s Epistles still needs the help of the door of the book of James.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>RESISTING TEMPTATION BY THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1:2-12 we considered the first item of the practical virtues of Christian perfection covered in this book enduring trials by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1:13-18 we come to a second item resisting temptation as God-born ones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verses 13 through 18 the first matter is resisting temptation, and the second is God s bringing us forth through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has caused us to have a new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through any kind of birth, life is always imparted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When God regenerated us, causing us to have a divine birth, the divine life was imparted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In these verses there is the implication that we resist temptation by the divine life we received in our divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the title of this section is Resisting Temptation as God-born Ones.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because we have been born of God, we are now the children of God possessing God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This divine life is the means, the capital, for us to resist temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The divine life has been deposited into us, and thus we have the ability, energy, strength, and power to resist temptation.</S>
