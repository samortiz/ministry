Only the processed and consummated Triune God living in us as the all-inclusive Spirit can be a Christian. What the New Testament requires of us is too high. The kind of holiness required, for example, is something that we cannot produce. We praise the Lord that it is not we who need to fulfill the New Testament requirements but the Spirit in us who fulfills them. Instead of doing things in ourselves, we should simply enjoy His living and His working. Only the Spirit can be a Christian, and only the Spirit can be an overcomer. Remember, the Spirit is our God, our Father, our Lord, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Shepherd, and our life and life supply.</P><P>The Spirit is everything to us to live the Christian life. The Christian life is altogether the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit. In this Spirit we have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In this Spirit we are in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). What kind of God do we have today? Our God is the processed and consummated Triune God, who is the consummated, all-inclusive Spirit as everything for our Christian life. When we have a need or a disability, we can remind Him of it. When we are facing a difficult situation, we can talk to Him about it. Then He, the One who lives in us, will come in to face the situation and to do whatever is needed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MARRIAGE OF THE CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD<br>AND THE GLORIFIED TRIPARTITE MAN</H2><P>In Acts 2 we see the pouring out of the consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit upon God's chosen people. At the end of the Bible we have the expression "the Spirit and the bride" (Rev. 22:17). Who are these two? The Spirit is the consummated Triune God, and the bride is the regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified tripartite man. Eventually, the consummated Triune God and the glorified tripartite man will be married and become one in life, in nature, in element, and in essence. This will be a corporate entity&#151;the New Jerusalem as the aggregate of the mingling of divinity and humanity to express the Triune God for eternity. Today's church life should be a miniature of the marvelous New Jerusalem.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
