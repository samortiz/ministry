How should we deal with our children? First we have to choose God for them. Freedom of religion can be practiced only after they have moved away from home. As long as they are at home, we have to choose their faith for them. We have to be firm in our attitude on the one hand and gentle on the other hand. The mistake that fathers often make toward their children is provoking them to anger. Ephesians 6:4 says that the fathers should not provoke their children to anger. As the head we have the authority, but we must not provoke our children to anger. Except for Colossians 3, this is the only place in the Bible that teaches how to be a father. It is easy to be a father foolishly, but exercising authority and firmly dealing with children is not that easy; the children can easily rebel. This is why we must learn.</p><h2 class="head2">Being a Pattern, Nurturing Up the Children</h2><p>Ephesians 6:4 also mentions nurturing. This means bringing up someone. Suppose I asked Brother Wu to bring a letter to someone. This is different from sending a letter to someone. Bringing a letter is having a person go with a letter, whereas sending a letter is having the letter go without the person. Suppose you bring your son to Amoy. You are going together with your son. This is different from sending your son to Amoy. The Bible says that we should "bring up" our children with the Lord's Word. This means that the fathers have to take the lead in the teachings and the Word of God. Many fathers do not bring up their children; they hope that their children will not do certain things, yet they do the same things themselves. This is sending up; this is not bringing up. Asking your children to follow your teachings while not practicing them yourself will not work. You have to bring them up until they are grown up. You have to be their pattern. Whatever you want them to be, you must first be yourself. This is the way to deal with children.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO DEAL WITH SLAVES</h2><p>Ephesians 6:5 goes on to deal with the question of the slaves. It says, "Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ." Whether or not a person is a believer, he is either a servant or a master. If you have an unbeliever as your master, you must obey him. If you have a brother as your master, you have a double responsibility towards him. On the one hand, you have to serve your Lord. On the other hand, you have to serve your brother who is your master.</p><p>Many families find it difficult to hire brothers and sisters as servants. I would think that saints would do a better job than outsiders, but many brothers today would not hire believers to work for them. This is a shame. Those who are servants should serve their masters well. If I had to travel and needed a tent, I would surely have bought it from Paul in Corinth. I would surely want his signature to be on the tent that I bought. If Paul could not make better tents than others, I would not read his epistles. His needlework had to be good and his craftsmanship excellent. This is the way the servants have to be; they must do a better job than those in the world could do. At the same time, masters must know how to be masters. They must be loving, gentle, and humble towards their servants, and they must honor them. They must be firm in their attitude. If the servants do something wrong, they must ask them to do it over again. If they let them get by one time, the servants will not do a good job the next time. Whether you are a master or a servant, you have to be one "from the soul," knowing that each one will receive back what he has done, whether he is a slave or a free man, and also knowing that both their Master and yours is in the heavens; there is no respect of persons with Him (vv. 8-9).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
