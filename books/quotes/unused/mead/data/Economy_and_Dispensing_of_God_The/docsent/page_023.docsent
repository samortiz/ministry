   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THROUGH INCARNATION CHRIST AS THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD COMING TO BE A MAN WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AS GRACE AND REALITY FOR THE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY THAT MEN MAY RECEIVE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE FULLNESS OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John's Gospel the matter of dispensing is very striking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although we cannot find the word dispensing there, the matter of dispensing is implied very much in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 1:14 tells us that the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Word is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Word became flesh to dispense God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Incarnation is for dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If God had never become incarnated, He would have remained in His divinity, and there would have been no way for Him to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Incarnation was the initiation of the divine dispensing; it was the first step of God's dispensing of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God was incarnated, He came full of grace and reality John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not come empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In incarnation God came in fullness; He came full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Grace is God enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is nothing less than God as our portion for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we enjoy God, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Grace is not an expensive car or a big house; these things Paul counted as dung Phil 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Grace is the very God Himself, subjectively enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Reality is God gained by us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the entire universe, nothing is real.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Solomon told us that everything is vanity Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Houses and cars are vanity; they are not reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only God gained by us is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His incarnation God came to us full of grace and reality for us to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 1:16 says, "For of His fullness we all received."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's fullness is His rich grace plus His rich reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we go to the kitchen at dinner time, we can see a fullness there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fullness may include beef, fish, melons, and many other kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the fullness of the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we come to Jesus and call upon His name, within His name there is a fullness; this fullness is grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus did not come empty-handed; He came with the fullness of the riches of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The riches of the Triune God are just Himself as grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we all can receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, without dispensing we cannot receive Him, because receiving is based on dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If I do not speak, how can others hear?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If God does not dispense, how can we receive Him?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the incarnated God, He is ready to dispense all that He is into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is dispensing Himself as grace and reality to His believers so that all His believers can receive Him again and again every day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The time of morning revival is a time for receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a time to eat Christ and drink Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we come to the Lord's table, we come to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we pray, we are actually breathing in the Lord, and this again is a receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It may seem as if we are merely praying, but actually we are receiving the living Lord as our water, food, air, and everything we need.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On God's side, He is dispensing and distributing Himself; on our side, we are receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every day our Christian life is one of receiving the dispensing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I did not receive anything from God, I would have nothing to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While I am speaking, I am also receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a kind of transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the one hand, while I am speaking, I am dispensing; on the other hand, while I am speaking, I am also receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My dispensing comes from my receiving of His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Christian work is a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we preach the gospel by knocking on doors, we should not trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, we should pray that when we open our mouth, while we are speaking, the Lord would supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then, between us and the Lord there will be a transmission, and that transmission will enter into others and they will receive Christ.</S>
