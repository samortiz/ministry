   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-EIGHT THE VERDICT OF DEATH 1 Date: November 18, 1941</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: 7 Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:8-10 DEALING WITH THE NATURAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must realize that a Christian possesses everything that he should receive at the time of his regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through regeneration a Christian receives a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God does not mend the natural life; He does not repair the old life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The natural life and the old life are the very sphere of the cross's operation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's intention is to give the natural life and the old life a fundamental and final blow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Esau was a sinner who was moral, whereas Jacob was a supplanter who feared God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He wanted spiritual blessings and God's presence but was very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He did not deny himself, and his maneuvering, energy, and cleverness were always with him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why God had to give him a fundamental blow at Peniel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Any blow from God that allows us to resume our former condition cannot be considered a fundamental blow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jacob sought for blessing, yet he had to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wanted to be the firstborn, yet he had to leave his family and parents.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After God touched the hollow of his thigh at Peniel, he became lame forever.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From that point on, he limped whenever he moved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The strength of his natural life was thoroughly dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people receive revelation and light after they have been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the degree of the power that is produced from this touch depends on how deeply God has touched us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need God's light to expose our true nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once it is exposed, we are no longer able to return to or recover our old condition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what we mean by a fundamental blow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A fundamental dealing means that there is no returning to our former condition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE VERDICT OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone has to pass through death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As soon as a man is born, he is heading in the direction of death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But before death actually comes to a man, he may not feel the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He may never have thought of death until a doctor tells him that he is terminally ill with tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then there is an immediate "verdict of death."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This does not mean that there was no death prior to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It merely means that he did not see the imminence and reality of death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when he sees it, he is crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people know the doctrine of the cross, and they can even preach it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nevertheless, the cross is a fuzzy subject to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But once God touches them and they hear the verdict of death, the cross becomes real to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once God touches a man, he becomes crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Lameness is a mark of God's drastic operation on man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>GOD'S DOCTRINES VERSUS GOD'S LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is a great difference between God's doctrines and God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jacob met God; he was touched by Him, dealt with by Him, and became lame.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Acting lame does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who act lame may limp when they think about it, but when they are fighting to get on a bus, they forget about their "lameness."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This kind of "lameness" is only a change in conduct; it is not a change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who are truly lame can do nothing but limp.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Neither those who are running nor those who are pretending to be lame have been touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's children today are filled with behavior because podiums are filled with doctrines, and doctrines produce nothing but artificial behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have seen God crippling men who were quite strong, and I believe that He can cripple us too.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He will take away our confidence in ourselves so that we will no longer trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the verdict of death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A day will come when God will deal with us in a severe way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He will pronounce a verdict of death on us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we will be able to say that everything is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What we have today is not of God, and what we had before was not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But when we are touched this way, our denial of the self will be spontaneous, and our prayer will flow out in a most unpretentious way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who are touched by God do not need to set anything to memory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who are truly lame may forget about their lameness, but as soon as they take a step and try to walk as others do, they find that they are crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They fall at the first step.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our mind may forget that we are lame, but our legs will never forget that we are lame.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The cross is God's greatest destruction; it has destroyed the whole old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This destruction comes from the operation of light, and this drastic work forever removes any hope of recovery.</S>
