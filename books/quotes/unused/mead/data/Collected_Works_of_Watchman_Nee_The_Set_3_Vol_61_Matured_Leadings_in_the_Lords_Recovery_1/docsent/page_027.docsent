   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ADVANCEMENT IN CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Chu Chen once occupied a certain position in a certain denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later he received God's light and saw His way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He gave up his position and started a small coal shop.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although he worked hard, he was joyful because he obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He became stronger in his consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His spiritual condition advanced, and he ascended to a higher plane.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may owe others in many things, and we may even owe others in spiritual things, such as our love one for another Rom 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, in consecration we should owe nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In consecration we should only advance; we should not step back.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times the elders are affected by their past experience when they deal with the matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They carefully weigh everything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are not like the young brothers and sisters who consecrate themselves with a burning zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is true that the elders need to make some decisions and arrangements with regard to the saints' consecration, but if the elders only move according to experience and caution out of a fear of being too extreme in their consecration, they cannot serve as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not be afraid of being too extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How many extreme things have we done in the past?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why are we so afraid of being extreme when it comes to the matter of consecration alone?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>DEALING WITH SPIRITUAL FEELINGS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of us have to go through dealings in our feelings, but how should we deal with our feelings?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a man has not dealt with a matter thoroughly, he will not have proper feelings concerning that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, one man in the Anglican Church by the name of H. C. Moule was touched deeply with the matter of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He picked up a proper feeling for the matter of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis, however, who was very spiritual and who rendered many people, including myself, much spiritual help through her writings, was prevented by her Quaker background from having a right feeling concerning the matter of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She has not passed through any dealing in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Concerning our feeling for every spiritual thing, we have to inquire of the Lord, and we have to open ourselves to His dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the matter of consecration, we have to ask the Lord, "Have I fully consecrated myself?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is there any area that I have not yet consecrated?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same thing can be said about our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should ask the Lord, "Is there any area in which I am still disobedient to You?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not have any preconceived idea about a matter, the Lord will give us the light and we will develop a proper feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brother Yu left the matter of his son's salvation completely to the judgment of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although he did his part in preaching to his son, he did not make any judgment on the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some people think that since they have given physical birth to their son, they should be responsible for their second birth as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They want to monopolize both births.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if they do this, they will damage their feelings before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should be tender in our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should always stand on the ground of a learner.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If spiritual authority is not on our shoulder, we should be humble to learn all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Isaiah prophesied of our Lord's time on earth, saying that He had the tongue of the instructed 50:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How humble the Lord was!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not stand on the ground of a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He did not speak His own words but the Father's word John 14:10, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to learn from the Lord's example.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we speak, we should say that we are not speaking from ourselves, but we are quoting Brother So-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE WORK SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Presently the work in south China and Southeast Asia should be concentrated in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hong Kong should be the center.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, we must have a breakthrough in Hong Kong before we can move on to Manila or Singapore.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I feel that it is too early for some co-workers to work in these two places.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Doing so would reduce our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once our strength is reduced, our work becomes burdensome.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The principle of God's work is first the one accord and then the concentration of our efforts in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we combine forces together, the result will be great.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the principle of the Bible, five men can chase a hundred, while a hundred can chase ten thousand Lev 26:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the first church was raised up, all the apostles were together in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After the church in Jerusalem became strong, the believers moved out for the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When one delivers a message, he is speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is important to have a strong spirit instead of good arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For this reason, our speaking should not pay too much attention to rational analysis.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The basis of God's ministry of the word is His revelation in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A minister of the word has to stand on the right ground; he has to be in spirit before he can minister the word to others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When I was at Honor Oak, I fellowshipped with Mr. Austin-Sparks about the matter of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We discussed the one unique ministry and the many ministries in the Epistles to the Corinthians 2 Cor 3:8; 1 Cor 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I said that perhaps the two passages in the Bible that will be the last to be fulfilled are the building up of the church, the Body of Christ, in Ephesians 4 and the church becoming holy and without blemish in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God's work today is to build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, there is the need of the one unique ministry that builds up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this Body there are many ministries that are for the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These are the ministries that the members of the Body receive from the Head for ministering to all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have to learn to take our stand and be restricted by the Body.</S>
