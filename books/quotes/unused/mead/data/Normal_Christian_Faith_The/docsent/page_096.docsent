   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW IS FOR EXPOSING MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need a word of explanation here.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why did God give us the law?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit of God gave the answer through the words of Paul: "The law entered in alongside that the offense might abound" Rom 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of the presence of sin, the law was added.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul also told us that the law exposes man's sins Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, the purpose of the law is not to remove our sins, but rather to reveal them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the law is for the removal of sins, then we have to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the law is not intended for that.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is there to expose us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"The law entered in alongside" for the purpose of showing us our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God knows very clearly what kind of people we are.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He knows all too well our weaknesses and corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He realizes that our conduct and behavior are such that even if we wanted to do good, we could not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Inwardly, we are corrupted; outwardly, we are degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The root problem is that we do not merely have an evil behavior but an evil life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here is the problem: God knows our wickedness, but we are ignorant of it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He realizes our utter depravity, but we have not given up hope in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We think that if we could be a little stronger or have a little more will power, we could obey God's words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Or we may think that what we lack is more effort, higher doctrines, or some other kind of help from God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We think that we can do something, but God knows that we can do nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason God gave man a long list of laws, not for man to keep, but rather to break.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way man will be exposed by his evil and realize that salvation can never come by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God knows us all too well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we do not know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God knows that we are only little children, and running the way we do, we will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet we do not realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, we fall, and then we believe that we are fallible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, the Bible says that the law has shut us all up under sin Gal 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Throughout the centuries, God has been teaching us one lesson, that we would know the impossibility of keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can never make it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>None of the commandments are there for us to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are all there for us to break.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result is that we would come to know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we know ourselves, we will say, "O God, I quit!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now I know what You want to do with me!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>WHAT TO DO?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Christ was on the earth, a young Israelite came to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This man was a very noble and refined person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He asked, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Luke 18:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On that day, the Lord did not tell him what we are used to hearing, that if he believed in Him he would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, He said, "You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother'" v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After the young man heard this, he said confidently, "All these things I have kept from my youth" v. 21 . The Lord knew that he did not know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He said, "Still you lack one thing."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems as if He was saying, "So you think you are perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let's see if this is the case or not."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He continued, "All that you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me" v. 22 . How did the young man react to these words? He began to realize that what God requires he could never fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This additional item was something he could not do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So he left sorrowfully.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He needed to know himself; he needed to realize that he was unable.</S>
