   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As a Lamb Without Blemish and Spot</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Peter, Christ is a lamb without blemish and spot 1 Pet 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This also is for life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are sinful, and unless there is such a lamb without blemish and spot, our sins could never be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, Christ s redemption according to 1 Peter 1:18 is not just to redeem us from sin or from hell, but to redeem us from our vain manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His blood redeems us from our vain and corrupted life that we may live a godly life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How could we live a godly life if we did not have a godly life?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How could we have a godly life except through Christ s redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By this view you can see that even Christ being a lamb without blemish and spot is for life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a Living Stone</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peter ministered Christ as a living stone 1 Pet 2:4, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A living stone doesn t mean only a stone of life, but a stone which is living, acting, and working.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The very Christ who lives in you is such a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have a piece of living stone within you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 6 tells us that He is the living bread v. 51 . He is not only the bread of life, but also the living bread, the bread that lives in you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The food we take into our stomach is living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After a few hours it becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the food were not living it could not get into our blood and into our cells.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we eat a piece of stone, it will remain within us as a dead stone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the bread is on the table, it is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When it gets into us, it becomes the living bread.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Could you see the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Where is Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Outside of us He is the stone of life, but inside of us He becomes the living stone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ as a stone is organic and living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can become a living stone because this living stone has been dispensed into us and lives in us to make us living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By this we can see that Christ is a living stone to dispense life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the Shepherd and Overseer of our Souls</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus is the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls 1 Pet 2:25; 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we have mentioned previously the main point in taking care of the sheep is to feed them so that they may have more life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So the shepherding is also for life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The purpose of the overseer is to watch over the sheep so that they would not be hurt or carried away.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The shepherd first takes care of us to feed us and eventually becomes our overseer to keep us always under the life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every item of what Christ is, is a life-dispensing matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever Christ is, is for life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE BELIEVERS PRODUCED</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The result of all the life dispensing by what Christ is, is that the believers are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First they are chosen by God 1 Pet 2:9a .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second, they are redeemed with the precious blood of Christ 1 Pet 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are chosen and redeemed to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then they are sanctified, or separated, to receive life 1 Pet 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Finally, they are regenerated of the incorruptible seed of God to receive life 1 Pet 1:3, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On God s side regeneration is to dispense life, and on our side it is to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all have been regenerated of the incorruptible seed of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the Word of life, which is really life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The divine life is the incorruptible seed of which we all have been born.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As those who have been born of the incorruptible seed we are newborn babes who long for the guileless milk of the word 1 Pet 2:2, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Newborn babes only know how to do one thing, and that is to take milk.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They don t know how to improve their behavior, and they don t know how to care for their character.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They only care for the milk.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They don t even know the word milk, but something in their nature longs for the milk.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Right after regeneration we become the newborn babes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to long for the guileless milk of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every day and all the time we need to get into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Word there is the milk.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When a little baby is not happy, it means he is short of milk.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When you are not so happy, it means you have not taken any milk from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When I get into the Word I get into the milk, and my face is so broad and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When you have just a little time of morning watch in the Word, you will come out of your room with your face shining.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As newborn babes you need the milk for growing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By growing we become the living stones to be built up a spiritual house, into a holy and royal priesthood 1 Pet 2:5, 9; 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the result of the life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It makes us living stones for the building up of God s spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This spiritual house is a body of priests, a holy and royal priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices to God and to tell out the virtues of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Through regeneration of the life of God, we also become the flock of God which is always receiving the life nourishment from the Shepherd 1 Pet 5:2 , and heirs of the grace of life, inheriting all the riches of life 1 Pet 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then we become stewards of the varied grace of God 1 Pet 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We become not only heirs of grace to receive grace, but also stewards of grace to minister grace to others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because we are so full of grace, we become stewards of grace to serve others with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even your serving others with grace is a kind of life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In our Christian life, we all are stewards.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You are a steward to me, and I am a steward to you.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You minister life to me, and I minister life to you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is a mutual dispensing among us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Actually our fellowship with one another is a mutual life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>By this kind of life dispensing we are partaking of and enjoying what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is to partake of God s divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For this purpose God has given us all things relating to life and godliness 2 Pet 1:3 , and also given us precious and exceedingly great promises 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To partake of God s divine nature is to enjoy God s life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Eventually we will be perfected, established, strengthened, and grounded by God s life dispensing, that we may be brought into God s eternal glory 1 Pet 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Without God dispensing Himself into us as life, we could never be perfected, strengthened, established, grounded, and brought into God s eternal glory.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>That is the ultimate issue of God s dispensing of life.</S>
