<p>Hymn #791 in our hymnal is very suitable for the new way of meeting today. In this hymn there are three important points. The first point is to burn the incense, that is, to pray. The second point is to light the lamp, that is, to be enlightened by the word in the Bible, or to read the Word. The third point is to sing praises to the Lord. In the Chinese version of this hymn, the last phrase of the chorus can also be rendered &ldquo;Always speaking before the Lord.&rdquo; However, in the Chinese there is a unique rhyme throughout the entire hymn, and if the word &ldquo;praising&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;speaking,&rdquo; the rhyme is spoiled. I point this out to you to show you that concerning the things of the Lord, we need to study more.</p>
