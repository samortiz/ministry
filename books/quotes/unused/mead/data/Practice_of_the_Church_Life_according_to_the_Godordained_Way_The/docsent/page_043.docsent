   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The standard of speaking in the church meetings is the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To speak in the meetings, we must exercise our spirit, our mouth, our voice, our speed, our gesture, and our accent in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To play basketball, in contrast, is a small thing, yet even for such a small thing, the players must exercise and practice every day for many hours.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How much more do we need to practice speaking in the meetings!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Christian meeting requires a high practice, because the Christian life is a high enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Often, however, we despise the Christian life and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must remember that when we meet together or contact people by visiting them that we are carrying out our kingly duty.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Matthew 28:19, the Lord Jesus as the King-Savior charged us, saying, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we contact others, we must speak in a way that fulfills the Father's heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This explains why there is a result when some brothers and sisters contact people, and why there is little result when other saints contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the God-ordained way to practice the church life, we all have to learn to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some may think that the New Testament does not teach us how to speak, but this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 5:19 says, "Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To speak in such a way is not a natural way of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To speak in a natural way does not fulfill a spiritual purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we must learn to speak in a trained way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our learning to speak for the Lord for the building up of the church never ceases.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many times after I gave a message, I had some regret because I felt that my speaking was not up to the proper standard.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1933, the second year after we began to have the Lord's table in Chefoo, Brother Nee came to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some in the denominations heard about Brother Nee's visit and invited him to speak in a meeting of a conference they were holding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Nee went to that meeting and spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to my feeling, he gave a good message, but when he came back to my home after the meeting, I noticed that he was not very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, he indicated to me that he felt his speaking was poor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows that our learning to speak in a meeting for the Lord is endless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we can be successful in speaking for the Lord, the church will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The way that we speak is important.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In a hymn the rhythm is more important than the rhyme.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the same in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With some brothers, their voice, or sound, is good, but their speaking may be short of rhythm.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there is not the proper rhythm, our speaking will be difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, there is the need of a few "selahs," that is, a few short stops, when we exercise our voice to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the fellowship in this message, we can see that we need instruction, learning, and exercise to speak for the Lord in the most effective way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we pay attention to all the points in this message, our meetings will be greatly enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we speak in a natural way, this will frustrate, cool down, kill, or annul the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all have to learn how to avoid the shortcomings which we have pointed out in this message and exercise our entire being to speak for the Lord for the building up of the church.</S>
