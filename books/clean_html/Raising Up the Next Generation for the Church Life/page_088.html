<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>If you want to help the young people, you must have an interest in them:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Do not find their faults at first; if you do, you cannot help them&mdash;Luke 9:55; Matt. 18:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Some have a special liking for the young people whom they consider good, but they purse their mouths and shake their heads when they see those whom they think are not good; this is wrong.</li>
		<li>Oftentimes God will prove to us that our evaluation of those whom we think are good is inaccurate; instead, those whom we consider not good may be greatly used by God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Regardless of whether the young people are good or bad, we need to treat everyone the same, and we need to like them and be concerned for them:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Play a game with them, and then talk to them about the Lord Jesus when the game is over; this is genuine capability.</li>
		<li>However, if you cannot talk to them about the Lord Jesus because He is gone after you play ball, then your spirituality is false.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we want to help the young people, we need to be interested in them; do not be concerned first about their mistakes, and do not condemn them at all&mdash;cf. Luke 24:13-35.</li>
	<li>We should give the young people the feeling that we are their good friend, that we sympathize with them, and that we are interested in them and in their affairs.</li>
	<li>We all need to have the loving and forgiving heart of the Father God and the shepherding and seeking spirit of our Savior Christ&mdash;15:20, 4; 2 Tim. 1:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Do not classify people, because no one can tell what they will become.</li>
		<li>The spirit that God has given us is a spirit of love&mdash;v. 7.</li>
		<li>The church is not a police station to arrest people or a law court to condemn people, but a loving home, a hospital and a school.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Learn to contact the young people; helping the young brothers and sisters depends not on our ability to give them messages but on our regular, frequent contacts with them; remember not to talk about spiritual things at the initial contact with them:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When you contact the young brothers and sisters, do not begin by asking, &ldquo;How many chapters of the Bible have you read today? Have you prayed?&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Such questions should not be brought up until you have had many contacts with them, maybe even after eight or ten times.</li>
	<li>If you do it prematurely, it is easy to cause a negative reaction; if you mess up the whole thing, he may not receive the Lord for his entire lifetime.</li>
	<li>Do not stir up his negative feeling by talking to him right away about reading the Bible or praying.</li>
	<li>You must wait until you have more contacts with him and he feels that he likes you and that you also like him.</li>
	<li>Once you have touched his feeling and earned his trust, then you can begin to talk about spiritual things.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Emphasize practicality instead of stressing doctrines; when helping the young people, give them something practical:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We should not put too much emphasis on doctrines, not only when we have personal contact with them but also when we are preaching the gospel or giving messages to them:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we give them only some doctrines and they come only to listen, there will not be much effect.</li>
		<li>The more we speak doctrines, the more the young people become dead, cold, and backsliding.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because young people have many practical problems, we need to sense their feelings, beginning with these problems:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to spend some time to study the problems of the young people in their practical living, including problems both before and after their salvation.</li>
		<li>Based upon our studies, when we preach the gospel or speak a word of edification to them, what we speak is practical and is related to the practical matters that we have touched in their lives.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
