<h2 class=head3>Source, Expression, Realization</h2><p>Concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, we are using three crucial words: source, expression, and realization. The source is the Father, and the Son is the expression of the Father as the source. Furthermore, the Spirit is the realization of the Son as the Father’s expression, and this realization is ultimate, consummate. The consummation of the Triune God is not solely the Spirit; this consummation is the Spirit as the realization of the Son, who is the expression of the Father as the source. Therefore, here we have the realization, the expression, and the source.<p>Neither the Father as the source nor the Son as the expression can reach us in an ultimate way. As the source, the Father cannot reach us at all. As the expression of the Father, the Son can reach us in an objective way, but He cannot reach us in a subjective way. To say that the Son cannot reach us in a subjective way means that He can be among us or with us but not in us, apart from the Spirit. In order for the Son as the expression of the Father to reach us subjectively, that is, to enter into us to dwell in us, there is the need of the Spirit. As the realization of the Son, the Spirit enters into us to be experienced, enjoyed, and possessed by us. Furthermore, the Spirit as the realization of the Son becomes one with us in our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This is the entering in of the Triune God into us.<p>When the Spirit enters into us, the Son comes with the Spirit, and the Father comes in the Son. This means that when the Spirit as the realization reaches us, enters into us, and becomes one with us in our spirit, the entire Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—is in us. When the realization, the Spirit, becomes our portion and enjoyment, we also have the source, the Father, and the expression, the Son. Along with the realization, both the source and the expression are in us. Therefore, once we possess the Spirit as the realization, we also possess the Son as the expression and the Father as the source. In other words, if we have the Spirit, we have all Three of the Triune God— the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The entire Triune God dwells within us.<p>By the Lord’s mercy I can testify that daily I experience the realization of the Triune God. Daily and hourly I have the Father as the source, the Son as the expression, and the Spirit as the realization. I enjoy the Spirit, the Son, and the Father, and I experience the Triune God dispensing Himself into me. Day by day the Triune God is dispensed into me for my experience and enjoyment. As a result, my daily life is the realization of the Triune God, and this realization is the all-inclusive Spirit. Therefore, the all-inclusive Spirit is the full realization of the Triune God.<h2 class=head3>For Dispensing and Mingling</h2><p>We are not only being filled with the Triune God; we are also immersed into Him. For us to be filled with Him means that He is within us; for us to be immersed into Him means that we are in Him. This is the real mingling with the Triune God. Continually the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us, and we are being immersed into Him in order to be mingled with Him.<p>As He mingles Himself with us, simultaneously He makes us one unit with Him. In this way He makes us an abode of the Father’s house. All the abodes of the Father’s house are branches of the universal vine revealed in John 15. Hence, the vine is the Father’s house, and the branches of the vine are the abodes of the Father’s house. If we realize this, we should say, “Hallelujah, I am one of the abodes of the Father’s house and one of the branches in the vine!”<p>What makes it possible for us to be abodes of the Father’s house and branches in the vine? This is not possible by what we are naturally, by what we are in our natural being. We can become abodes of the Father’s house and branches of the universal vine only by being mingled with the Triune God. We need the Spirit as the realization of the Triune God to fill us and saturate us, and we need to be immersed in this Spirit. Then the Spirit will be one with us, and we shall be one with the Spirit. In this way, our regenerated being and the Spirit become one entity, and this entity is an abode of the Father’s house and a branch in the universal vine. As those who have the Triune God in them, we become abodes of the Father’s house and branches in the vine. How wonderful! We become abodes and branches through the Triune God dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us.
