   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Then, we need to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all are wrapped up with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have discovered through my travels that all young people are the same in loving the world, regardless of their race or nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They were never taught to love the world, but spontaneously they know how to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of this, all the young people are old.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They all need to be subjectively sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, sanctification is still inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After being sanctified, we need to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the biblical sense, to be renewed is to have a new element added into our being to replace and discharge our old element.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the process of metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to have such a metabolic renewing, another element must be added to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the whole universe only God could be a new element that can be added into our being to replace our old element.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, we need to receive God into our being that we may be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every part of our being is old, dirty, and sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because our mind is old, dirty, and sinful, we have many thoughts during the day that we dare not tell others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every part of our being needs to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We not only need to be washed; we need to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Washing only takes away the dirt, but it does not bring a new element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only the renewing carried out by God brings in a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some of the ethical teachers and philosophers, such as Confucius, taught their followers that they must be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the people who received their teaching had to renew themselves by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These people received many teachings concerning renewing, but they did not receive an element that could renew them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The New Testament teaching concerning renewing, however, stresses that the Holy Spirit accomplishes the renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This renewing is not carried out by the Holy Spirit's working on us this is the natural, human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Holy Spirit renews us by infusion and by dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In my youth I learned the Chinese ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, I came to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While studying the Bible, the thoughts of Chinese ethics troubled me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I found out that ethics does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only the Spirit works.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, He does not work; He simply adds Himself as an element into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The renewing that is according to the New Testament is accomplished by adding a new element into the believers' being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Chemistry is mainly a work of combining different elements together in order to obtain a certain compound.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, chemistry depends on elements.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When two elements are added together, a certain reaction takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the work of chemistry, and this is also a picture of renewing by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is wise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not do a lot of work; rather, He simply put His divine element as life into our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This divine element is God Himself consummated to be the life-giving, indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the Spirit, He gives life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This life is a strong divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's element, the strongest element, is the element of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For God to put His life into us is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible uses grafting to illustrate the organic process of renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a branch from one tree is grafted to another tree, one life is put into another life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These two lives are two elements.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When these two elements are put together, a biochemical reaction takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is something organic; it is not a matter of work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In John 15 the Lord Jesus said that He is the vine and we are the branches vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>1, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Romans 11 Paul said that we, the Gentiles, are not the natural branches of the vine v. 24 , but we were wild olive branches v. 17 . One day God's mercy reached us and transferred us into Christ, and we were grafted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through such a grafting another element entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I look to the Lord that in His church we will all learn to teach these things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To teach husbands to love their wives and wives to submit to their husbands does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to teach others the way to have God as the divine element dispensed into them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When husbands have more of God dispensed into them, they will surely love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They will even love their enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Day by day we not only need cleansing, washing, and purging; we also need renewing by the dispensing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
