   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 4 says that this designation was according to the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The illustration of a carnation seed will help us understand the meaning of this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When a carnation seed is put into the soil, the seed dies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But this death prepares the way for resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, the seed sprouts and grows into a mature plant that produces carnation flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the carnation plant blossoms, it is designated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The carnation flower is the designation of the carnation seed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A carnation seed is designated, not by being labeled, but by being buried into the ground and by growing into a blossoming carnation plant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that the carnation seed is designated according to the life which is within it; that is, it is designated according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I put a stone into some soil, nothing will happen because there is no life in the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But after a carnation seed is placed in the earth, it will be designated according to the life within it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same principle, when Christ was resurrected from among the dead, He was designated in power by resurrection according to the Spirit of holiness that was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now He is the Son of God in a way that is more wonderful than before, for now He has both the divine nature and the resurrected, transformed, uplifted, glorified, and designated human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the Son of God with both divinity and humanity, Christ is now the pattern and model for the mass production of the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen that God does not want just one Son, the only begotten Son; He desires many sons, all of whom are the mass production of the Firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter one we have the pattern, but in chapter eight we have the mass production.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Chapter eight clearly reveals that the only begotten Son has become the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>HOW THE MANY SONS ARE BROUGHT INTO BEING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we need to consider how these many sons are brought into being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The key to understanding this is in 1:3 and 4.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In these verses there are a number of crucial terms: according to flesh, according to the Spirit, the Spirit of holiness, power, resurrection, and Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a sense, the entire book of Romans is structured around these phrases.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verses 3 and 4 of chapter one actually summarize the whole book.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The book of Romans is a record of sinners in the flesh becoming sons of God in power and by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 3:20 we read that by the works of law no flesh shall be justified before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that the flesh, the fallen man, is hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapter seven reveals how ugly and troublesome the flesh is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapter eight then describes the utter inability of the flesh to keep the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before we were saved, we were just flesh; we were hopeless, troublesome, and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and in His crucifixion He brought this flesh to the cross and terminated it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the flesh, we cannot be designated sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can only become sons of God according to the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As believers in Christ, we have both the flesh, which we received of our natural parents, and the Spirit of holiness, who has been given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Like the Lord Jesus, we also have two natures, the human nature and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we can boldly say, Lord Jesus, You have two natures, and we have two natures also.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You were made flesh, and we also are flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Within You there was the Spirit of holiness, and within us there is the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Oh, within us we have the Spirit of holiness, who is actually the wonderful Person of Christ Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Holiness is the substance, the essence, the element, the nature, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This holy nature of God is absolutely different from all other things and separate from them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit of holiness refers to God s very essence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, by having the Spirit of holiness, we have God s substance within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to this Spirit, we are being designated the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>GRAFTED INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As believers, we have been grafted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose a branch from a poor tree is grafted into a better tree.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Through this process of grafting, the poor branch becomes a good branch, part of a good tree.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Having been grafted into Christ and into the likeness of His death, we are now undergoing the process of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to 1 Peter 1:3, we were regenerated by the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that we were born again when Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In a very real sense, we were born again before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we are experiencing the resurrection of what has already been resurrected and the release of what has already been released.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, we can say that we are in the process of being resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This concept is found in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He who raised Christ from among the dead gives us life through His Spirit who dwells in us v. 11 . This indicates that we are presently undergoing the process of resurrection.</S>
