   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR URGENT NEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE EXCELLENT KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Paul was still in Judaism, he was blind to the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ existed as the all-extensive One, but Paul was totally ignorant of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time, Paul had a thorough and excellent knowledge of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But one day, as he was on the road to Damascus, Christ appeared to him, called to him, and said, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although Paul did not know Christ and was blind to Christ, he was nevertheless persecuting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the Lord was revealed to him and he was converted, scales fell from his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His eyes having been opened, he began to see Christ and to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more he saw Christ, the more he received the knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the reason he speaks in Philippians 3:8 of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus his Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There surely is such a thing as the excellency of knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you testify that Christ is excellent but do so without having the knowledge of Him, you will be speaking merely according to tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually your word will be uttered in ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You will be speaking something you do not know, because you yourself have not received the excellent knowledge concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Unless we have the excellent knowledge of Christ, we cannot say that Christ is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We urgently need the excellent knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul was so desperate to have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ that he was willing to count all things loss on account of this knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Gaining the excellency of the knowledge of Christ may be illustrated by the experience of tourists shopping in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The merchants there know how to display their products, especially jade, in a way to make them very attractive to tourists.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Often when tourists see precious items on display, they become excited.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, they acquire a knowledge of the excellency of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before they entered the store, they did not know anything of the excellency of these precious items.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But once they saw them and gained the excellency of the knowledge concerning them, they were willing to pay the price to possess them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In like manner, we need a revelation of Christ s excellency, of His supreme preciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My burden in this message is not related to doctrine; my burden is that we see a vision and receive a revelation of the excellency of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have a revelation of Christ s excellency, we shall automatically have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is in 3:8, whereas the actual experience of Christ is in 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The knowledge of Christ, however, is basic.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By knowledge we actually mean a revelation, a vision, concerning Christ and His excellence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Paul was blind and in religion, he could not see Christ; he could see only the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, he had the excellency of the knowledge of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after Christ was revealed to him, he began to have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was captured by the excellency of knowing Christ, and for the sake of this knowledge, he was willing to drop all things and count them to be loss.</S>
