<h1 class="title">THE TYPE OF THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS SEEN IN THE TABERNACLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:23-24, 31; 30:1-3; 36:20-34</h1>
<p>The tabernacle portrayed in the Old Testament is a clear picture of the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Hence, if we want to know the progressive steps for building God&rsquo;s dwelling place, we must know the matters concerning the tabernacle.</p>
<p>The central significance of the tabernacle is God mingling with man so that in Him man may be built together into a corporate entity. The main structure of the tabernacle was boards of wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 26:15-30; 36:20-34). Gold signifies divinity, the divine nature, and wood signifies humanity, the human nature. Therefore, wood overlaid with gold signifies the mingling of divinity with humanity into one entity. This entity is a building, God&rsquo;s dwelling place (15:13; 25:8), which was the tabernacle and the temple in the Old Testament (40:34; 1 Kings 6:2; 8:1-13), which is the church in the New Testament (Matt. 16:18; 1 Tim. 3:15), and which ultimately will be the New Jerusalem (Rev. 3:12; 21:2). This corporate entity depends on the mingling of divinity with humanity. In other words, this dwelling place is composed of God mingled with man, and it is the mutual dwelling place of God and man. This is the central significance of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>In the tabernacle God did not dwell in the Holy Place, much less in the outer court. He dwelt in the Holy of Holies. Thus, when we speak of the tabernacle from God&rsquo;s perspective, we must begin in the Holy of Holies, pass through the Holy Place, and enter into the outer court. However, when we speak of the tabernacle from man&rsquo;s perspective, that is, according to our experience, we must begin in the outer court, pass through the Holy Place, and enter into the Holy of Holies. In this chapter and in the next we will go from man to God, that is, from the outer court to the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSTANTLY EXPERIENCING<br />
THE ALTAR AND THE LAVER</h2>
<p>There were two pieces of furniture in the outer court: the bronze altar and the bronze laver. The bronze used to cover the altar came from the bronze censers of the two hundred and fifty men who were judged and consumed by fire from God (Num. 16:37-39). Hence, the bronze altar reminded man of God&rsquo;s judgment. The bronze for the laver came from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting (Exo. 38:8). Hence, the bronze of the laver was able to reflect man&rsquo;s condition. Those who approached the bronze altar sensed God&rsquo;s judgment and were convicted of their corruption, evil, and sins. Furthermore, the blood of the sin offering was shed at the bronze altar, indicating that those whom God condemned were forgiven and redeemed. On the one hand, those who approached the bronze laver sensed that their true condition was exposed, but on the other hand, the water in the laver washed away their filth.</p>
<p>The bronze altar and the laver are always linked in our experience. When we come to the bronze altar, we confess our weaknesses, offenses, failures, defilements, and discord with God and are willing to be convicted and judged afresh in order to be cleansed. When we are cleansed and forgiven by God and redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, we will feel as though we are standing in front of a mirror that shows us our real condition. Prior to approaching the bronze altar and the laver, we could see only our strengths and believed that our attitude toward our parents, spouse, children, colleagues, and neighbors was good. But at the laver we see our real condition and discover that our attitude toward our parents, spouse, children, colleagues, and neighbors is not good. This is our experience of the shining and enlightening of the laver. At this point, we are not only forgiven of our offenses and washed of our stains; we are also delivered from the sin of disrespect in our actual living and from our improper attitude toward others. The laver puts our walk under the shining of the Holy Spirit so that our walk may be cleansed through the operation of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>This experience is not limited to our initial salvation. We experience this every time we are revived, that is, have a turn toward God. If we truly see that we are materials to be built with others into God&rsquo;s dwelling place, we will come to the bronze altar again and again to be judged and then cleansed by the precious blood of Christ and to enjoy the effectiveness of redemption on the cross. Not only so, through the shining of the bronze of God&rsquo;s judgment and the reflecting of the laver, we will be convicted and see that we are proud, not in one accord, lacking in forbearance, and unable to coordinate. The laver in the service meeting will show us that our speaking is from the self and that we cannot speak loosely any longer. This is the experience of being cleansed by the Holy Spirit in our words and deeds.</p>
<p>We experience the bronze altar and the laver every time we have a new spiritual beginning. When we have morning revival, we must first come to the bronze altar and the laver. Then we will be judged and convicted by the Lord, and we will sense that we are short in certain matters and toward certain persons. As a result, we will be willing to confess our wrongdoings and condemn our shortages in order to enjoy the effectiveness of redemption. After such an experience we will be more sensitive toward sin and sense that we cannot touch, utter, or think about certain things, nor can we have certain attitudes. We will be clear concerning many things before God. Through such experiences we are delivered from our weaknesses. This is what it means to experience the washing of the Holy Spirit, as typified by the laver.</p>
<p>We need to be under the intense shining of the Holy Spirit in order to see that our being built depends on our practical experience of the conviction and judgment of bronze at the altar and the exposing and shining of bronze at the laver. We need to experience the effectiveness of redemption at the bronze altar in order to have a thorough consecration and the cleansing of the laver in order to be delivered in our daily life from the things that cannot stand before the light, that is, the things that are obscure, unrighteous, or unclean. This is the preparatory work for the building.</p>
<p>We may be sloppy with our human affairs, but we cannot be sloppy about the building of the church. Anything that is sloppy, dark, corrupt, unrighteous, or unclean cannot be within the boundary of the hangings of the outer court. Even the matter of entering into the realm of the outer court requires that a person be judged and convicted under the shining of the Holy Spirit. Anything that does not agree with God&rsquo;s nature and is unacceptable to Him must be condemned. There is no room for sloppiness in the dwelling place of God, the church. This is a serious matter.</p>
<p>Solid churches have not been built up in some localities because the elders and responsible brothers have not been properly judged; they have not experienced the bronze altar or the laver. Sloppy men can never build up solid churches. We must have the hangings of fine white linen in our living. In order to work for the Lord, we cannot have a sloppy living or be unrighteous. If we are sloppy or unrighteous, the church where we serve will never be solid. Instead, it will collapse when the wind blows and will be damaged by the rain. In order to produce a solid church in a locality, the serving ones must first experience the judgment of the cross at the bronze altar.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Type, and Practice of the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
