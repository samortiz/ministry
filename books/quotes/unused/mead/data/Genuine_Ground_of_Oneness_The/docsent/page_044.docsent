   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A TYPE OF THE GENUINE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We thank the Lord that for nearly all the spiritual things in the New Testament there are types in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One of the types of genuine oneness is found in Deuteronomy 12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter the good land typifies the all-inclusive Christ, whereas the mountains, hills, and green trees typify various centers of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The offerings mentioned in this chapter typify various aspects of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yes, Deuteronomy 12 is a record of a charge given to the children of Israel upon entering into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the details of this charge are also types, not only instructions that were to be taken literally by God's people at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may use the Passover lamb as an illustration of something that has both a literal and typical significance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The very lamb that was slain at the time of the Passover was also a type of Christ as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same principle, the manna eaten by the children of Israel in the wilderness was a type of Christ as our heavenly food.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This principle also applies to the good land in Deuteronomy 12.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The land was not only a physical realm possessed by the children of Israel; it was also a type of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this chapter God's chosen people were commanded to go to the unique place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This place was selected in order to preserve the oneness of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This place was not only an actual location in the land of Canaan, but also a type of the genuine oneness of the believers in Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE CORPORATE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Psalm 133 the oneness of God's people is likened to the precious ointment and to the watering dew.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The precious ointment upon Aaron's head spread upon the beard and eventually went down to the skirts of his garment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This picture of oneness is related to a person, Aaron, a type of Christ in His priestly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the High Priest, Christ served God, accomplished God's purpose, and fulfilled the desire of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, in Psalm 133 Aaron typifies not only Christ Himself, but Christ with His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that here Aaron typifies the corporate Christ, the Head with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church in a very real sense is the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is thus a universal, great person with a number of aspects: the aspects of the Body, the Bride, the new man, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these aspects of the church are related to the person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE MANY LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Psalm 133 the oneness of God's people is also likened to the dew of Hermon that descends upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These mountains typify the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every local church is a mountain of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is one Zion, but many mountains signifying the many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a person, the church is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a place, the church, on the one hand, is the unique Zion; but, on the other hand, it is the many mountains of the one Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although there is one church in the universe, there are nevertheless many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Each local church is a peak among the many mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the person is universal, but the mountains are local.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our oneness is like the precious ointment upon Aaron and like the dew upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's dwelling place, the temple, was located in Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, the church is a person; on the other hand, it is a place.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Upon the person there is the ointment, and upon the place there is the dew.</S>
