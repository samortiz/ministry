It is difficult for a pretentious person to grow in the Lord. He needs to experience a double breaking from the Lord. An ordinary man has the flesh within him. A pretentious man not only is corrupted in the flesh but also has a false fa&#231;ade. An ordinary man only needs to deal with his flesh. A pretentious man needs to deal not only with his flesh but with his pretentious shell as well, including his false goodness, false godliness, false humility, false meekness, or scholarly fa&#231;ade. It takes twice as much effort to deliver such a one out of his condition. God must first break down his pretension, performance, unnaturalness, and untruthfulness before He can break down his flesh. When we contact a brother, we have to know whether he is acting naturally or pretentiously. We have to know whether he has a fa&#231;ade around him or whether he has been dealt with by God. We have to identify any hypocrisy in him. He may smile in front of us, but this smile may not be genuine; it may only be an outward fa&#231;ade. Some are very attractive in the way they speak and act, but as soon as an experienced brother spends a little time with them, their fallen state is exposed. If we desire to walk properly as a child of God, we have to learn to identify pretension. Some of us are deceived in this matter because we are pretentious and dishonest ourselves. If we want to deal with others in this area, we must first learn to judge all of our own falsehood. Everything consisting of just outward performance, being void of an inward reality of the heart, must be removed completely. Once we have dealt with all of our own pretensions, our spirit will become very sensitive and pure, and we will detect falsehood in others immediately. Once falsehood is detected, our spirit will react; it will feel uneasy or even angry because it has been defiled.</p><h2 class="head2">The Condition of the Spirit</h2><p>When our spirit reaches out to touch others, we have to be as sensitive as possible. We have to touch the condition of others' spirit. Some are a little shy and afraid to expose themselves. If our spirit is clean, we will feel this shyness. When we talk with such ones, we can encourage them a little. Some spirits are wounded&mdash;perhaps these ones have had family problems or have received unjust treatment or harsh words from others. Once we identify their condition, we have to know how we can best help them. We may have to apply wine or oil to their wound. We have to be certain of our help. With some, we have to inflict some additional hurt to their wound because this is the only way they will receive any benefit. Others may die as soon as we add anything to their wound. Some wounds are only skin deep, and we should hit such ones harder. In dealing with men, we have to be certain of what we are doing. Some people need oil; others need wine. Still others need to be stripped of these things instead. Some should be comforted with the Lord's word. Others should be rebuked with severe admonishment. Some spirits are apparently asleep and must be awakened. We must first know the true condition of a person. Then we should deal with him either harshly or lightly. Some spirits are dozing; others are pressed or squelched. Some people are very indifferent to spiritual things. The condition of men varies. In order to deal with men, we have to know the condition of their spirit and the cause of their condition. These things must be clear to us; we must not be ignorant of them. As workers, we should always be objective. We should always know men's spirit. Some try to render help to others with their natural mind and mental knowledge. This help has no spiritual value whatsoever. It is useless to learn a speech and pass it on to others. We must first go through the dealings ourselves before we can render help to others.</p><h2 class="head2">An Unidentifiable Spirit</h2><p>The above six conditions are more common in the course of our dealing with people. In addition to these six, there is another phenomenon: Some spirits are unidentifiable; they are murky. We cannot identify the source of the problem. When we listen to their words or testimony, we know that they are sick, but we do not know what they are sick of. This phenomenon sometimes presents itself to the brothers who are quite knowledgeable in the matter of spiritual judgment. Some people simply do not fit into any category; we cannot pinpoint the source of their problem. We think that they are sick, they appear to be sick, and yet they act as if they are not sick. In most cases this condition points to the presence of unnamed or hidden sin. It may even point to something more serious than sin, like works of the devil or attacks from Satan. Sometimes a person sins accidentally, and the devil seizes the opportunity and works within him. Experienced ones should be able to detect such special conditions. We have to learn to exercise our spirit to sense this subtle malady. If we are able to identify these seven conditions in the brothers and sisters during our contact with them, we can pinpoint most of their problems. This word applies only to those who are experienced in this work.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
