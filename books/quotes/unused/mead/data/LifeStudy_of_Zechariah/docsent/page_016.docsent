   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Perfection of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Extended to Joshua</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Zechariah 3:3-10 shows us how the perfection of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was extended to Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>a. Removing the Filthy Garments from Him</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the Angel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And He answered and spoke to those standing before Him, saying, Remove the filthy garments from him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then He said to him, See, I hereby make your iniquity pass from you" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>3-4a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Recently, as I was considering how the high priest could still be clothed with filthy garments, I was reminded how even the believers in the church could steal Eph 4:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may not steal outwardly, but we may inwardly desire something that belongs to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is covetousness and greediness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, every day we speak a lot, and the matters we cover in our talk or gossip may be either dirty or with an evil intention to defame others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why we must often pray, "Lord, cleanse me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I realize that I am still filthy because I still live in the flesh, which is altogether filthy."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Angel of Jehovah knew all the things concerning Joshua and did not give Satan any time to accuse.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In such a situation Joshua may not have been at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan was beside him, the dirty garments were upon him, and the Angel of Jehovah was before him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the perfection of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah was extended to Joshua by removing the filthy garments from him, thus making his iniquity pass from him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Clothing Him with Stately Robes</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only did Joshua's iniquity pass from him, but he was also clothed with "stately robes" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>4b, 5b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A stately robe is a garment that is fitting to one's office and status.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, judges are clothed with stately robes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Likewise, Joshua was clothed with garments befitting his office and status as high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Crowning Him with a Clean Turban upon His Head</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"And I said, Let them put a clean turban upon his head.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And they put the clean turban upon his head and clothed him with garments while the Angel of Jehovah stood by" v. 5 . This clean turban signifies that Joshua had been fully cleansed and was now clean in the presence of Christ as the Angel of Jehovah.</S>
