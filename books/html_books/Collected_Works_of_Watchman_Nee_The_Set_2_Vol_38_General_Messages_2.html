In it we see two persons&mdash;a man of God and an old prophet. Both men were used by God, but both had a tragic ending. The lesson we draw from these two men is a very grave one.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>The old prophet was a prophet who was once used by God; however, God could not use him any longer. Jeroboam sinned in Bethel, and God intended to warn him. But He did not ask the old prophet in Bethel to speak for Him; instead, He sent the man of God from Judah to speak for Him. This means that the old prophet could no longer be used by God. The "oldness" of the old prophet does not imply spiritual maturity or the abundance of spiritual experience but staleness. He was no longer useful in the hand of God. When God wanted to speak with Jeroboam, He could only go to the man of God; He could no longer use the old prophet. Man of God implies a person in fellowship with God. Fellowship is the basis of light. Whenever fellowship ceases, light stops. The old prophet had a spiritual history; he was once a prophet. But he lost his fellowship with God and became an old prophet. God could no longer use him. What a sobering thing this is!</p><p>The spiritual condition of many brothers and sisters today is the same as their condition eight or ten years ago. They have not made any spiritual progress before the Lord. Some have a good mind and appear to have made some progress. Actually the progress is not spiritual progress at all. They speak what they do not understand. Even as they are speaking, they do not understand what they are saying. They only have mental knowledge but not genuine light. They have picked up many spiritual terms, but in God's eyes they have not made any genuine spiritual progress at all. Some people received some light ten years ago, and their condition was quite proper before the Lord at that time. But when you meet them ten years later, they do not have any fresh light, and there is no spiritual growth at all. They are prophets, but old prophets through whom God can no longer speak. God is a God who is always working. The Lord said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working" (John 5:17). The light we received twenty years ago, ten years ago, or even five years ago is not sufficient to be our guide today. If we remain in our past experiences, we will have no way to go on.</p><p>We must pay attention to this one question: How can we not be put aside by the Lord? How can we preserve ourselves from being rejected by the Lord? The question of freshness is a big one before the Lord. The question of spiritual riches is also a big one before the Lord. Many times we are too old and too poor spiritually!</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>The old prophet lived in Bethel. What was the condition of Bethel at that time? In Bethel Jeroboam sacrificed to the calves he made, appointed priests of the lowest people, who were not of the sons of Levi, made offerings upon the altar, and burned incense on the days and months that he had devised of his own heart (1 Kings 12:28-33). All these things offended the Lord. Jeroboam was afraid that the people would offer sacrifices in Jerusalem. Therefore, he set up another place of worship outside Jerusalem. He was not worshipping other gods; he was still worshipping the God who led the Israelites out of Egypt. But he worshipped according to his own way outside Jerusalem, and for that the Lord condemned him. He did not sin alone but led many kings into the same sin (see 1 Kings 16:19, 31; 22:52; 2 Kings 13:2, etc.). The sin that Jeroboam committed in Bethel was a very serious sin. The old prophet was living in Bethel, and the acts of Jeroboam were committed before his very eyes, yet he did not consider them as sins. This is too serious! A prophet speaks for God because he understands God's heart's desire. But here was an old prophet who did not understand God's heart's desire. Those who do not know God's heart's desire can never speak for God. God cannot commission anyone to speak for Him who does not know His heart. Therefore, He had to send the man of God.</p><p>The old prophet did not see any sin in the worship at Bethel. This proves that something was wrong with him. Brothers and sisters, do not think that practicing love is being a nice person. There is no such thing. If you think that this and that are good, that it is good to worship God in Jerusalem and equally good to worship in Bethel, you have not seen anything and you are sick. Many people are like the old prophet; their eyes are blinded, and they are sick. They do not see the things that offend God, and they think that it is good to worship God any way they like. They do not understand why it is wrong to worship in Bethel. Brothers and sisters, can you say that this is love? A doctor can care for his patient and love his patient, but he cannot cheat his patient and tell him that he is not sick. If a doctor says that a sick man is not sick, it proves that there is something wrong with the doctor himself; his eyes are blind. The old prophet lived in Bethel, yet he did not see the sin of Bethel. Sin was before him, yet he did not have any feeling for it. What a tragedy this is! How terrible this is!</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>But what was tragic was not just the condition of the old prophet but the damage the man of God suffered under the old prophet! The Lord charged the man of God saying, "Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest" (1 Kings 13:9). The man of God remembered this charge and rejected the offer of the king. He also rejected the first invitation of the old prophet. Yet he was deceived when the old prophet said, "I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water" (v. 18). He thought that the old prophet was more experienced than he, and he thought that he should listen to him. He returned with the old prophet and ate bread and drank water in his house. The man of God disobeyed the Lord's charge because of the word of the old prophet, and he was killed by a lion. He was very clear about the Lord's charge but was affected by the words, "I am a prophet also," and he became confused. Here we must learn a grave lesson. Once a servant of the Lord has received a clear commandment from the Lord, he should never listen to an old prophet whose word does not match the Lord's charge.</p><p>Paul's charge to the Galatian believers was along the same principle. "If even we or an angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be accursed" (Gal. 1:8). The gospel which Paul preached was not according to man but according to the revelation of Jesus Christ (vv. 11-12). But there was another group of people who tried to change the gospel of Christ. They preached another gospel to the Galatian believers. Paul warned the Galatian believers not to be deceived by them. He saw through the deception of the ones who came as servants of God and who tried to distract others with seemingly spiritual words. He warned the Galatians with severe words. He said, "But if even we..." This means that even if Paul himself went to them and preached a gospel different from what he had been preaching, they should not believe in it; they should only believe in the gospel which came from the revelation of Jesus Christ. They should not put their trust in the name "Paul." If he, Paul, were to preach a gospel different from the one he had received from God, they should not believe in it. Paul knew that many people were easily influenced by names; it was easier for them to believe in man's name than in God's word. Therefore, he took a stand; he spoke on behalf of God's truth. He did not give any ground to man or to himself. He wanted them to follow God's truth completely and not man's name. Paul struggled to defend the truth; he was absolutely for God and not for himself at all. He maintained God's truth, not his own name. The only reason he opposed the deceivers was because they had adulterated the word of God and had led the believers into error. He showed us that we should stand on God's side and choose what words we should receive and what words we should reject. If anyone teaches anything that is contrary to God's truth, we cannot listen to him no matter who he is. Paul said, "But if...an angel out of heaven..." He reminded them that they could not even lightly accept the words of the angels. In 2 Corinthians 11:13-15, when Paul spoke about the false apostles, he said, "For such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if also his ministers transfigure themselves into ministers of righteousness." An "angel of light" comes with a mask of benevolence, and it is easy for a man to drop his guard. The Galatians were deceived after they had heard the gospel of the Lord because these ones claimed that they were also preaching the gospel, and that they were zealous for the law of God. Their words seemed persuasive, and the Galatians who had heard the truth were deceived. These deceivers often creep into the church to damage men's faith and to entice them from the Lord's way. We must guard against them watchfully. They are able to deceive others through their false spirituality and their pretended love for the Lord. They speak about "God's revelations" and "God's will," and they can teach seemingly correct doctrines. They confuse truth with falsehood and easily deceive others. Brothers and sisters, we should have a watchful heart and discerning power; we should be faithful to God's Word and keep the faith that has been once delivered to us. We should reject all the "gospels" of those who adulterate the Lord's word, no matter who they are, and we must ask the Lord to keep us in His truth.</p><p>This old prophet did not have any feeling concerning the great sin that Jeroboam had committed. Yet he cheated others with his title of "prophet." He had lost his fellowship with God, yet he still claimed that "an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord." The failure of the man of God lies in the fact that he did not keep the word which he had received directly from God; he was shaken by the vain name of the old prophet and deceived by his lies; therefore, he fell into tragedy.</p><p>The old prophet was so fallen that he even lied to a man sent from God. When they were sitting together at the feast, the word of the Lord came to the old prophet. Does this mean that he had become spiritual again? No. God was dealing with the man of God who had disobeyed His word. He no longer had any demand on the old prophet; God already had put him aside. After the man of God was killed by the lion, the old prophet buried him in his own grave and charged his sons to bury him next to the man of God when he died. The old prophet believed that the word which the Lord charged the man of God to speak against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places which were in the cities of Samaria would surely come to pass. Yet he himself simply waited to die there!</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should remember a few things from this sober and tragic story. First, once a man has lost his fellowship with God, he becomes old, blind, and stale. Second, even though a man has been used by the Lord, once he departs from God, he must no longer deceive others with his "qualifications." Third, once a man disobeys God's word and stays in a place that he should not stay, spiritual death will result. Fourth, any spiritual utterance must match the word of God. Otherwise, even if the words come from an old prophet or from an angel, one should reject them resolutely.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE WORK OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:28-29; Eph. 2:10; Gal. 1:11-12, 16; 1 Cor. 3:9-15</h1><h2 class="head1">MAN CANNOT WORK THE WORKS OF GOD</h2><p>In John 6:28 a group of people asked the Lord Jesus what they should do that they might work the works of God. They were zealous for God and wanted to do God's work. But they did not know what it was to work the works of God. They thought that once they knew what to do, they could do it. Once the question of "what to do" was settled, they thought that they could engage themselves in God's work. The question of whether or not they could actually do the work was not part of their consideration at all; they only needed to know what to do. Here we see man's desire to participate in God's work. He feels that he can work God's work; he thinks that his ability is great enough to take up God's work.</p><p>But the Lord's answer was entirely different from man's question. The Lord said, "This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He has sent" (v. 29). While man boasted of what he could do, the Lord replied that man ought to believe. Man's trying to do something means that he wants to prove his ability; man's believing means that he acknowledges his inability to do anything. Believing is receiving (John 1:12), and believing into the One whom God sent means believing into the Lord Jesus. There is no question of human merit or human ability. Man cannot do anything; God has done it all. All that man needs to do is receive, stretch out his hand, and take in the Son of God. Faith signifies that God has done all the work; He has given us His only begotten Son. There is no need for man to do anything; all he has to do is accept what God has done.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING WORKED</h2><p>Following this the Lord said, "This is the work of God." The ignorant ones thought that they could work the works of God. They were zealous and trying to do something for God. But the Lord told them that the work of God is to believe into Him whom God has sent. This is the work of God. It is not what man has done for God but what God has done Himself. It is the work of God and not the work of man. For man to believe in the Lord Jesus is a work of God; it is not something that man does but something that God does. God's work can only be done by God alone. Man cannot work God's work; he has no part in God's work.</p><p>Consider the story of Martha and Mary. It serves as a good illustration of our point. Martha was busily serving the Lord. She did a great deal of work and was so busy that she asked the Lord to send her sister over to help her. Perhaps she thought that by expending so much effort, paying such a price, and suffering so much hardship she would be considered as having served the Lord and having done some work for Him. Yet the Lord did not praise her. Instead He said, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; but there is need of one thing, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her" (Luke 10:41-42).</p><p>What had Mary done? The Bible says that Mary sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to His word. Sitting and listening do not constitute a work at all. She was not as busy as her sister; she was quietly sitting at the Lord's feet and drawing near to Him. Listening to His word is receiving His word. The Lord's word is spirit and life, and He dispenses life to men through His word. Mary was receiving the Lord's word and affording Him the opportunity to operate on her. She was giving the Lord the opportunity to dispense Himself into her through the word. Mary was just a receiving vessel. The One doing the work was the Lord, not Mary. She, the person, was the work of the Lord; she was the object of the Lord's work. Ephesians 2:10 says, "We are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works." Thank the Lord that we are not the work of man but the work of God. God's work is fully trustworthy. Oh, what a glorious fact that we are the work of God!</p><h2 class="head1">MAN WORKING TOGETHER WITH GOD</h2><p>Does this mean that man has no place in the work of God? Why did Paul say, "For we are God's fellow workers" (1 Cor. 3:9)? He asked the Corinthian believers, "Are you not my work in the Lord?" (9:1). We must consider the way Paul became a fellow worker of God. First Corinthians 3 shows us that God is the Lord of the work and that all the workers are under His direction.</p><p>Paul told us in Galatians that the word he preached was according to revelation because it pleased God to reveal His Son in him. Through revelation, Paul received genuine spiritual knowledge of Christ. As a result, he did not confer with flesh and blood; instead, he preached the Christ whom he knew through revelation to the Gentiles. Paul was able to work because he first allowed God to work in him; he allowed God to work Himself into him. First God revealed His Son through the Spirit in Paul; he came to know Christ according to spiritual reality and not according to flesh (2 Cor. 5:16). Then Paul was able to preach this Christ he had received to others. Paul did not preach an objective Christ; he did not preach an intangible Christ. He preached a Christ whom he had experienced personally. Christ was as real in him as his very self. Christ was in him, and he was in Christ. Christ was in his thoughts, his words, and his actions. Christ was the Lord within Paul, and Paul was Christ's outward expression. You may say that he was Paul. You may also say that Christ was seen in him and that he was Christ, for indeed he was taken possession of by Christ (Phil. 3:12, Darby's New Translation). Paul's preaching was based on what he had. The measure of Christ that he knew became the measure of Christ he preached to others.</p><p>Therefore, being a fellow worker of God does not mean that we should work for God. Rather, it means that we should first allow God to work Christ into us. Only then can we tell others about the Christ we know through revelation. The work is still the Lord's; man is only there to report His work. Paul asked the Corinthian saints, "Are you not my work in the Lord?" (1 Cor. 9:1). Their being in the Lord was the result of Paul's preaching the Christ he knew to them and of their receiving.</p><p>What was the message Paul preached among the Corinthians? He said, "For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified" (1 Cor. 2:2). This was the central message which he preached. Here we see the two aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit in the believers. On the negative side, there is the removing of the old creation from the believers through the cross. On the positive side, there is the constitution of Christ into the believers through revelation for the building up of the new creation. What Paul preached is the same as what the Holy Spirit is revealing in the believers today. Just as the Holy Spirit revealed the knowledge of Christ and His crucifixion to Paul, so also the Holy Spirit is revealing the knowledge of Christ and His crucifixion to us today. We repeat that the work is the Lord's; man is here only to speak of His work within man.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORK</h2><p>This is why Paul said that the foundation of the work is Jesus Christ and that no one else can lay another foundation. He also said that we are God's cultivated land and His building. If the seed sown in the cultivated land is Christ, the harvest must also be Christ. If the foundation of the building is Christ, the building itself must also be according to Christ. At the time of our regeneration, God put the life of Christ into us, and we received a life which we did not have before. The life which we received at the time of regeneration is an additional life. It is something added to us at the time of regeneration. This is the work of God. God's work in man is absolutely based on this added life. This life is Christ (Col. 3:4), and it is the foundation of the work of God. Just as the regenerated life is absolutely of God, the growth and maturity of this life can only be brought about by God (2 Cor. 5:5). Man's hand has no part in this, and even the best of what man has cannot participate in this. The greatest responsibility that man has is to cooperate with God and not afford any hindrance to His work. Sanctification is merely the continuation of this life, and victory is merely the outflow of this life in overcoming sin, the flesh, the world, and Satan. The growth and maturity of this life are simply the reigning and ruling of this life over the whole being. The life we received at the time of regeneration is the beginning of the work of God. Therefore, the continuation of this work cannot be affected by anything other than this life. Brothers and sisters, especially those who are called to the Lord's work, we have to be very careful. If we really want to be fellow workers of God, our work must be this pure. We need to deny the best that we have in fear and trembling so that God's work will not suffer any mixture. We must remember that without the revelation of the Holy Spirit, without seeing and experiencing something in the reality of the spirit, we cannot do God's work.</p><p>Only a regenerated person can testify of the Lord's salvation. Those who do not have the experience of regeneration cannot do this work. Victory, sanctification, the filling of the Spirit, and the reigning of the indwelling Christ can only be testified by those who by grace have passed through these experiences in a genuine way. Even while they are testifying, they must still trust in the working of the Holy Spirit. Without the working of the Spirit, there will not be any anointing from the Lord. Dependence is an absolute necessity in spiritual work. Unless the Spirit of the Lord works, no work of man will accomplish anything.</p><p>Please remember that God's work is first God working in us and then God working out of us through the Spirit. Only such a work will build the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MATERIAL FOR THE WORK</h2><p>First Corinthians 3:12 tells us that the working material of some people is gold, silver, and precious stones, while the working material of other people is wood, grass, and stubble. The day will come and reveal everything by fire; the fire will prove of what sort is each one's work. We know that wood, grass, and stubble do not remain once they are burned. But gold, silver, and precious stones are things that cannot be burned away. Gold signifies something of God; it is the work of God. Silver signifies redemption; it is the work of the Lord on the cross. The precious stones signify the work of the Holy Spirit, which is the Holy Spirit's constitution of the life of God in man through revelation, blending God and man into one. This is our subjective experience today. The precious stones are compounds. In order to be compounded together, there is the need of intense heat. After this, there is still need of a carving work by the hand of the craftsmen before we can have some shining precious stones. This is how God constitutes Himself in the believers. On the one hand, God uses the environment to burn the believers. On the other hand, they must pass through God's carving hand, which removes what He does not approve of and retains what He does approve of through the revelation of the Spirit. Only then will they shine and glorify God.</p><p>Those who have become precious stones, who are both human and divine, are the masterpieces of God in Christ. These are the ones in whom God can trust. First Corinthians 7:25-40 is clearly Paul's own words because he said clearly that he did not have the Lord's command. Yet at the end he said that he had the Spirit of God. For a period of time, Madam Guyon found that as soon as she set her mind on something within herself, it was accomplished around her. This is because her mind had become the mind of God. Although the words of these ones issue from themselves, God honors their words. He is not afraid of joining Himself to them. They have lost themselves in God as a drop of water has lost itself in the ocean; the water and the ocean have become inseparable. These are precious stones; they are the consummation of the work of the Holy Spirit and the glory of God.</p><p>We should humble ourselves before the Lord and allow Him to work on us, to constitute the life of Christ into us. Only then will we be able to help others, and only then will they know the constitution of the Holy Spirit. This is the work of precious stones.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>Now let us consider the work of the Holy Spirit in man.</p><h2 class="head2">1. The Beginning of the Work&mdash;Pentecost</h2><p>At Pentecost, the Holy Spirit&mdash;the Worker&mdash;descended and began His work on earth, convicting men of sin and turning them to believe in Jesus. He continues His work by living within the believers, enabling them to grow in spiritual stature and to mature in life.</p><h2 class="head2">2. The Place of the Work&mdash;the Spirit of Man</h2><p>The Holy Spirit abides in man's spirit. This spirit is the place from which He works; it is the center of His operation. All spiritual work begins in man's spirit.</p><p>The work of the Holy Spirit is twofold: the direct work and the indirect work. The direct work of the Holy Spirit is to reveal God's desire in man's spirit, then to enlighten man's soul so that his mind will understand, and finally to direct the body to execute God's will. The indirect work of the Holy Spirit is God's speaking to man through all kinds of circumstances. At times He uses the Bible, and at other times He uses angels, persons, things, or events. For example, He spoke to Brother Lawrence through the barren trees in winter and convinced him of God's resurrection power. Our wise God speaks to man in many ways. Yet one thing is certain: The word spoken must be transmitted into man's spirit before it will have any genuine effect on his spiritual life.</p><h2 class="head2">3. The Direction of the Work&mdash;<br />from the Center to the Circumference</h2><p>God's work always begins from the center and goes to the circumference. God reveals Himself within man's center, his spirit, then extends to his soul, enlightening his mind, and finally directs his body to execute His will. Take the matter of sanctification as an example. The God we know in our spirit is absolutely holy. This holy God is joined to our spirit through the Holy Spirit (we become one spirit with the Lord). From this spirit God enlightens our mind, so that our mind begins to understand. The power of holiness thus begins to operate in our mind. All unholy thoughts are rejected, and anything that is incompatible with God is immediately denied. In this way, the soul becomes sanctified. At the same time, the effect reaches the body, particularly the eyes. The inward sanctifying power will direct the eyes, so that they can no longer look at anything that is contrary to holiness. The eyes will shun everything unholy. When the Holy Spirit speaks through the ones who know holiness in such a genuine way, their words will convey the sanctification that they have seen and experienced, and they will produce an effect in others.</p><h2 class="head2">4. The Method of the Work&mdash;Revelation</h2><p>Revelation is the method by which God works. Revelation is something of the spirit. Hence, the spirit and not the mind comes first. The spirit and life take priority, while the mind and the intellect follow. Many people use their mind and intellect to seek after God's will. The result is confusion in the mind. They will never know God's will this way because the method is wrong. The first thing God wants us to do is to wait for His revelation in our spirit. After this, He will enlighten our mind. Only then will we know God's will. We must remember that the mind is secondary and not primary in spiritual matters. This does not mean that we should not use the mind, but we should use it as a secondary means.</p><p>We need to consider a few things that constitute a spiritual vision. God's Word shows us that at least three things are needed. The first is revelation. The meaning of revelation is an unveiling or a removing of the covering. Suppose that there is a book in a cabinet, yet it cannot be seen because the door of the cabinet is closed. The door must be opened before the book can be revealed. The second thing is light. If this room does not have any light, one cannot see anything even when something is placed before his eyes. The third is opened eyes. A thing may be uncovered and light may be present, but one cannot see anything if his eyes are closed. The Holy Spirit unveils the reality of Christ to man through revelation. At the same time, He enlightens the mind in man's soul. The mind is man's inner eyes. As long as a man does not have the eyes of the Laodiceans, he will see. The Laodiceans did not see because they felt that they had something; they thought that they had something. Once there is a thought of having something, that thought becomes a veil to the eyes, and a person becomes blind. Blessed are those who are poor in spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">5. The Lines of the Work</h2><p>There are two lines in God's work. On the negative line, God's work leads man to a knowledge of himself through revelation. Once man sees himself, he will apply the cross to deal with sin, the flesh, and the world by the power of the Spirit. On the positive line, the Holy Spirit reveals Christ to man's spirit and dispenses Christ to man. Man receives Christ by faith and abides in Him, allowing His life to be wrought into his being. The measure of revelation and knowledge of Christ determines the measure of the stature of one's spiritual life. The destination of these two lines of work is the purifying of the "self" to the point that nothing of the "self" remains and only Christ occupies the whole being.</p><h2 class="head2">6. The Pattern and Goal of the Work</h2><p>When Moses built the tabernacle, God showed him the pattern on the mount. He could not change anything; everything had to be built according to the pattern of God's instruction. Today the building work of the Holy Spirit in us is according to the pattern of Christ. Nothing apart from Christ can be brought in. The work of the Holy Spirit is absolutely pure, and His work is to make men as pure as the Lord (1 John 3:3).</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROPER ATTITUDE<br />OF THOSE WHO ARE BEING WORKED ON</h2><p>Mary had a proper attitude. There are at least four aspects to a proper attitude.</p><p>(1) She was at the feet of the Lord Jesus, and not at the feet of anyone else. She was drawing near to the Lord. This is the shortest and quickest way to grow in life. No method is better than coming to Him moment by moment, loving Him, worshipping Him, and unceasingly fellowshipping with Him and remaining in His presence. Many who know God in a deep way have found this way. Madam Guyon said, "Our drawing near to God constitutes all service." Paul also charged us to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). If a man unceasingly fellowships with the indwelling Christ with an unveiled face, he will be changed into the Lord's likeness (2 Cor. 3:18).</p><p>(2) She sat at the feet of the Lord. This means that she put herself in a humble position. Humility is a crucial condition for receiving God's blessing. God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble (1 Pet. 5:5). Humility is not belittling ourselves; humility is ignoring ourselves, negating ourselves, and considering ourselves as nothing. If we draw near to God with deep humility, He will give grace to us.</p><p>(3) She was sitting down. She was not busy like her sister. Quietness is often the source of spiritual strength. The greatest challenge man faces is being quiet before the Lord. His eyes and thoughts often are distracted to the outside world. Of all the members in the body, the eyes are the busiest, and of all the faculties in the soul, the mind is the busiest. Those who are busy cannot receive revelation easily. A wandering mind and vacillating thoughts are like restless waves on a lake; the lake will never be able to clearly reflect the flowers and trees on the shore. If a man wants to have the Lord's image imprinted in him and to be transformed into the Lord's image, quietness is a necessity.</p><p>(4) She was listening to the Lord's word. The words that the Lord speaks are spirit and life. Through this word, the Lord dispenses Himself to men. Her listening to the Lord's word afforded the Lord the opportunity to communicate Himself to her so that she would gain the Lord and become like Him. She was continually receiving the Lord Himself. She did not just hear words; she was meeting the Lord. Brothers and sisters, it is a pity for anyone to just hear man's voice in a sermon and not meet the Christ behind the voice.</p><h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO CONVEY GOD'S WORD</h2><p>In conveying God's word to others, a servant of God has to take care of the following points:</p><p>(1) He should speak in the Spirit. On the one hand, he should be in fear and trembling concerning himself. On the other hand, he should be strictly controlled, restricted, and directed by the indwelling Spirit. Anything spiritual must be spoken in the Spirit; otherwise, it will make the listener feel extremely uncomfortable. Your inner sense (the spiritual consciousness) will tell you if the source is wrong, even though the words may be right. There may be nothing wrong with the wording, but the condition of the speaker may be wrong. When this happens, God will not seal His presence on the words. A more descriptive way of putting it is to call this a jewel of gold in a swine's snout (Prov. 11:22); the two things do not match one another.</p><p>(2) He should not speak under an atmosphere dominated by the flesh. When others are jesting and there is an absence of any spiritual atmosphere whatsoever, one cannot speak. This is like putting an egg in a refrigerator; it is impossible to hatch an egg this way.</p><p>(3) He should dispense spiritual reality to others. God's revelation always conveys spiritual things, which are as real as physical things. A cup is an object, and a chair is an object; they are real things. Spiritual things are just as real as physical objects. They are not theories or philosophies. In conveying the word, one should present real things to others.</p><p>(4) He should ask the Lord for suitable spiritual utterance to convey spiritual things. For example, in explaining self-analysis, Brother Lawrence said, "Self-analysis is the dying flicker left behind from self-love; it is the activity of self-love under the zealous mask of one's pursuit for perfection." Self-analysis is an undesirable element in our spiritual experience; it is a kind of introspection. Brother Lawrence explained this spiritual thing with a spiritual utterance. This is what it means to interpret spiritual things with spiritual words (1 Cor. 2:13).</p><p>(5) Spiritual things can only be understood by a spiritual man; a carnal man cannot understand them (1 Cor. 2:14). Since there is nothing spiritual within the carnal man, he cannot understand them. The spiritual man has the real thing within him; therefore, he can understand. Suppose you met a man who had never seen a watch before. It would not matter how much you explained what a watch is like; he would not understand. But if you showed him a watch and then told him what it was and what it was used for, he would understand. Hence, one must first see a thing before he can understand anything that is spoken concerning it. The same is true with spiritual things. For example, the matter of regeneration is the first spiritual experience of a Christian. Many people have listened to sermons for years without being regenerated. If you tell them about the experience of regeneration, it is like telling a naturally blind person about the light of the sun; he will not understand it. This is because he does not have that very thing within him. It is no wonder that he cannot understand. Some people are indeed regenerated. They have had the experience of regeneration, yet the gospel they received was not very complete. They do not know that they are regenerated and saved; they are still hoping to be saved. One needs to tell such people the truth of regeneration. Since they have the fact of regeneration, they will understand it once they hear. Hence, those who convey God's word to others must first show them the real thing and then use suitable words to convey it to them so that the listener will receive not only the spiritual fact but also the spiritual knowledge. The principle that applies to regeneration applies to every subsequent experience. The more revelation a believer receives, the more his life grows. If someone with spiritual utterance points out the revelation, that is, if he points out the very thing he has received, others will not only see, but also understand. If a man preaches the word this way, the church will receive real edification.</p><h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO LISTEN TO THE WORD</h2><p>Those who listen to the word should also take care of a few things.</p><p>(1) Do not expect to hear good teaching. Instead, expect to meet Christ. Listening to a message is not for the purpose of satisfying the intellect but for the purpose of receiving the supply of life. Some people can give very thoughtful, clever, and persuasive messages. Yet they produce no spiritual result. We should not admire this kind of message. The kind of messages that we need are those that enable us to touch something spiritual in an inward way; they must be messages that allow us to touch the Christ behind the words. These words carry life and power, and they bring about a spiritual change as well as an increase of spiritual stature in a person. We have to ask the Lord to give us the grace to have the power of discernment so that we will pursue after the right things.</p><p>(2) When we hear something we do not understand, we should wait humbly for the Lord's timing because spiritual understanding has quite much to do with spiritual age. We may not understand it now, but we may understand it a few years later. We should never criticize lightly the things we do not understand, lest we suffer a loss. On the other hand, never think that any spiritual thing is so easy and that we understand it all. We have to realize that it may have taken others a few years to learn certain lessons before they could deliver the messages they are giving.</p><p>(3) Beware of substitutes. When a person is talking about a deer, we may understand it to be a horse. Actually the two things are absolutely different. For example, when we talk about "reality," we are referring to the things that the Holy Spirit reveals to us in Christ. But many people (even those who have been workers for years) have taken practicality to mean reality. If practicality is reality, the men in 1 Corinthians 13:3 have the most reality. But actually, they had no reality at all. (Of course, those who have reality have practicality also.) For example, when some say that they have received light, they mean they have received a new idea in their mind, a concept which they think is reasonable. The source is the intellect, and it is powerless. Other people think that light comes when the eyes see certain physical rays. But none of this is light. The genuine light of life comes from the revelation of the Spirit and is understood in the mind afterwards. It is something real that we see; it is a spiritual reality which the Spirit unveils to us, and it comes with power. Some brothers have stated that with light there is killing, shining, and burning, and it results in a change in life. For example, when a man is saved, the Spirit enlightens him and shows him his sins. He realizes the evil of his sins. He feels ashamed and hates his sins. The sins that we confess under the light can be far more numerous than the sins we know in our mind. This is the light of life. Unfortunately, some have substitutes and have not seen anything genuine. Therefore, we have to humble ourselves and not think that we understand and know everything.</p><p>(4) We should humble ourselves before God and pray for the speaker. We should pray that God will release the word of life. We should also pray for the audience and ourselves so that the words we hear will penetrate the depth of our being and become revelation and light to us and that the church will grow in the stature of Christ. This is the cooperation a listener can render to the speaker.</p><p>Finally, may the Lord be merciful to us, so that we realize that God alone is the One who can accomplish His work; we are merely speaking what we see through revelation. May we learn to cooperate with God, to remove all hindrances, to change nothing of the pattern on the mount, and to be purified by the light until we are free from all mixture. We need to always look to Him, always trust in Him, and acknowledge with fear and trembling that "we are unprofitable slaves" (Luke 17:10).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY</h1><h1 class="title">LEARNING THE LESSONS IN OUR SERVICE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:6; 12:1; Exo. 40:17-33</h1><p>In learning to serve the Lord in the church, we should be faithful in practical affairs, but our attention should always focus on the increase of the measure of spirituality. The purpose of taking care of business affairs is to dispense spiritual matters to others. If we only have the business side but are short on the spiritual side, we have deviated from the main focus of our service to the Lord. God has entrusted a spiritual responsibility to us. If we pay attention only to business affairs and neglect life, we have incurred a great loss. If we are short in life, our service will be nothing but a series of activities, and we will be in the realm of outward affairs only. If we are short of life, we will not be able to meet the need of God's children. Life takes care of the need of God's children. We must first have genuine growth in life before we can minister life to other brothers and sisters through the practical affairs.</p><p>If we want to learn to serve the Lord at all, we have to be trained in spiritual matters. In our service to the Lord, we must not be those who only work but never learn. God wants us to learn and grow. We must grow week by week and time after time. God often allows us to fail in order for us to learn some lessons. If we feel that we have succeeded in anything, God will come in to frustrate our success. We must remind ourselves that business affairs should never occupy all of our attention and that we should never neglect spiritual lessons while we are doing our work. We must learn while we work. The more deeply we learn the lessons, the better it will be, and the more thoroughly we are trained, the better it will be. We should not pay attention to our success. Rather, we should pay attention to learning the lessons.</p><p>In the Old Testament, when a priest wanted to serve in the Holy Place, he had to first pass the altar and offer up sacrifices for his own sins. Then he had to pass the laver where he washed away his defilement with water. Further on he entered the Holy Place. Everything in the Holy Place was gilded and shining. Once he touched anything with his hand, a fingerprint appeared on the utensils. As soon as a man goes into the Holy Place and serves, his real condition is exposed. At the same time, no one can act according to his own will in the Holy Place. Every move must be according to God's ordination and cannot deviate from it at all. If we serve Him, we have to see the need of the blood for the cleansing of our sins and the need of the laver for the cleansing of our defilement, or we should not serve God at all. We also have to put  ourselves aside. Only those who have this realization are engaged in genuine service to God. If a man does not have this realization, he is doing something that God does not want him to do, or there is something wrong with him. If we are truly serving the Lord, we will be full of realization whenever we touch the service. It is possible for us to be short of feeling when we eat with others, but we should have a great deal of feeling when we serve together with others. It is possible for us to have little feeling when we transcribe secular notes, but when we are transcribing spiritual material, we cannot help but be touched to pray, "Lord, I am not qualified to engage in Your work. Lord, cleanse me with Your blood." If a man is flippant and indifferent when he touches the Lord's service, he is not a servant of God. Brothers and sisters, if we are doing what God wants us to do, we will immediately feel that there are things that we have not dropped yet. We still have our flesh, and we still are not perfectly submissive to God. There is still disharmony between us and the brothers and sisters. If we visit someone who confesses that he does not come to the meetings because his temper is too rash and if we rebuke him as soon as we hear this, it means that we do not have a feeling about our own quick temper, and our service will not carry any spiritual weight. We must realize that as soon as a priest enters the tabernacle and the Holy Place, he will see his own sin and defilement. He will not fail to see his true condition because he is in a place that is holy. Once a man enters the Holy Place, the self is exposed. Similarly, when we engage ourselves in the service of the Lord, our true condition will be exposed. The place to know the self is in our service to the Lord. The more a person is sensitive toward God's service, the more it proves that he is a true servant of the Lord and that he is doing a service to God. If a man is void of feeling, it proves that he is not a servant of God and that the things he is doing are not a service to the Lord. When a priest who serves the Lord comes to the altar, his sins are exposed. When he comes to the laver, his defilement is exposed, and when he comes into the Holy Place, his whole person is exposed. In the course of our service to the Lord, we see our sins, and we need the cleansing of the blood. We see that we have been defiled, and we need the washing of the water. When we go in further, we see that we cannot touch anything that is holy; the self must be removed. Brothers and sisters, we must never equate spiritual weight with excitement and activity. No, spiritual weight is the manifestation of holiness in our service. With such manifestation, there is the presence of God. Many brothers and sisters can testify that their service in the church is like the service of the priests in the Holy Place; there are things which they need to deal with. They need sins removed by the blood; they need defilement removed by the renewing of the Spirit, and they need their self-element removed through the holiness of the Holy Place. This should be our experience every time we come to serve God. If we do not feel our sinfulness, our defilement, and our self-element, we probably have very little presence of the Lord.</p><p>If a place is a holy convocation of the Lord, the brothers should at least see their own sin, their own defilement, and their self. The presence of this feeling proves the presence of God. This is the Holy Place. When a man comes in, he will be conscious of his sins, his defilement, and his self. This consciousness will force him to go to God and call on Him. This will bring in growth. Every time we see our own condition, our life grows a little more. In serving the Lord, we have to touch that which is "holy" time after time. If we touch it, we will learn something before the Lord, we will grow and be useful, and God will have a way through us. I will repeat. Our service must not be a series of business activities that do not carry any spiritual weight. May the Lord be merciful to us in this matter.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">PRAYER AND GOD'S WORK</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 6:18; Ezek. 36:37; Isa. 62:6-7</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>God works according to certain laws and principles. Although He can act as He pleases, He does not act recklessly; He acts according to His preordained laws and principles. God is above all laws and principles; He is God, and He can act as He pleases. Yet we see a wonderful thing in the Bible. Although He is so great and can act as He pleases, He acts according to laws, and it seems as if He has voluntarily placed Himself under law and is willing to be governed by law.</p><p>What are the principles of God's work? One main principle of God's work is the need for man's prayer. He wants man to cooperate with Him in prayer.</p><p>There was once a Christian who was very experienced in prayer. He said that all spiritual work consists of four steps. In the first step, God intends to do something; there is God's will. In the second step, He reveals this will to His children through the Spirit so that they know His will, His plan, His desire, and His aspiration. In the third step, God's children return His will back to Him through prayer. Prayer is the echoing of God's will. If our heart is in tune with God's heart, spontaneously we will speak forth God's will. As a result God will accomplish His work in the fourth step.</p><p>We will not look at the first and second steps now. We will pay attention to the third step, which is returning God's will back to God. Please pay attention to the word return. All worthwhile prayers are a kind of returning. If our prayer is only for the fulfillment of our plans and wishes, it will not have any value in the spiritual realm. Only the prayers that are initiated by God and that echo what He has initiated have any worth. God's work is governed by prayers. God is willing to do many things, but He will not do them when His people do not pray. He must wait for man to agree with Him before He will do them. This is a great principle of God's work, and it is also one of the most crucial principles in the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>The words in Ezekiel 36:37 are most peculiar. God said that His purpose is to "increase them with men like a flock." This is God's ordination. He will surely accomplish what He has ordained. But He has to wait; He cannot accomplish it immediately. What is God waiting for? He said, "I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them." God ordained that the men of the house of Israel be increased. Yet He had to wait for the Israelites to inquire of Him. Once the Israelites inquired of Him, He would fulfill it. God is determined to do something, but He will do it only after man has given his consent; He will not do it immediately. When God works, He does not work only according to the fact that He has a will; He also waits until there is a response from His children before He acts. This is a most amazing fact.</p><p>We must remember that spiritual work is a matter of God determining and His children agreeing. God initiates, and then His children agree. This is an important principle in spiritual work. God said, "I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel." God's work required the Israelites to inquire. One day, when the Israelites truly inquire of the Lord, God will accomplish it for them. Brothers and sisters, this is the principle of God's work! God may initiate a work, but He will not accomplish it until we pray. From the time the church was formed, God has not done anything without the prayer of His children. From the time that there have been children of God, everything has been done according to the prayer of His children; everything is accomplished by the prayer of His children. We do not know God's reason for doing this. But we know that this is a fact. God is willing to place Himself in this position. He wants to carry out His will through the prayers of His children.</p><p>Another example can be found in Isaiah 62:6-7: "Upon your walls, O Jerusalem,/I have appointed watchmen;/All day and all night/They will never keep silent./You who remind Jehovah,/Do not be dumb;/And do not give Him quiet/Until He establishes/And until He makes Jerusalem /A praise in the earth." God wants Jerusalem to become a praise in the earth. How does He accomplish it? He appointed watchmen upon the walls to remind Him. How should they remind Him? They should not be dumb, and they should not give Him quiet. We must not stop our reminding, and we must not allow God to become quiet. We have to pray until He answers and accomplishes His work. God has a will, and His intention is that Jerusalem would become a city of praise, yet He appointed watchmen on the walls of Jerusalem and charged them to pray. Only after they pray will He work. He asks them not to pray once but unceasingly. They have to pray unceasingly until God's will is accomplished. In other words, God's will is governed by man's prayer. God is waiting for us to pray. The content of God's will is determined by God alone; it is not determined by us, and we have no part in the determination of it. However, the carrying out of His will is governed by our prayer.</p><p>A brother expressed it very well when he said, "God's will is like a train engine, and our prayer is like the tracks of the train." The train can go many places, but it can only travel along the tracks. The power of the engine is very great, and it can go east, west, south, or north. Yet it can only go where the tracks are laid. God is not without power, yet He is controlled by man's prayer. All worthy prayers are prayers that pave the way for God's will. Hence, if we do not take up the responsibility of prayer, we will frustrate the accomplishment of God's will.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>When God created man, He gave man a free will, so that now there are three wills in the universe. One is the will of God, the second is the will of Satan, and the third is the will of man. Man wonders why God would not destroy Satan quickly. But God would not do this. He wants man to join Him in dealing with Satan. God has His will, Satan has his will, and man also has his will. God wants man's will to be joined to Him; He does not want to destroy Satan alone. We do not fully understand, but we know that God wants to do it this way. He does not want to act alone; He wants man to cooperate with Him. This is the responsibility of the church on earth.</p><p>In order to do something, God must first put His will within us through the Holy Spirit. He will only accomplish something after we have echoed it in our prayer. God operates through this procedure. He works this way. He wants man's cooperation; He wants a will that is one with Him and that echoes Him. If God does everything without us, then man does not need to be here, and we do not need to know God's will. Yet every part of God's will needs someone to carry it out, and He wants our will to become one with His will. The first step in carrying out His will is to pray out God's will and utter His will through our prayer. From this we see that prayer is a work. There is no work more important than this work because prayer is the speaking of God's will and the accomplishment of His will. Brothers and sisters, we have to know that God's will is uttered through our prayers. Therefore, prayers that originate from our self-will are useless prayers. Prayers that are according to God's will originate from God. He conveys His will to us through the Holy Spirit, and then we return the same thought to Him through our prayer. Prayers that are after God's heart have God's will as the starting point; man is merely the transmitting and responding organ. Prayer that originates from ourselves has no spiritual value.</p><p>In reading church history, we find that every great revival began with prayer. Prayer enables God to do what He wants to do. We cannot ask God to do what He does not want to do, yet we can delay what He does want to do. God is absolute, and we cannot change Him at all. We cannot ask God to do what He does not want to do, and we cannot ask Him not to do what He wants to do. However, if God needs a channel to carry out His will and we do not cooperate with Him, His work will be hindered on account of us. Hence, when we pray, we are not asking God to do what He does not want to do, and we are not asking Him to change His will. Rather, we are declaring God's will in prayer so that He can do what He intends to do. If we think that by begging desperately we can make God do what He does not want to do, we are wasting our energy; the effort is fruitless. If God does not want to do something, no one can make Him do it. We can only do one thing, and that is to pray for God to do what He wants to do. God will accomplish His work through our oneness with Him.</p><p>The descending of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was prophesied a few hundred years prior to its occurrence, in the time of Joel. Yet many disciples had to pray before the Holy Spirit would descend on them. God had ordained it already, but there had to be men who prayed before it could be fulfilled. Although God can do everything alone, He loves to wait for man to pray before He does anything. God can do many things, but He is waiting for our consent. God is willing to accomplish many things, but He is waiting for our willingness. God is ready to do many things, but without our consent, He still has to wait. Brothers and sisters, although we cannot force God to do what He does not want to do, we can ask Him to do what He wants to do. We have lost many spiritual blessings because we have not expressed God's will through our prayers.</p><p>It would be wonderful if we could engage ourselves exclusively in the work of prayer. God is waiting for man to cooperate with Him so that He can accomplish His work. Some Christians have asked why God does not save more sinners. Why does He not make every believer victorious? We sincerely believe that God would do these things, if there were men who first prayed for them. God is not reluctant to work. He is waiting for a group of people who will cooperate with Him. As soon as man cooperates with God, He will work. There is much spiritual work to be done, but God is waiting for His children to respond. Whether or not the work will succeed depends on how God's children pray. We should respond to God by consenting to work together with Him. He is waiting to bless us. The question is whether or not we will ask.</p><p>Those who do not know God will say, "If God wants to do anything, He can do it all by Himself. Why is there the need for our prayer? God knows everything. If we pray too much, we may tire Him out." We have to remember that man has a free will. God will not act contrary to His will, but neither will He take over man's will. If man does not pray for God's will, He has to wait. If He wants His will to be done on earth as in heaven, He can do it Himself. Why does He need the disciples to pray, "Our Father who is in the heavens...Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth"? (Matt. 6:9-10). If God wants His kingdom to come, He can do it Himself. Why is there the need for His disciples to pray, "Your kingdom come"? If God wants His name to be sanctified by all people, He can do it Himself. Why does He have to ask the disciples to pray, "Your name be sanctified"? The answer to these questions is that God does not want to do anything alone; He wants man's cooperation. God is powerful, but we have to lay the tracks. The more tracks we lay, the more God works. Therefore, our prayers should be like a railway network, the more the better.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>How should we lay the tracks for God's will? Ephesians 6:18 says, "By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance." Our prayer should be by all means and at every time. We should have general prayers, and we should also have specific prayers. Many of our prayers are too loose and too careless; there are too many loopholes. This is why Satan finds many opportunities to creep in. If our prayers are fine and careful, and if we cover everything in prayer, Satan will not be able to do anything.</p><p>Suppose a brother is about to travel to another place to preach the gospel. You should lay the tracks for him so that God's will can be fulfilled in him. If you only pray a few words for him and ask only that God bless him, protect him, and supply him, this prayer-net is too loose. If you want to pray for a person, you need to lay a very careful prayer-net for him so that Satan cannot creep in from any direction. How should you pray? You should start from the time he leaves his home. You should pray for his health, his luggage, and his train. You should pray for the time he will board the train, his food, and his sleep on the train, as well as the people he will meet on the train. You should also pray for everything he will encounter after he leaves the train and for the house where he will eventually be staying. You should pray for the neighbors and the things he will need while he is staying there. You should pray for the time of his work and everything related to him. After you have prayed for him in such a thorough way, Satan will find it very difficult to identify any loopholes from which to attack him. Hence, the work of prayer is a very practical work. Whoever is lazy, foolish, and loose cannot participate in the work of prayer. After we have earnestly prayed over all the aspects of a certain matter, we often find the matter eventually being accomplished.</p><p>There is still one lesson that we have to learn. Satan is full of deception, and we can never anticipate all the schemes that he has. It is impossible for us to pray over them one by one. We can only pray, "Lord, please deal with everything from Satan with Your precious blood." We must realize that the blood is the answer to all the works of Satan. Such a prayer is the best way to deal with Satan. He can never penetrate through these prayers to attack us.</p><p>Every time we pray we have to see three things. First, we must see to whom we are praying. Second, we must see for whom we are praying. Third, we must see against whom we are praying. Many times we remember only two of the three aspects; we remember that we are praying to God and for men, but we put Satan aside. In our prayer, we must not only know to whom we are praying but also against whom we are praying. We must not only know for whom we are praying but also that an enemy is out there to damage us. Our prayer is to God; it is for men, and it is against the devil. If we deal well with these three aspects, God will work for us.</p><p>Everyone who has a genuine desire to work for the Lord must set up a prayer-net so that God can work through him. God is not reluctant to work; He is waiting for men to pray before He will work. He is looking for some who will have a life of prayer. His will is waiting for man's prayer. There is often no predisposed intention to pray, yet something within urges you to pray. This means that some items of God's will are waiting for your prayer. When you have a burden to pray, and you pray accordingly, that prayer is according to God's will; it is the Holy Spirit who is urging you to pray a prayer that is according to God's will. When the Holy Spirit urges you to pray, you should pray. If you do not pray then, you will feel clogged up, and you will feel that something is left undone. If you continue to refuse to pray, you will feel more clogged up. If you insist on not praying to the end, the spirit of prayer and the feeling for prayer will become dull, and you will not be able to easily pick up the same feeling again later. You will have failed to pray according to God's will.</p><p>Every time God wants to put a burden for prayer within us, the Holy Spirit will first give us a feeling and a burden to pray for certain things. Once we have such a feeling, we should immediately pray conscientiously; we should pay a price to pray for that matter. Once we have the prompting of the Spirit, we will immediately have a burden in our spirit, and the burden will remain there. Once we pray, we will feel released, and the rock will be removed. If we do not pray for it conscientiously, we will feel that something is still there. If we do not pray for it, we will feel that we are not being one with God. If we are faithful to prayer and pray immediately after we have a burden, our prayer will not become a burdensome task but an easy and refreshing work. Unfortunately, many people quench the Spirit; they quench the feeling for prayer which the Holy Spirit has put within them. After a while, these feelings no longer come to them, and they are no longer useful vessels in God's hand. They can no longer accomplish anything for the Lord or execute God's will by prayer. Brothers and sisters, if we are this way before the Lord, having lost all feeling for prayer, we are probably in a very dangerous condition. We have lost our fellowship with God, and God can no longer use us for His work. We must be very careful with the feeling that the Holy Spirit gives to us. Anytime we have a burden to pray, we should immediately ask, "God, what do You want me to pray for? What do You want to do now? And what do You want me to pray about?" If we get through in our prayer with this one burden, the Lord will entrust us with a second prayer. If we have not released our first burden, we will not receive a second burden.</p><p>We need to ask the Lord to make us a faithful praying person. Once there is a burden, we should release it immediately; we should express it through prayers. If the burden is too heavy and we cannot release it through prayer alone, then we need to fast. Anything that cannot be released through prayer can only be dealt with by fasting. Fasting can release the burden of prayer quickly; it can help us to unload our heaviest burdens. If we continue to engage ourselves in the work of prayer, we will become a flowing channel for God's will; He will come to us whenever He has something that He wants us to pray about. Brothers and sisters, God's will is always seeking an outlet; God is forever seeking men to be the spokesmen for His will. If many people are raised up to do this work, God will accomplish many things through their prayers.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">WATCH AND BE SOBER</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 22:23-29; 1 Thes. 5:6</h1><p>The Sadducees who did not believe in resurrection came to the Lord Jesus one day and asked, "Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother. Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first married and died, and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother; likewise also the second and the third until the seventh. And last of all the woman died. In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her" (Matt. 22:24-28). If we had been confronted with such a problem, we would surely have thought that this was a rare and strange question. There were seven brothers who married the same woman and had no children, and they all died one after the other. This is a very hypothetical question. The Sadducees were trying to catch Jesus with this question and disprove resurrection. But the Bible shows us that even if there had been such a case, it would not have put Jesus into a corner. Our Lord Jesus struck them with His opening remark: "You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God." The Lord Jesus said that they erred! The Sadducees erred! They erred in their view! They erred in their question! Why would they even think of such a strange thing and come up with such an absurd question through their own cleverness? Why would they not believe in resurrection? Why had they erred? The Lord Jesus pointed out clearly that they erred because they did not know the Scriptures nor the power of God.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we are not focusing on the interpretation of this passage. Rather, we want to extract an important principle from this portion of the Scriptures. Although this passage is on the error of the Sadducees, it also points out the proper attitude of a Christian. Although a Christian has believed in the Lord, it is still possible for him to err. He can still err, and worse still, he can err without realizing it because he does not know the Scriptures and does not know the power of God. Brothers and sisters, in order to go on properly in the spiritual pathway, serve well in the Lord's work, and satisfy God's heart in the way we handle our affairs in the church, in expounding the Bible, or in our daily life, and in order to keep from falling into error, we must know the Scriptures and the power of God.</p><p>Second Timothy 3:16-17 tells us, "All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work." We cannot find a good Christian who has a desire to please the Lord but who does not know God's word. God's speaking to man today is based on what He has spoken in the Scriptures. The Bible has clearly unveiled God's will, desire, pleasure, and displeasure to us. Psalm 119:105 says, "Your word is a lamp to my feet/And a light for my path." In order to avoid getting lost and stumbling on the spiritual pathway, we need light. The word of God is a lamp to our feet and a light for our path. If we want to go on in the spiritual pathway and not fall into error, we have to follow the Bible. Another verse in the same psalm says, "In my heart I have treasured up Your word/That I might not sin against You" (v. 11). If we want to be one who does not sin against the Lord, we have to let His word dwell in our heart richly. If God's children would spend time to study the Bible, taking it as their unique guidepost and fearing the word of God, they would not fall into grave errors.</p><p>Today we have not only the Holy Bible but also the Holy Spirit within us. In the New Testament age, God has put His law within us. This law is the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2; it is also the anointing in 1 John 2:27. This anointing teaches us all things. If we do not quench the Spirit and if we learn to obey the teaching of the anointing within us, we will not fall into error. God's children err in the spiritual pathway because they do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God. In the past, some have emphasized the matter of miracles and works of wonders exclusively. They publicize these miracles and works of wonders, and many people are attracted by these things. There are others who always talk about visions and dreams. They relate their visions and dreams to others, teaching others these things and assuming the role of a great prophet or great apostle. Sometimes they may even have supernatural powers and point out the hidden things in man. They may attract many immature believers who follow them and inquire of them like great prophets. Still others pray in a strange way, repeating one sentence over and over again, and praying this way hundreds of times. Some even claim that the Lord Jesus has come the second time already or that He will come on a certain date of a certain year. Brothers and sisters, if we search the Scriptures carefully, we will learn the questionable nature of these practices. In the following sections we will consider these practices.</p><h2 class="head1">MIRACLES AND WORKS OF WONDERS</h2><p>I believe in miracles. I believe that the Lord Jesus healed the sick and cast out demons. He is the Son of God, and it is a natural thing for Him to perform miracles. He is the Creator of heaven and earth; healing and casting out demons are small things to Him. But in the Bible, when men tempted the Lord and asked Him for a miracle, He would not grant their request (Matt. 16:1-4). The Lord did not want people to believe in Him because of miracles (John 4:48). After He healed someone on earth, He would charge him not to publicize it and not to speak about it (Matt. 8:4; Mark 5:43; 7:36). Our Lord Jesus does not want men to follow Him out of curiosity. Even when many believed in Him because of the miracles, He would not commit Himself to them (John 2:23-24). In John 6 five thousand ate of the loaves and the fishes that the Lord gave, yet in the end they forsook Him. Real knowledge of the Lord is not based on outward miracles and works of wonders but on the word of God and the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>We believe that the seventy disciples were able to subdue the demons (Luke 10:17). We also believe that Peter, John, Stephen, and Paul all performed miracles, healed the sick, and cast out demons (Acts 3:2-8; 6:8; 9:36-41; 14:8-18; 16:16-18; 28:1-6). We believe the words of Mark 16:17, which says, "And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name..." But the Bible shows us that we should not rally men around us or attract them by miracles, works of wonders, healings, and the casting out of demons, because these things are not the center of salvation; they cannot occupy too great of a place. The only thing we should exalt is the Lord's name.</p><p>It is not scriptural for anyone to exclusively seek after miracles and works of wonders or for anyone to exclusively speak about these things. Those who do can be easily deceived and obsessed by Satan because the false prophet and Antichrist can also perform great miracles and wonders (Matt. 24:24; Mark 13:22; 2 Thes. 2:9-12). Therefore, brothers and sisters, we should have a proper understanding of the power of God and not be curious about miracles and works of wonders.</p><h2 class="head1">VISIONS AND DREAMS</h2><p>It is true that in the Old Testament God taught His people by means of visions and dreams at times. But instances of this nature were not very frequent. In the New Testament, particularly after the coming of the Holy Spirit, there were even less occurrences. Although there are still cases of visions and dreams, this only happens for a special reason because in the New Testament age, the Holy Spirit is in us and God is teaching us all things through the anointing. God wants us to know His heart according to the Bible on one hand, and according to the sense of life on the other hand. The New Testament mentions a few cases of visions and dreams. For example, at the house of Simon the tanner, Peter saw the great sheet with all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven in it (Acts 10:9-12). Why did the Lord give Peter such a vision? It was because Peter had a deep prejudice against the Gentiles at that time. The Lord used the vision to remove his prejudice and open the way for the gospel to go to the Gentiles at that time. Paul also saw a few visions. Twice when he was in peril, God comforted and strengthened him through visions (18:9; 27:23-24). Another time Paul saw a Macedonian standing and entreating him in a vision, saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us." After Paul saw the vision, he was ready to go. But the writer of the Bible added, "...concluding that God had called us to announce the gospel to them" (16:9-10). The use of the word "concluding" means that Paul did not consider the vision as the only means of guidance. Visions and dreams have their place in the Bible, but they cannot be our only guidance. Even after one has received a vision or a dream, the guidance must still conform to the Scriptures, the teaching of the anointing within, and circumstantial arrangements. After Peter saw the vision at Joppa, there was an immediate confirmation in the environment&mdash;Cornelius sent men to him. Hence, a vision or a dream is reliable only if it matches the words of the Scriptures, the teaching of the anointing, and the confirmation of the environment. Furthermore, visions and dreams must also be meaningful and purposeful. In the New Testament age, visions and dreams are not God's usual means of giving guidance to men. Even when a person has a vision or a dream, this does not mean that he must tell others about it. Paul had the experience of the third heaven, yet he spoke only reluctantly about it after fourteen years (2 Cor. 12:1-6). If a man always claims that he is seeing visions and dreams, there must be some problem with his mind.</p><p>We must realize that many sudden thoughts are injected into our mind by evil spirits from outside of us. Some believers experience flashes of thoughts in their mind which supposedly give them understanding, realization, and revelation of some special things or suggestions to do this or that. These thoughts should be rejected because they are not from the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The evil spirits not only inject thoughts into the believers' mind, but they display all kinds of images in their mind. Some are wonderful images that the believers love, while others are filthy ones that their conscience abhors. But whether they are beautiful or ugly, good or bad, as long as a believer does not have the strength to stop these images from coming into his mind, it means that he is already deceived.</p><p>There are natural dreams and supernatural dreams. Some of them are from God, and some of them are from the devil. Except the dreams that are produced as a result of man's physiological and psychological activities, all other dreams are supernatural. Some believers are mentally unstable as a result of shock or illness. They open their mind to evil spirits because they do not know the Bible, and as a result, they are filled with dreams. We must realize that dreams from God make a person normal, peaceful, stable, sensible, and conscious, while dreams from evil spirits are always strange, vain, absurd, foolish, and irrational.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, do not think that all visions and dreams are good. We must remember that many visions and dreams are not from God. We must not receive them; rather, we must reject them. Only then will we not be deceived.</p><p>Some people are psychologically ill or deceived by evil spirits. They may even be possessed by evil spirits or demons. In their mind they have some kind of illusion. They are often proud and subjective. They often think that they are great prophets or apostles raised up by God. We must realize that a man who is deceived by evil spirits is one who is very self-confident; he does not easily take the advice of others, and he does not easily believe in the feeling of other brothers and sisters. These visions and dreams attract ignorant, immature, and curious believers because they have a supernatural element. They think that they are great prophets and apostles raised up by God, and other immature believers also think that they are great prophets and apostles. Some even go to them and inquire of them as if they were God. This is absolutely unscriptural. The Bible shows us in the New Testament that there are only prophets in the church; God does not allow any of His children to be a prophet to an individual. In the New Testament, God's law is not written in outward tablets of stone but in our heart (Heb. 8:10). Everyone who has the life of God has this innate ability to know God's desire. In the New Testament, God does not allow anyone to be a prophet to an individual or to substitute for a believer's knowing of God's will. We must ask the Lord to deliver us from curiosity so that we do not fall into deception.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE COMING OF THE LORD</h2><p>We believe in the second coming of the Lord Jesus. This is our fundamental faith. But the Bible does not tell us the day the Lord will come. "But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but the Father only" (Matt. 24:36). "And Jesus answered and said to them, See that no one leads you astray. For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray" (vv. 4-5). "At that time if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here! do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen....Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth; Behold, He is in the inner rooms, do not believe it" (vv. 23-26). "Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour" (25:13).</p><p>We can find similar words in Mark 13. The Lord told the disciples clearly, "See that no one leads you astray. Many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ! and will lead many astray" (vv. 5-6). "And then if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! Behold, there! do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, the chosen. But you, beware" (vv. 21-23). "But concerning that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father. Beware, be alert; for you do not know when the time is" (vv. 32-33).</p><p>Paul said in 2 Thessalonians, "That you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. Let no one deceive you in any way" (2:2-3a). "The coming of whom is according to Satan's operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie" (v. 9).</p><p>When the Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples concerning His coming, He reminded them again and again to "beware" (Mark 13:23, 33) or "take heed" (v. 9) or to "see" (v. 5). This word in Greek is repeated four times in Mark 13. He also reminded the disciples to be "alert" (v. 33) or to "watch" (v. 35, 37). This word in Greek is repeated three times in Mark 13. Therefore, brothers and sisters, concerning the coming of the Lord, we should beware, and we should watch. We should pray, and we should wait. We should be ready daily to welcome the return of our Lord and wait for Him by being watchful and praying. The Bible does not allow us to do any foolish things such as counting the days or predicting the time of the Lord's coming. If anyone says that the Lord will come on a certain day of a certain month, we have to beware and not be deceived by these words.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYING WITH ONE SENTENCE</h2><p>Some people pray with one sentence repeatedly, such as "praise the Lord, praise the Lord," or "hallelujah, hallelujah." They repeat the sentence over and over again and pray with a loud voice. It is easy to cause the mind to be blank in this way. It leads a person into all kinds of strange experiences, such as deception by evil spirits. All the time, however, the person thinks that he is being filled by the Holy Spirit. Ecclesiastes tells us that when we pray to God, we must not be rash with our mouth or let our heart be hasty to utter any thing before God (5:2). The Lord also teaches us not to babble empty words when we pray (Matt. 6:7). Prayer is not a kind of chanting of Scriptures. It is not to repeat a word over and over again. Prayer is telling the Lord what is in our heart (Phil. 4:6). The Bible teaches us to be quiet and to not be in confusion but to do things becomingly and in order (1 Cor. 14:33, 40). Therefore brothers and sisters, we need to be in fear and trembling and be watchful in prayer. We should not believe in ourselves too much but learn to be led by the indwelling Spirit within us so that we can learn to obey the teaching of the anointing. At the same time, we have to understand the Bible and reject anything that is not according to the Bible. We know that the Lord Jesus overcame the temptation of Satan with the word of God when He was tried in the wilderness. We should spend time to study the Bible and should allow the word of God to dwell richly in our heart, lest we be led astray by the many strange teachings.</p><p>We thank the Lord that He has given two great treasures to the church. One is the Holy Bible, and the other is the Holy Spirit. If we truly follow the Bible and the Spirit, we will not err. Brothers and sisters, how easy it is for us to err, and how easy it is for us to be deceived and cheated. We have to remember Paul's word in 1 Thessalonians 5:6, which says that we should not sleep but should watch and be sober. If we do not search the Scriptures carefully, if we do not take the Bible as the lamp to our feet and light for our path, if we do not submit to the authority of the Spirit in fear and trembling, watching and praying at all times, and if we do not have a fear of falling into error, we are indeed in poverty and darkness! We need to prostrate ourselves at the feet of the Lord and ask for His shining and His preservation. We have to ask Him to give us a firm determination to pay any price to please Him, to reject anything that is not according to the Scriptures, and to accept everything that is according to the Scriptures. At the same time, we should submit to the authority of the Holy Spirit and not make any proposals of our own or have any considerations of our own. We should not act according to our own will or teach others or serve the Lord according to the preference of our flesh. May the Lord be merciful to the church, and may He preserve the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">MIRACLES ARE SPONTANEOUS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 16:17-18; Psa. 72:18</h1><p>In Mark 16:17-18 the Lord Jesus spoke to the eleven disciples. He said, "And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well." These two verses cover the matter of miracles. How should we view these two verses?</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>We have to pay attention to one thing: No one can make a performance out of any part of God's Word, and no part of God's Word can be performed by man. Man is incapable of performing not only these two verses in Mark 16 but also any part of the Scriptures. God answered the prayer of Elijah on Mount Carmel by sending down fire, but this was only for the purpose of proving that Jehovah was God and that Baal was not God (1 Kings 18:30-39). God is willing to use miracles to prove Himself and prove that He is God. But He is not willing to allow man to use miracles as a kind of performance. Some try to perform the verses in Mark 16, but God does not honor their performance; He allows them to fail. You cannot say that they do not believe in the word of Mark 16; they believe. But God will not vindicate them; He will not prove Himself to them because He is God. He only does what He wants to do; He will not work according to man's wish.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>We have to remember a spiritual principle: Faith is a spontaneous and effortless thing. Christians who are immature in their faith find it very strenuous to make God answer their prayers. Every time they try to get an answer from God, they have to pump up much faith. They have to consciously exercise their faith. It seems as if they are saying, "I am believing! I am believing!" Although their prayers are answered, they become worn out in their believing. After they learn the proper lesson, they still pray, they still believe, and God answers their prayer. But they no longer have to exert much effort. They pray spontaneously, and God answers their prayers spontaneously. Previously they exerted considerable strength to believe; it seemed as if their heart and energy were drained through such an exercise of faith. They wanted to believe, yet they could not believe. They did not find faith in themselves, and they tired themselves out by such believing. But after they learn the lesson, their faith is spontaneous; it becomes an effortless faith.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Faith is spontaneous, and so are miracles. Those who perform miracles are never conscious that they are performing miracles. To those who have faith in God, miracles are ordinary things. Only those who are far from God think that miracles are something extraordinary. Those who live in the presence of God and who are near God do not think that miracles are extraordinary.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have read the story of the Israelites' crossing the Red Sea. The first time we read the story, we thought that it was an extraordinary event. It was a tremendous thing for so many people to cross the Red Sea at one time! Yet what did the Israelites say? The Bible does not record that they exclaimed, "What a wonder! The sea is about to divide itself!", while they were still on the [Egyptian] side of the sea. Nor did they say, "Behold, what a miracle!" Only after they arrived at the other side did they begin to make a song and sing. They realized that it was a great miracle only as they looked back. The same is true with believers today. While God is performing a miracle for them, they do not realize that it is a miracle. Only when they look back do they realize that they have experienced a miracle. Brothers and sisters, consider the many times that you were sick and God healed you. Did you feel something extraordinary at the time you were healed? No. When you encountered difficulties and God delivered you, were you conscious that something momentous had occurred at the time of His deliverance? No. Only when you looked back did you realize that great things had happened. Even the looking back is spontaneous; one does not look back consciously.</p><p>Some have misunderstood the words in Mark 16:17-18. They look at these two verses with human eyes and consider them as something extraordinary. But brothers and sisters, once we consider God, we will not feel that there is anything extraordinary about them. These are very small acts compared with the Israelites' crossing the Red Sea. Does this mean that a believer can take poison every day and not die? No. If a man purposefully tries to take poison, he will surely die. These verses tell us that if we know what kind of God He is and the power of God, we will realize that there is nothing He cannot do. Miracles are not the result of a strenuous exercise of man's faith. Miracles are the manifestation of the power of God. God is the only One who does wondrous things; when He works, we have miracles. Once God moves His hand, we no longer feel that miracles are a difficult thing. The trouble today is that man views miracles from a distance that is far from God; therefore, miracles are regarded as something spectacular. Those who are near God realize that miracles are a common thing in the house of God.</p><p>There was a girl who lived by the sea and whose relatives were fishers. Later she married a man from the mountains. The mountain people were secluded and much poorer; they had a meager living. One day her father-in-law became very angry with her, and he condemned her for not being thrifty and for squandering the household goods because she ate one crab within three days. He angrily went to his in-laws, who invited him to stay for supper. He saw many dishes of crab at the table, and when he looked at the porch, countless crab shells could be seen. When he saw this, he decided not to complain anymore and returned home. Many people value miracles in the same way that the father-in-law valued crabs. They experience a miracle once every ten or thirty years. Therefore, they consider a miracle as a rare thing. But those who live before God consider miracles to be an ordinary thing. God's hand is the source of the miracles, and God Himself is constantly performing miracles.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Hence, there is no need for anyone to struggle to perform miracles. When God's power is manifested in us, there are miracles. Paul was bitten by a viper, and he shook it off into the fire (Acts 28:3-5). How did Paul perform that miracle? He did not tell the men of the island of Malta, "Come and see me perform a great miracle for you." He shook the snake into the fire without any fanfare. There was no promotion of any kind. Only those who do not know God promote miracles; those who know God do not promote miracles. (This does not mean that those who do not promote miracles know God. Some do not believe in God or miracles.) Those who know God do not promote miracles because miracles are spontaneous things for them. Brothers and sisters, when God answers your prayer and you feel that you have done something marvelous, it proves that your faith is very immature. If you really believe in the power of God, you will find Him answering your prayers and performing miracles without even being conscious of it. Under such circumstances, miracles are spontaneous. There is no need for any struggle, and they will not be extraordinary.</p><p>We must realize that miracles are not performed in a conscious way. If we feel that we are performing miracles, we have failed already. In other words, when we set our mind to perform miracles, they will be far from us. This is like setting our mind to do good; we discover that we cannot. When we live in the presence of God and believe in Him, there will be miracles spontaneously. The miracle of not being hurt by the viper was done without Paul's even noticing it. If others asked him to do the same thing again, he might not be able to repeat it. If someone asked us to repeat what Paul did, we could not do it either. We cannot imitate others, and we cannot reenact our own experience. We are touching a very important principle of the Christian experience. In our Christian experience, God's answer to our prayer and His miracles follow one basic principle&mdash;everything is spontaneous, and everything is done without our awareness. In the beginning, we may think that we had much strength and great faith. But as we go on and learn more, we will no longer feel the same way. To some degree, we will not even know how we believed. We simply commit things into God's hand, and things are done spontaneously.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>In Paul we see many miracles and works of wonders. Yet Paul said of himself, "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling" (1 Cor. 2:3). God is willing to work through man. But He is not willing to allow man to become conscious of what he can do. Only those who do not know God say that they can do this and that. Those who genuinely know God say that they do not know what they can do. A man whom God truly uses will not feel that he can do this or that. Whatever he has done is behind him. Thank God, His power is so great that He can do everything Himself. We do not have to do anything. The more we go on as a Christian, the simpler we become. Those who become complicated are wrong. The more we know God, the simpler we become. We are just what we are. Even our believing will not be as strenuous as before. Day by day as we live before the Lord, we will become simpler and simpler. We will say genuinely from our heart that everything is of God and not of us. Brothers and sisters, if we truly know God, we will know that all of His work in us is spontaneous.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">LET THE WORD OF GOD<br />DWELL IN YOUR HEART RICHLY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:16</h1><p>Many of God's children live in poverty because they have not allowed the word of God to dwell in them richly, as Colossians tells us to do. The first cause of spiritual poverty or the first step toward spiritual poverty among Christians is poverty in the Word of God. A man who is poor in the eyes of God may read through the Bible page by page and chapter by chapter, but he will not know God's Word. He has not made any contact with God and he does not find any life in the Word. Therefore, he is poor.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>There was a brother who had believed and been baptized for a year. He met an elderly Christian who asked him three questions which he found difficult to answer. The three questions were as follows:</p><p>First, the man asked, "Since you became a Christian a year ago, have you read through the Bible once?" He realized that this was a hard question. If he were asked whether he had read the Bible, it would have been easy to answer because he read his Bible every day. If he were asked whether he had spent time to study the Bible, he could also answer because he spent much time to study it. But it was not easy to answer that he had read through the Bible. He said, "I read the Bible every day." The man retorted, "I am not asking whether you have read the Bible every day. I am asking whether you have read through the whole Bible." He could not dodge the question and said, "I read it every day, but I have not yet read through it once." The man exclaimed, "You have been a Christian for over a year, and you have not read through the Bible once!" The two were silent for a few minutes. The brother said in his heart, "Lord, if you give me another year, I will surely read through the Bible at least once."</p><p>The man would not let him go. He asked the second question: "You have been a Christian for over a year. Have you prayed?" He answered, "I pray daily, and every Saturday I go to the hill to pray." The man asked again, "Since you have prayed so much, how many times has God answered your prayer? Try to remember, have you received at least one clear answer to any of your prayers?" He thought for a moment, but it was difficult for him to think of one case! He had prayed much, but he could not name one instance when God answered his prayer. He could only admit, "I am afraid not once." The man said, "You have been a Christian for over a year, yet God has not answered your prayer once!"</p><p>Following this, there was the third question: "You have been a Christian for over a year. Have you led one person to the Lord? Is there anyone who has come to the Lord clearly as a result of your preaching?" He knew that he had preached the gospel, but it was hard to say whether there was one particular person who had been led to the Lord by him. It seemed as if there was one, but he dared not say for sure. He had to answer, "No." The man did not ask any more questions but merely sighed, "You have believed in the Lord for over a year. But you have not read through the Bible once, received one answer to prayer, nor led one person to the Lord." At that very moment, the brother resolved in his mind, saying, "Lord, I will lead at least one to You this year, I will pray until I have at least one definite answer to prayer, and I will read through the Bible at least once."</p><p>From that day on, that brother had a new start. He was determined to read the Bible through from beginning to end. He counted the number of books and chapters in the Old and New Testament, and he scheduled his time. He believed that he could devote considerable time for this. He thought that he could read through the Old Testament at least three times and the New Testament twelve or fourteen times. Thank the Lord that by the end of that year, God enabled him to finish more than what had been scheduled. From that point on, he began to study the Bible conscientiously and studiously.</p><p>I would ask the young brothers and sisters in particular: How much of God's Word do you read every day? Have you read through the Word of God once? In your spiritual pursuit, it is easy to have lofty aspirations while neglecting basic lessons. If you have not read through God's Word properly from beginning to end, and if you are still skipping through it here and there, I would advise you to change your way of reading. You must have a proper plan for reading the Bible. Every day you have to spend some time to systematically read God's Word from beginning to end. In reading a book, you would not reap much benefit if you skipped through it here and there. You cannot read the Bible this way either; you have to read it systematically through from beginning to end. You have to start from Genesis and go all the way to Malachi, and you have to start from Matthew and go all the way to Revelation. You have to read systematically, according to a schedule. Otherwise, ten years will pass and you will still be very poor in God's Word.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>There are many ways of reading the Bible. Reading it through sequentially from beginning to end is only one way of reading it. There is another way of reading, which a Christian should practice as soon as he begins his Christian life. This is reading early in the morning. There is one condition for this kind of reading of the Word&mdash;one has to rise up early every morning. It is another matter if you are sick and you are told by a doctor to rest. But every normal, healthy person should rise up early. When the sun comes out, the manna is gone. Many people read the Bible too late; therefore, they cannot read it well. You must catch the early morning hour to read God's Word.</p><p>However, no one can rise up early if he goes to bed late. It is another matter if some are required to stay up late by their work. But many people have no special reason to go to bed late; they have built up the habit of putting things off until the evening. When they go to bed late, they cannot rise early. Some people are not busy at all; they just like to waste their time at night. They like to stay a little longer in the sitting room and chat a little longer, and before they know it, half an hour has passed. Whoever wastes or ill-manages his time this way will find it hard to rise up early; it will be hard for him to do anything in a systematic way. We have to develop the habit of retiring to bed on time and rising on time. Many people are very weak when it comes to the matter of rising. They cannot control themselves and cannot rise up early to touch the Lord. As soon as possible, young Christians should develop the habit of rising early. They may find it hard the first day; however, by the second or third day, they will not find it as hard. After a period of time, it will become natural to them.</p><p>One brother was determined to rise up between half-past four and five o'clock in the morning. When he woke up the first morning, it was six o'clock. When he woke up the second morning, it was six o'clock again. He was determined to get up at five. The next night he constantly looked at the clock and did not sleep well from two until five in the morning. He realized that this was not right, because when he did not sleep well at night, it was harder for him to rise up in the morning. He realized that the only thing he could do was look to the Lord. On the third night, he prayed, "God, I am going to sleep now. I commit myself to Your hand. Please wake me up at five tomorrow morning." Then he went to sleep soundly. The next morning when he woke up, he was afraid that it was six o'clock again. But thank the Lord, it was exactly five o'clock; it was not a minute late or early. From that day on and for many years, he woke up at the right time. We believe that when we truly commit ourselves to God, He will wake us up.</p><p>I am not saying that everyone should rise up at five o'clock. If you can rise up earlier, it is good. But if you have some hardship, you may need to rise up later. We do not suggest going to an extreme. We all have to judge ourselves according to our physical strength. We have to learn how many hours of sleep we need and when we need to go to bed. Then we will know when we can get up in the morning, whether it is five o'clock, half-past five, or six o'clock. We have to plan well before the Lord. Once we make our plan, we can rise up every morning according to our plan to read God's Word.</p><p>We can testify that reading the Word early in the morning is the best nourishment for our spiritual life. We can read the Bible at other times, but reading it in the morning has a different flavor to it, and it reaps special benefits for us. If we have not experienced the benefit of reading the Word early in the morning, I hope that we will start practicing it and will not miss out on this blessing.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Colossians 3:16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom." We have to let the Word dwell in us. We should not only memorize it, but we should also digest it into our heart. The Lord taught us to pray for God to give us this day our daily food. We should ask the Lord to give us our daily food. Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of the Lord. Therefore, we must pray for God to give us not only physical food but also spiritual food and to teach us the way to eat this food so that we can store the word in our heart.</p><p>Our reading of the Word in the morning should be different from our ordinary reading; we should not read through it sequentially. Instead, while we read, we should meditate and pray. After reading one or two sentences, we should begin to pray. Never read without stopping. You have to pray in order to mingle your reading with prayer. These prayers do not have to be like ordinary prayers in which we say, "In the name of Jesus, amen." This prayer is a mingling of reading with praying. On the one hand, we read God's Word, and on the other hand, we speak to God through prayer. We have the Word of God before us, and we read it to ourselves as well as to God. While we are reading, we should pray. We should not read through hastily but digest the Word as we read slowly. If we do this, we will receive nourishment from the Word.</p><p>For example, Isaiah 54:1 says, "Give a ringing shout, O barren one, you who have not borne;/Break forth into joyful shouting and cry out, you who have not been in labor; /For more numerous are the children of the desolate one/Than the children of the married woman, says Jehovah." This means that the Lord can give man through the Spirit what he does not have in his flesh. When you read this verse, you should meditate on it and pray, "Lord, I am barren, and I have not borne anything. Spiritually speaking, I have nothing to give others. But I thank and praise You. I can sing because You can give to me what I do not have; You have the power."</p><p>Whichever portion you may come across, you can meditate on it and pray over it. Some people say that they do not have enough items to pray about. Actually there are enough items for you to pray about in the Bible already. Whatever you read can become the subject of your prayer. Many things in the Bible can lead you to pray, utter a praise, confess your sins, and make supplication for others.</p><p>When you come across a commandment of God, you may pray to Him saying, "God, forgive my sins, for I am weak. I have not obeyed You in this matter. I do not have this thing, and I am not this kind of person. Lord, forgive me." You may think of others and confess for others. You can say, "Lord, I cannot make it. I look to You to accomplish this in me." God wants you to be faithful. You can look to Him to make you faithful. God intends that you love. You can look to Him to make you love. When you read God's command in this way, you will find that all of God's commands are actually His promises. When God gives you a command, He also gives you the strength to keep that command. If you only see God's command and feel that He is giving you a hard time by asking you to do what cannot possibly be done, you have not seen that His commands are with promises. Remember the story of the young ruler in Luke 18. He heard the Lord Jesus' word, "Still you lack one thing: all that you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me" (v. 22), and he left in sorrow. He thought he could keep the Ten Commandments, but he could not do this one thing. He thought this commandment of the Lord was too harsh. But shortly thereafter, the Lord showed that His commandments are not merely commandments but promises as well. He said, "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God" (v. 27). Thank the Lord that His commandments show two things: man cannot make it and God can make it. Before His commandments, we have to see that we cannot make it and that He can make it. If we see only that we cannot make it, we become sorrowful. But if we see that God can make it, we will praise Him. Many times when we read God's Word, we realize that we cannot make it. Since the commandments are so severe, we pray, "Lord, I cannot make it. But I praise You because You can make it. This is impossible with man. Lord, I cannot do it. But with You, nothing is impossible. So I look to You to accomplish this in me today. Please come and accomplish this in me." If we pray this way, we will see God answering our prayer.</p><p>When we read and pray simultaneously this way and learn to read God's Word in God's presence, we will gradually touch the spirit within the Word and discover the vast difference between our condition and the spirit in the Word. For example, we may read Philippians 3:18-19: "For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose god is their stomach..." It is very easy for us to say that these are the enemies of God, and that their end is destruction. But it is difficult to touch the spirit of the writer of the Bible. If we read it casually through, we will not detect it. But if we pray while we read, we will read ourselves into the heart of the writer of the Epistle and see that he was full of love. One who was full of love was used by God to speak a severe word: "I have told you often and now tell you even weeping." Some had made their stomach their god. They were the enemies of the cross of Christ, and their end was destruction. This is a fact, and Paul had to write this. But while he was writing, he was full of love. It is very easy for us to speak severe words, but it is very difficult for us to have Paul's spirit. It is easy for us to be nice and speak nice words, but it is very difficult for us to speak severe words as he did. When we come to this portion and touch the spirit of the writer, we will know him as a person, and we will also know ourselves. If we do not touch the spirit when we read His Word, we will not have much feeling. But if we read and pray at the same time and our heart is turned to God and our spirit is open to Him, we will get into the Bible, and the Bible will no longer be dry and tasteless. It will be full of life-food, and while we are reading, we will be eating as well.</p><p>I hope that the brothers and sisters will read God's Word conscientiously every morning. Do not read it through quickly; pray as you read, and read as you pray. If you read this way for fifteen minutes, half an hour, or an hour every day, you will be fed and strengthened. If you eat God's Word today, you will find that the Lord is your strength today; He will carry you through everything.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>In addition to reading the Word in the morning, we must also spend time during other hours to study His Word. We have to read the Bible consistently, repeatedly, thoroughly, carefully, and systematically. Only then will the word of God dwell in our heart richly.</p><p>Other than our personal reading of the Word, we can also read a portion of the Word with the brothers and sisters when we meet together. It is also a big help to memorize the Word with other brothers and sisters. We may not understand one verse, but when it is recited through the mouth of another person, we suddenly understand it. This may sound strange, but it is a fact. Once the brothers and sisters come together, they will receive light which as individuals they cannot receive. Therefore, when brothers and sisters come together, it is better for you to not gossip. You can open the Word and read it. It does not matter if you do not understand it. Either one person can read while everyone else listens, or everyone can take turns reading. Or you may read the chapter you read today, while I read the chapter I read today. This kind of reading will uncover many hidden things in the Bible.</p><p>Reading the Bible is indispensable to a Christian. Young brothers and sisters should first develop a habit of rising early to read the Word. We believe that this kind of reading is most beneficial to the growth in life; it will unlock the power within God's Word. I am afraid that many Christians have been starving for a long time. They have been starving not only for a few days or a month but for many years! Perhaps some have never eaten God's Word from the time they became a Christian; they have never risen up early to eat God's Word. It is no wonder that they are so weak! Brothers and sisters, we have to eat God's Word. In the morning, we should pray and read God's Word simultaneously. This is to eat God's Word. May the Lord deliver us from spiritual poverty. May He deliver us from any form of poverty in His Word so that we may have the word of God dwelling in us richly and so that we will receive the supply of life from His Word daily.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">NUMBERING OUR DAYS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 90:12; Eph. 5:16-17; Joel 2:25</h1><p class="indent1">(Editor's Note: The following article was printed in the Chinese edition of Twelve Baskets Full, Volume 5, chapter twelve. It is similar in content to the article "The Numbering of Spiritual Days" published in Issue No. 47 of Notes on Scriptural Messages and reprinted in The Collected Works, Volume 19. However, there are variations in the arrangement of the material in these two articles. Since we do not have the assurance that this message is based on the same spoken message, we have included it in this volume.)</p><p>In the Psalms, Moses prayed to God, "Teach us then to number our days/That we may gain a heart of wisdom." If our days are numbered according to the calendar, then a day is a day and a year is a year; this is easy to understand. But if we take God's view, then some years and days will be numbered, while others will not be numbered. Our days on earth are limited. How should we please God within such a limited number of years and days? How can each day and each year of our life be counted? This is the subject of our study.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>There are two genealogies in Genesis 4 and 5. Chapter four is the genealogy of Cain, while chapter five is the genealogy of Seth. The way that the two genealogies are recorded is different. Cain's genealogy is very simple; it does not record the age of Cain and his descendants. Seth's genealogy is much more detailed; it tells us how old each person was when he begot offspring and how many years he lived. It records the ages of generation after generation. Based on the fact that one genealogy is simple and the other is detailed, we can trace God's principle in numbering our days. Cain's genealogy was simple because he offended God and was far away from God. He did not have any fellowship with God. Seth's genealogy was detailed because Seth replaced Abel and was acceptable to God; he fellowshipped with God. Hence, our spiritual days are reckoned according to our condition before the Lord. When we were far from God and dead in sin, our days were not reckoned in the sight of the Lord. But when we repented, turned to God, and began to fellowship with Him, our spiritual days began.</p><p>When the Israelites left Egypt, God commanded them, saying, "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you" (Exo. 12:2). The first month is the beginning of the year; it is the starting point of reckoning. In this month the Israelites killed the Passover lamb, left Egypt, and freed themselves from the bondage of Pharaoh. Hence, God charged them to call this month the first month. From this month forward, the Israelites had a new beginning before the Lord.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, how much spiritual history do you have? Some of you are quite old; you may be fifty or sixty years old. But spiritually, you are still only one year or even one month old. Your spiritual age began the day you were regenerated and saved. The day you received the Lord's salvation was the day your spiritual history began. Before that day, no spiritual years were counted before the Lord. However, even after you believed in the Lord, one year does not necessarily mean one year. You may have been a Christian for five years, but in the eyes of God, you may not be five years old as a Christian. In other words, even after you become a Christian, some days and years are not counted in God's sight. We can see from the Bible that some years were skipped over because God considered them to be wasted, and they could not be counted. He also records some years in the Bible to serve as our warning. We will consider the following passages and draw some lessons from them.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>How many years were there from the time the Israelites left Egypt to the time of the building of Solomon's temple? Acts 13:18-22 says, "And for a time of about forty years He carried them as a nurse in the wilderness. And when He had overthrown seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an inheritance. And after these things, for about four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. And afterward they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. And when He had deposed him, He raised up David for them as king." (David was king for forty years&mdash;2 Sam. 5:4.) How many years were there from the exodus to the fourth year of King Solomon when he built the temple? It was forty plus four hundred fifty plus forty plus forty, which equals five hundred seventy. If we add the three years prior to the building of the temple, we have five hundred seventy-three years. Yet 1 Kings 6:1 says, "And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the Lord." This verse says four hundred eighty years rather than five hundred seventy-three years&mdash;a difference of ninety-three years! Why is there such a great difference? Is Acts wrong or is 1 Kings wrong? No, both records are right. A spiritual principle is involved in the discrepancy between the two numbers. In Acts, the record of the forty years in the wilderness is correct, the record of the forty years of Saul's reign is correct, and the record of the forty years of David is also correct. The temple was built in the fourth year of Solomon's reign; therefore, it is right to add three years to that period. The discrepancy is in the four-hundred-fifty-year period. First Kings has ninety-three years less than Acts. Where did these ninety-three years go? In studying Judges, we discover a fact: During that period, the Israelites were subdued by heathen tribes several times. Let us see how many years they were under oppression.</p><p>Judges 3:8 says, "Therefore the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia. And the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years." This was the first period of oppression the Israelites suffered; it lasted for eight years. Verse 14 says, "And the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years." This was the second period of oppression the Israelites suffered; it lasted for eighteen years. Judges 4:2-3 says, "And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. And the captain of his army was Sisera, who dwelt at Harosheth-hagoyim. And the children of Israel cried out to Jehovah; for he had nine hundred iron chariots, and he oppressed the children of Israel severely twenty years." This was the third period of oppression the Israelites suffered; it lasted for twenty years. Judges 6:1 says, "Then the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years." This was the fourth period of oppression the Israelites suffered; it lasted for seven years. Judges 13:1 says, "Then the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years." This was the fifth period of oppression the Israelites suffered; this bondage under the Philistines lasted for forty years. How many years were there in the five periods of oppression by the heathen tribes? There were eight plus eighteen plus twenty plus seven plus forty. How many years were there? There were exactly ninety-three years, no more and no less. Now we understand the discrepancy between the records in 1 Kings and Acts. In Acts, Paul was speaking about history; therefore, he included the ninety-three years. The emphasis in 1 Kings is on the condition of the Israelites before the Lord, and the ninety-three years were not counted. This is why it says four hundred eighty years.</p><p>It is very meaningful that ninety-three years were not counted. These years were lost years. Whenever the Israelites lost their freedom, served heathen tribes, and did not have a judge, their days were not reckoned. The Israelites belonged to God; they were saved from Egypt already. Whenever they were subdued by their enemies and became slaves, whenever they were in bondage, and whenever they could not serve God freely, their days were not counted. When they served something other than God, their days were lost and not counted in God's sight. Brothers and sisters, we should consider how many of the days since we were saved have been counted before the Lord. Perhaps we have believed in the Lord for eight or ten years. How many days during these years have we lived foolishly? How many days in the past have been struck out? We have too many wasted days! I doubt whether the days that can be counted before the Lord add up to a year. We must realize that the days that we live according to man's desire, the days that we live apart from God, and the days of failure and decline are not counted in God's eyes. We have been Christians for many years. Let us ask ourselves, "How many of these days have we wasted? How many of these days can be counted?" Every day that is not lived in fellowship with God is a lost day. Therefore brothers and sisters, we must all redeem the time.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>We must not think that the days we have lost are a few, unimportant days. If we consider the journey the Israelites took in the wilderness, we will realize how serious it is to waste our days. Three months after the Israelites left Egypt, they came to Sinai (Exo. 19:1). They remained there for ten months. On the twentieth day of the second month in the second year, they left Sinai and traveled toward the land God promised to give them for their inheritance (Num. 10:11-12). Deuteronomy 1:2 says, "It is eleven days' journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by the way that leads to Mount Seir." Kadesh-barnea was at the border of the land of Canaan. It was only an eleven-day journey from Mount Sinai to Canaan. Yet when they arrived at Kadesh-barnea, they could not enter Canaan because of their unbelief. After this they wandered in the wilderness for thirty-eight years before their descendants finally entered Canaan. This was indeed a big, indirect route! It took not just three or five years but thirty-eight years. They spent thirty-eight years on a journey to Canaan that should have taken them only two years! In our spiritual journey, there are countless wasted days. Some problems can be dealt with in three to five days, yet they remain unsolved in some people for three to five years. These ones are like the Israelites, who circled around in the wilderness and wasted many days. This is a great loss. We should not consider it to be inconsequential.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>The story of Abraham also shows us that parts of his life were counted and parts were not counted. According to Acts 7:2-3, while Abraham was still in Mesopotamia (i.e., in Ur), God appeared to him, saying, "Come out from your land and from your relatives, and come into the land which I will show you." What did he do? He would not have had peace if he did not obey; yet he was not willing to obey completely. As a result, he partially obeyed. God told him to come out from his relatives, yet he took his relatives along. He did not go alone; rather, he brought his nephew Lot and his father Terah with him. God intended that he go all the way to Canaan. Yet he went only as far as Haran and stayed there (Gen. 11:31). This is the picture of a Christian who is not willing to be absolute. Some Christians are not altogether cold; they still have some glow in them. Yet they are not hot. This was Abraham's condition. He left Ur of the Chaldees, yet he did not enter Canaan. He was like a halfway Christian.</p><p>After his father Terah died, God called Abraham again (12:1). This time, God called him from Haran. God's will cannot be changed. Once He has decided to do something, He will always accomplish it. God wanted Abraham to go to Canaan, and Abraham's deterrence in Haran did not change His will at all. The first time God called Abraham, he only obeyed halfway. Therefore, God called him the second time. When Abraham obeyed God by leaving Haran, the Bible immediately points out that he was seventy-five years old (12:4). His years in Ur were not mentioned, and his years in Haran were not mentioned either. But the minute he left Haran for Canaan, the Bible points out that his age was seventy-five. This shows us a new beginning in his life. The days Abraham spent in Haran, the days he tarried halfway, were wasted days; God did not remember those days. Brothers and sisters, in looking back at our past, we find that there are numerous days we have lost! We must remember that God has no concern for the days in Haran. We often walk according to our self-will. We become lazy and seek our own comfort; we tarry halfway. These are days in Haran and days which will not be counted. In order to receive blessing from God, Abraham had to leave Haran. The year he was seventy-five years old was the year he left Haran. Until then the Bible did not record his age. Until then God did not consider that his age was worth mentioning. He wants man to obey Him in an absolute way!</p><p>These were not the only years Abraham wasted. He also suffered a loss in the course of begetting a son. God promised Abraham that he would have a son. Yet he took his wife's suggestion and married Hagar as his concubine. He committed the sin of presumptuousness in the eyes of God. Later, Hagar gave birth to a son; however, this son was born out of Abraham's fleshly energy rather than out of God's promise. At the end of Genesis 16, he is spoken of as being eighty-six years old. But at the beginning of chapter seventeen, he was ninety-nine years old. There was a gap of thirteen years. During those thirteen years, there is no record of anything concerning him. We do not see him building an altar, and God did not appear to him once. He did not receive any new revelation or promises. Those days were empty days and days of nothingness. Those were the days Ishmael grew up. We have to remember that this period of Abraham's life was wasted and lost. Brothers and sisters, have we received any new experience, new light, and new messages during the past few years? Was anyone saved through our hands during the past few years? Did anyone receive our help during the past few years? Have we received a deeper knowledge of God during the past few years? Have we gained a stronger assurance of His promises? Have we renewed our consecration to God? If we did not have any of these experiences, our days were wasted days. An older sister once said, "Every single day of a Christian's life should count for a day. This is the way to assure our reward." What a pity that ten days often do not add up to one day! Brothers and sisters, it would be wonderful if we could live our Christian life in a conscientious way. If we spend our days foolishly, rebelling against God, sinning, and walking according to our self-will, our days have been wasted in the eyes of the Lord; our time has been squandered away. What a waste this is!</p><p>Why does the Bible point out that Abraham's age was ninety-nine? It is because he was circumcised in that year. One year after he was circumcised, he begot Isaac. The meaning of circumcision is the removal of the flesh. If we walk according to the flesh, our years are wasted. May we start today by removing everything that is of the flesh and offering ourselves up fully on the altar, so that we will no longer waste our time. We should not wait for fifty years to find out that we have wasted forty-nine of them. We have to consider how many days we have wasted in foolishness and how many days we have left. If we are waiting for the Lord's coming every day, we will pay attention to the way we spend our days.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>The Lord spoke a parable in Matthew 20 concerning a householder looking for workmen for his vineyard. We have to pay attention to two words, "standing idle." The householder "went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place, and to those he said, You also go into the vineyard" (vv. 3-4). "And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and said to them, Why have you been standing here all the day idle?...You also go into the vineyard" (vv. 6-7). This parable shows us that God does not want us to be idle; He wants us to work. It also tells us that God has His sphere of work&mdash;His vineyard. We may say that we are very busy, and that we are not idle at all. But are we busy in the right place? If we are not working in the vineyard, how is that different from being idle? If we are not living in the will of God, it does not matter how much we have worked; in the eyes of God we are still idle. We may be very busy with our spiritual work, but in God's eyes we are very idle. The only work that God approves is work in the vineyard. The work in the vineyard is the work that is genuinely from God and for God. If our work is outside God's will, our days are idle days in the eyes of God. The householder told the ones standing at the eleventh hour, "Why have you been standing here all the day idle?" The entire day signifies man's whole life. Brothers and sisters, what about us? Are we idle, or are we working in the vineyard? Do not be mistaken. I am not saying that we have to quit our job and be a preacher. The most important thing is being clear about our standing and knowing that we are standing in the will of God in whatever we are doing. To work in the vineyard means to work according to God's will. There are many kinds of work in the vineyard. Some are digging the ground; others are sowing; still others are trimming. Whatever we do, as long as it is for the vineyard, it is good. We should not consider that it is God's work only when we work as certain people do or only when we do certain things. No, we do not have to do that. As long as our days are spent in the vineyard, they are counted.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, you may have been saved for three or five years. Or you may have been saved for ten or twenty years. How much time have you spent for the Lord? It is true that you have done much. But for whom are you doing these works? As long as you are sure that you are working according to God's will, everything will be fine. God has no intention that every Christian drop his job to be a gospel preacher. Sometimes it is contrary to God's will for someone to give himself up solely for gospel work. It is a matter of your heart and how much it is towards God. Hence, consecration is indispensable. From the day you were saved until now, if you have not had a heart for God, your life has been an idle one.</p><h2 class="head1">SIX</h2><p>Paul wrote to the Corinthians saying, "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. But neither yet now are you able" (1 Cor. 3:1-2). As far as I know, from the time Paul first preached at Corinth until the time he wrote 1 Corinthians, there was only a span of a few years. But Paul already felt that the Corinthian believers were not growing. He did not say that they had been Christians for only a few years and that it was understandable that they were immature. Paul said that they should have matured. Yet they had not grown and had wasted their days. They should have been strong enough to eat solid food, but they had wasted their days and were still fleshly babes. They should have been experienced in their obedience to the Lord, in their trust of the Lord, and in their pursuit of the Lord, and they should have been able to lead others. But they still did not know about these things. They had been Christians for a number of years, but they were still babes, and Paul felt that this was wrong. Brothers and sisters, if you think that you should be a babe because you have been saved for only a few years, you are wrong. How many years do you have in your life? How many years can you be a Christian? If you have been a believer for eight or ten years and are still the same as when you were regenerated&mdash;fleshly and babyish&mdash;you have wasted many days.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, how many years can you live on this earth? Seventy years? Eighty years? How short your life is! Within this short period, you have to subtract the years when you were not yet saved. How many years are left? Brothers and sisters, do you know how many more years you will live on this earth? You have lived sixty years. Perhaps God will say, "You have lived less than ten years before Me." Or you may have lived fifty years, but God may say, "In My eyes you have only lived a few days." It would be a pity if all your days were wasted away.</p><h2 class="head1">SEVEN</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, my heart aches when I think of the days you have wasted in the past. But thank the Lord that He has given you comfort; you have the words of Joel 2:25. The years that the locusts have eaten will be restored to you. Thank God that He has a way. Perhaps you are sixty years old and have wasted thirty to forty years. You have to say, "Oh, my opportunity is gone. My best days have been eaten up by the locusts, and the lost days cannot be recovered again. What can I do?" Thank the Lord that He will restore the days that were eaten up by the locusts. If you waste your days, ten years may be equal to one day. But if you redeem the time, one day may equal ten years. David said, "For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand" (Psa. 84:10). The days in heaven are not counted by a twenty-four hour cycle. God has a different way of counting days. If our service is according to God's will, one day will equal many days.</p><p>There was once a young man who fell into sin and was about to die of tuberculosis. An old servant of God went to him and preached about Jesus taking away sins. He exhorted him to repent, confess his sins, and accept the Lord Jesus as his Savior. At first the young man thought it was a hard thing to do. He doubted whether a sinner such as he could be saved. But eventually, he accepted the Lord and was saved. He was filled with joy and peace. A few days later, the old servant of God went to see him again and noticed that he was full of sorrow and sadness again, and he asked, "Why are you this way? Do not allow the devil to deceive you!" He answered, "No, I know that my sins are forgiven." The old servant asked, "Why then are you still so sorrowful?" He answered sadly, "My days on earth are about over. When I stand before the Lord, what should I bring to Him? My hands are empty! How can I go to the Lord empty-handed?" He was sorrowful because of this. The old man said to him, "Brother, it is all right! Use the very words that you have just said as the subject and write a hymn about it. Perhaps some will be touched by this hymn and will go out to preach and to gain some others. The reward will then go to you." The hymn that he wrote is the famous one, "Must I Go, and Empty-handed," (Hymns, #930). Many have been touched by this hymn to become zealous for the Lord's work. Although this young person lost many of his years, he had a heart for the Lord at the close of his life, and the Lord fulfilled his wish.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, let us all number our days! May the days that we have lost be restored to us, and may each day of our life be worth a thousand. May we all walk step by step in the light of God's will!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">THE TESTIMONY OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 119:125</h1><h2 class="head1">GOD'S TESTIMONY BEING<br />AN EXPRESSION OF GOD HIMSELF</h2><p>We often talk about the testimony of God. What actually is the testimony of God, and what does it refer to? The word testimony is used in the Old Testament more often than it is used in the New Testament. We would like to point out two places in the Old Testament. In the Pentateuch, especially in Exodus, the word testimony is used quite frequently. (The word covenant in the phrases the ark of the covenant and the tablets of covenant is testimony in the original language.) The other place is in Psalm 119. The uses of the word testimony in Psalm 119 and in the Pentateuch open our eyes to see its meaning. Psalm 119 often speaks of the word of God, His laws, statutes, ordinances, and commandments. At the same time, it also frequently speaks of God's testimony, which is placed side by side with His word, ordinances, statutes, and commandments. We should keep God's word. We should keep His laws, ordinances, statutes, and commandments. Psalm 119 also shows that we should keep God's testimony. This expression sounds unfamiliar, and it is difficult to understand. But in God's Word and in His mind, His testimony is the same as His word; it is the same as His ordinances, laws, statutes, and commandments. A testimony is the same in nature as an ordinance, etc.</p><p>Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers not only show that God's testimony is equal to His word and ordinances, but that the two tablets of stone, upon which the laws were inscribed, were called the tablets of testimony. The two tablets were placed in the ark, and it was called the ark of the testimony. God inscribed the law on two tablets of stone and called them the tablets of testimony. He also called the ark the ark of the testimony.</p><p>This shows us what a testimony is. A testimony is a law. It is God's heart, demand, or standard. The two tablets of testimony in Exodus are a good picture; they were set before men to show them God's standard. What is God's standard? God's standard expresses God Himself; it shows the kind of God that He is. God's testimony is made for Himself; it manifests God's absolute standard.</p><p>When this testimony is manifested among men, it becomes the law. With God it is a testimony, and among men it is the law. It testifies to God's demand on His side, and it dictates to man what he should keep on his side. In God's hand it is the testimony, and in man's hand it is the law. In God's hand it is His demand, and in man's hand it is his duty. When it is put before man, it tells him what he ought to do; it also testifies of what man has done wrong and what the nature of God is. When this testimony is placed in man's hand, it testifies of his wrongdoings, showing how much he has come short of God's standard. When this testimony is in God's hand, it testifies of the kind of God that He is. A testimony is God opening His mouth to declare what He is in Himself.</p><p>In the New Testament, this thought is more obvious. The Lord Jesus came as a testimony to the Father, while the Holy Spirit came as a testimony to Christ. The church maintains the testimony of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit. To testify Christ means to tell others about who He is and what He is. This is a testimony. On God's side, the testimony is God Himself, and on man's side, the testimony is a tremendous matter&mdash;it is the law within man. We should not offend this testimony, and God will not lightly regard any offense to this testimony.</p><h2 class="head1">ONLY THOSE WHO KNOW GOD CAN TESTIFY FOR GOD</h2><p>A testimony is a tremendous matter. We must realize that the central meaning of testimony is God's declaration of Himself; it declares that God is a God of life. In order to testify of Himself, He came among men and declared what He is. This testimony is a spiritual fact; it is the ultimate reality. If anyone has not touched this ultimate reality, he has not touched the testimony. Strictly speaking, no one can testify of God, because from eternity to eternity, only God can testify of Himself; God Himself declares who He is. (The testifying that we are speaking of here is different from the testifying that we understand in ordinary terms.)</p><p>There is much that we can say about God; we can testify for God and speak of the kind of God that He is, but our words are useless. We can recite one, ten, or a hundred speeches concerning God, but we must realize that the testimony is not given by man; the testimony is what God tells us about Himself. Therefore, if God does not speak, there will be no testimony. Do you see the significance of this? If God does not speak, there will be no testimony. If God does not tell men about Himself, no one can testify for Him. We can talk and speak, but talking and speaking are useless because only we are talking and speaking. If God does not speak, everything is vain. For example, I may try to defend someone in court by witnessing for him, and I may be very eloquent. If the defendant, however, will not testify or say anything, what are my words worth? God's testimony is His declaration about Himself. If God does not speak, there is no testimony.</p><p>Therefore, anyone who testifies for God must touch God and speak what God wants to speak. A man will not have anything to speak for God until he has known God, seen God, and received revelation from God. When he touches the ultimate reality, he will have something to say, and he will be able to testify for God. If we have not touched this reality, we will have nothing to say, and we will have no testimony. We can convey God's commandments, statutes, and ordinances to others, and we can preach the word of the Bible. But these are not the testimony. The testimony is something else. Even though man can receive ordinances, statutes, and commandments, the testimony remains with God. These are outward things, but the testimony, the ultimate reality, remains with God. Consequently, Christ needed to come from God to testify for God. Similarly, only the Spirit which proceeds from Christ can testify for Christ, and only those who know this Christ and this Spirit can testify for God and Christ. This has nothing to do with what man can say; it is not a matter of his doctrines or his teachings. It is a matter of Christ being released. The testimony can become a doctrine, but a doctrine can never be the testimony. The testimony can make demands on man, but a demand can never be the testimony. The testimony is something entirely different; it is something absolutely different from what we ordinarily think of as a testimony. We often say that we cannot testify because we do not have the experience. But even if we have experiences and personal encounters, these things are small in the context of the testimony; they do not fit into the testimony. The testimony is not a matter of experiences and personal encounters, but a matter of touching the Lord. From man's point of view, a testimony is an experience, but terms such as experience and personal encounters are too small; they are not great enough and cannot be compared with the testimony. The testimony is man touching the Lord. Only God can testify for Himself, because no one is greater than God. Only God can testify for God.</p><p>The greatest problem in the church is that there are too many doctrines from man. Man comes up with many doctrines and biblical teachings; he tells others what they should do, what is scriptural, and what is unscriptural. Man pays attention to all these matters, but a genuine testimony touches the ultimate reality. Only that which touches God constitutes a testimony. I do not wish to say too much concerning this point, yet I would like all of us to ponder this matter before the Lord. Brothers and sisters, if we read the Pentateuch and Psalm 119 again, we will realize that God uses the term testimony differently than we do. A testimony is too great a thing; it is something that our mind cannot fathom. The testimony is the speaking of God concerning Himself and His demands. Those who have touched God's testimony surely have touched God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">OFFENDING GOD BEING TO OFFEND THE TESTIMONY</h2><p>What does it mean to offend the testimony? To offend the testimony is to offend God Himself. Anything that touches God's attributes and ways touches God's testimony. God intends to express His absolute attributes. Anything that improperly expresses them or improperly represents them is an offense to God's testimony. God is very unforgiving about some things, because they touch His testimony. Whenever something touches His testimony, He will not bear with it lightly. He is very uncompromising with anything that improperly expresses Him or that affects His attributes, position, or person.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ISRAELITES NOT BEING ABLE TO ENTER CANAAN</h2><p>There are a few sobering cases in the Old Testament. In Numbers 13 and 14, God did not allow the Israelites to enter Canaan. Before Kadesh-barnea, the Israelites committed many sins. They often tempted God and often offended Him, but God forgave them. However, after the incident at Kadesh-barnea, God decided that they could not enter Canaan. His decision was firm. Why? When they reached Kadesh-barnea, the Israelites had experienced many miracles already, and they had witnessed that Canaan was a land flowing with milk and honey. However, they believed that the people in the land were too strong and the cities too big. They thought that the sons of Anak were giants and that they themselves were but grasshoppers. They were afraid and wept, and they would not enter the land. Their fear and tears were an insult to God; it affected God Himself. When the Israelites cried and murmured for food and drink, it did not seem that serious. Some sins are caused by human weaknesses, and God is quite forbearing with them. For example, the Israelites craved their favorite food and spoke against God, saying, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?" (Psa. 78:19). This did not affect God's attributes, because He knew that they were lustful. He punished them a little and then let them go. However, the incident at Kadesh-barnea did not reflect upon human weaknesses but upon God's power. Being fearful, weeping, and refusing to enter the land were the same as saying that God had brought them to a place of death; it put a question mark on God Himself. When this happened, God could no longer be forbearing. In relation to His government, He could not forgive them. Those who arrived at Kadesh-barnea and refused to go in were not allowed to enter. This was the end; there was no further possibility of repentance. They asked to enter a second time, but God would not relent; He could not relent when His government was concerned. Once His decision was made, it was final. When He said that they could no longer enter, He was firm in the matter because they had offended God Himself. This is the meaning of offending God's testimony.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COMPANY OF KORAH</h2><p>In Numbers 16 and 17 we see the judgment on the company of Korah. They reviled Moses and Aaron, saying that they had gone too far and had exalted themselves above the congregation of Jehovah. God punished the company of Korah; the ground opened its mouth and swallowed them. The next day the congregation of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying that they had killed the people of God, and God's wrath fell upon them also. Later God told Moses to call the leaders of the twelve tribes together and put twelve rods in the tabernacle before the testimony (17:4). The one whose rod budded was the one chosen by God. We can see a great principle in this severe judgment. If men are just arguing about who is the greatest, God will still let them go. John and James argued about who was the greatest, but the ground did not open its mouth to swallow them up. Even at the last supper of the Lord, the disciples were still arguing about who was the greatest, and the ground did not open its mouth to swallow them up then. The consequence was much more serious in Numbers because they had offended God's testimony. The testimony says that only those in resurrection can serve God; dead ones cannot serve God. A man can only serve the Lord in resurrection. Today outside of resurrection, there is no life. In the garden of Eden, we see the tree of life. But today life is in resurrection because death came in. Today life is represented by resurrection. If a man has not entered resurrection, he cannot come before God. Today this life has passed through death. This is why it is called resurrection. Revelation 1:18 is excellent; it says, "And the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever." Today it is not just a matter of living but a matter of becoming dead and living again. Today our Lord is standing on the ground of resurrection. We also have to stand on the ground of resurrection. Anything that is not standing on the ground of resurrection cannot come before God. Only that which has passed through death and resurrection can stand before God. Many people have not brought their eloquence, thought, ability, power, and wisdom through death; these things are not on the ground of resurrection, and they cannot come before God. In Aaron we see a great testimony&mdash;only one who is in resurrection is qualified to serve God. The budding rod tells us that the only one who has a ministry is the one who is in resurrection. Without resurrection, no one can serve God. This is the testimony! This incident speaks of a principle&mdash;man can only come before God through resurrection. When man was first created, he could come before God freely. But since man fell, he can only come before God through resurrection, because all sinners are dead before God, and no one can come before Him without first going through resurrection. Resurrection is the unique requirement for service today. Of course, this resurrection does not mean the resurrection life that we have received. It refers to the work of the cross in us. The cross was a "taking away" for the Lord Jesus, and it is also a "taking away" for us. When men crucified the Lord Jesus, they cried, "Take Him away! Take Him away!" (John 19:15). Everyone cried to remove Him. The cross is a great removal; all the old creation has to go. If the old creation does not go and the rod does not bud, God's testimony cannot be maintained. In other words, God has only opened one door. Those who do not enter through this unique door are dead. The company of Korah suffered severe judgment because they offended God's testimony. God will allow you to get by with some matters, but He will not allow you to get by with matters that offend His testimony. We must realize that the fundamental reason that God disciplines is to maintain His own testimony. In other words, God does not want to be misunderstood by men. When many people sin, others will only say that the sinners are poor, but not that God is poor. But when a man does certain things, others will say that God is poor; these things affect God Himself. God will not allow you to get by with things that affect God Himself, because these things offend the testimony; they offend God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">MOSES NOT BEING ABLE TO ENTER CANAAN</h2><p>In Numbers 20, Moses smote the rock at Meribah, and God forbade him from entering Canaan. Although Moses later pleaded, "Let me please cross over" (Deut. 3:25), God would not answer his pleading. When God said that he could not enter Canaan, it meant that he could not enter it. We know it was wrong for Moses to lose his temper and smite the rock with his rod. But we do not realize the gravity of the mistake he committed. We think that Moses was a meek person and that he unfortunately lost his temper. We may have seen many gentle persons lose their temper, yet God did not deal with them severely. Why was God so severe toward Moses? Let us see what God said. He said to Moses and Aaron, "You did not...sanctify Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel" (Num. 20:12). What does it mean to not sanctify the Lord? It means that we have implicated the Lord. To sanctify God is to set Him apart, to express His distinctive character. This is to sanctify the Lord. Even if Moses lost his temper ten times, others would only say that Moses had a quick temper, and the consequence would not be great. But when Moses lost his temper this time, it affected God Himself. God said that by losing his temper this way, Moses had involved God. He did not sanctify God; he did not put God in His rightful place. The problem with Moses' temper was that he lost his temper on the one hand, and water came out of the smitten rock on the other hand. God's work was evident. This made it difficult to distinguish who was involved. Moses involved God, because the Israelites might have thought in their hearts, "Now we know that God is this kind of God. He is a God who loses His temper and reviles." God was implicated through Moses. If Moses lost his temper and men only saw his bad temper, the consequence would have been small, and God would not have needed to seriously deal with him. God paid attention to this incident because Moses performed a miracle on the one hand&mdash;water came out and God's power was manifested&mdash;and lost his temper on the other hand. The Israelites could not distinguish the difference. They might have said that God caused the water to flow out for their drink and that God also lost His temper and reviled them. Moses dragged God into this confusing picture and did not make a clear distinction. This offended the testimony. The consequence was serious; God could not let him off easily; He had to disqualify Moses from entering the land.</p><h2 class="head1">UZZAH BEING KILLED</h2><p>In considering the matter of offending the testimony, we cannot help but recall the hand of Uzzah. Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God to take hold of it, and he was smitten by God and died by the ark (2 Sam. 6:1-7). God did this to vindicate Himself. We have said in the past that Uzzah tried to take hold of the ark with hands of flesh, but this is still not clear enough; it does not convey the seriousness of the matter. We must see that the ark is the ark of testimony. Before David became king, the ark was captured. At that time there was no Uzzah to protect the ark, yet the ark was able to protect itself. The ark was among the heathens, and it was moved from one place to another. There was no Uzzah or even a single Israelite to protect the ark, yet the ark did not fall. It had never fallen, and man could do nothing about it. When David moved it back, it was among God's people. Did it need someone to take hold of it? Here we see the sin of Uzzah. When the ark was among enemies, it protected itself. When it was among God's people, did it need someone to protect it? God wanted the Levites to lift the ark, yet they put it on a cart drawn by oxen. If the ark fell, that would be God's concern. But the use of man's hand to aid His will damaged His testimony. This is why God would not let this matter go.</p><p>We have to learn the lesson of allowing God to do many things. Those who do not know God's will try to help God. But if we spend some time before the Lord to consider the end of many men in the past, we can identify a principle: no one is allowed to offend God's testimony. Whenever anything offends God's attributes, His authority, His way, His plan, or His testimony, His disciplining hand will quickly come. God cannot allow His testimony to be damaged. He will demonstrate that He is a God of holiness, a God of power, and a God of life. Therefore, we must stand before Him in fear and trembling and not be careless or foolish at all.</p><h2 class="head1">OFFENDING GOD'S TESTIMONY<br />BRINGING IN HIS DISCIPLINE</h2><p>God often disciplines His children for the purpose of vindicating Himself. God wants to let men, as well as the devil, know that He has no part in a certain matter, that it is something done by man himself. If man cannot maintain God's testimony, He has to step forward to maintain it. God will maintain His testimony, even if man cannot; He will maintain it by Himself. If a man does not maintain God's testimony, he will suffer God's discipline. There are many kinds of sins. Some sins are related to ourselves alone; God pays less attention to them. But if anything that is related to God offends Him, He will step forward and immediately discipline us. He has to immediately declare that He has nothing to do with the matter. Therefore, we have to be very careful before the Lord. It is wrong to commit any sin in general, but in particular, we should not commit the sin of offending the testimony. In general we have to ask God in fear and trembling to keep us from sin. In particular we have to ask Him to keep us from the sin of offending the testimony. We have to learn to know God and learn to not offend Him. Whenever God declares Himself as God, He will not compromise nor implicate Himself with man. Man can fail, but he can never offend God's testimony. We can look at the stories of many men in the Old Testament, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and David. They were chosen by God, and God delighted in them. Their histories also show failures and shortcomings. Yet God judged them only briefly, and then He dropped the matter. Have you ever wondered why God behaved in this way? This was because the wrong things they committed did not offend God's testimony. Whenever God's testimony is offended, the consequence is grave and terrible. This is not a distinction between the Old Testament and the New Testament. This is a distinction between offending the testimony and honoring the testimony. It is a tremendous thing, a terrible thing, to offend God's testimony; God will not allow us to get by. We must learn to fear God in this matter.</p><p>Hebrews 12:10 says, "For they disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them; but He, for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness." God disciplines us for our profit, which is our participation in His holiness. God wants us to partake of His holiness. Whenever God disciplines, He disciplines for the purpose of vindicating Himself.</p><p>Have you ever realized that Satan's mouth is stopped whenever God disciplines us? Once God disciplines us, Satan has nothing more to say; he cannot accuse us any longer. The discipline from God is for the purpose of maintaining Himself; it maintains His own holiness. As a consequence, the enemy sees that God has no part in a certain matter. When you are under discipline, the first thing you should pray for is God's vindication, not your deliverance from the discipline. Whenever you are disciplined, you have to tell the brothers and sisters that you were disciplined because you offended God in a certain matter. It may be a simple word, but it will testify to the fact that God has no share in the matter. Some brothers and sisters have clearly done something wrong and experienced God's discipline, yet they continue to cry because the discipline is too severe and because they are in trouble. Yet they should not cry about this. God's discipline is for the purpose of absolving Himself in a matter; it is for the purpose of vindicating His name. His name is upon you, and if you are not careful, you will implicate Him. Therefore, He has to vindicate Himself. When you are disciplined, you should bow down and worship the Lord, saying, "I will gladly accept this discipline. I will gladly stand in this position. I will gladly let the devil, the church, and the world know that God has no share in this matter and that the wrong is all on my part." The more you submit to His disciplining hand and the more you vindicate God, the easier it will be for you to go through the discipline. But the more you try to run from the discipline and the more you struggle, the more you will not get away.</p><p>This matter has a great deal to do with God's way. We have to learn to know God in this matter. This will deliver us from many cumbersome things. At the same time, we must allow God to be glorified through our failures. If we do well and glorify God, we should thank God's grace for it. If we do not do well, we should still glorify God in the things which He uses to vindicate Himself. May the blood cover us in saying these words and may the blood cover all those who read these words. This is a sober matter, and we should pay much attention to it.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE TESTIMONY OF THE LORD JESUS<br />BEFORE THE HIGH PRIEST<br />AND PONTIUS PILATE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:57-66; 27:1-2, 11, 18; John 18:28-40; 19:7-8, 12, 15</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>On the night the Lord Jesus was betrayed, He was seized and taken to Caiaphas the high priest. Although the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin sought false testimony against Him and sought to put Him to death, they could find nothing to use against Him. Some false witnesses came forward to testify against Him, but their testimonies did not match; in the end, the chief priests and the Sanhedrin found nothing. The interesting thing is that under these circumstances, when so many people asked the Lord Jesus questions and brought false witness against Him, He did not answer at all. But when the high priest asked, "I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God," He answered, "You have said rightly." Then the high priest condemned Him based on this word. In the morning, they bound up the Lord and delivered Him to Pilate the governor. When Pilate asked, "Are You the King of the Jews?", He answered, "It is as you say." It is strange that after His response Pilate declared that He had no sin and was about to release Him. When He answered the high priest by saying, "You have said rightly," He was condemned, but when He answered Pilate by saying, "It is as you say," He was declared to be without guilt. The two reactions were exactly opposite. Before Caiaphas the high priest, the Lord's interrogation concerned the matter of being the Son of God, not of being King. Before Pilate the governor, the Lord's interrogation concerned the matter of being King. Outwardly, there is a big difference between these two matters, but in the eyes of God, they are linked together. In God's eyes the Jews did not have a king, and the Son of God came to be their King. Therefore, the Lord Jesus did not answer any other questions during the course of His trial other than the two which concerned His person and His work.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>We would like to turn our attention to the matter of the Lord's testimony. Before Caiaphas the high priest, the Lord acknowledged that He was the Son of God; He was testifying for Himself. Before Pilate, the Lord acknowledged that He was the King; He was also testifying for Himself. When the high priest heard the Lord's testimony about being the Son of God and that He would be "sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven," he tore his garments and said, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" They answered and said, "He is worthy of death." Why did they refuse the testimony of the Lord Jesus? What was their intention? They were not trying to prove whether or not He was the Son of God. To them it would prove that He had sinned if He said that He was the Son of God. They had no intention of determining whether He spoke the truth; their goal was to find an excuse for condemnation. Therefore, when the Lord Jesus acknowledged that He was the Son of God, they immediately condemned Him by saying that He had blasphemed. They were not interested in knowing whether this man was indeed the Son of God. Their only interest was in getting Him to say some words that could be used as an excuse for killing Him. They were the prominent ones among the Jews, yet they were not concerned about the things of God. Their only concern was that this Jesus, who called Himself the Son of God, was threatening their position by what He did and said. If they allowed Jesus to go on, their position would be in jeopardy, and their dignity would be bankrupted. Therefore, they hastily tried to remove Jesus so that they could maintain their personal prestige. They twisted the Lord's word, saying, "This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and build it up in three days." (Actually, the Lord Jesus did not say this. See John 2:19-21.) They said this to show their concern for the temple. But by that time the temple had become a den of robbers; they were not concerned about it. When the Lord Jesus came to cleanse the temple, they even tried to kill Him (Mark 11:17-18). They only cared for the outward appearance of the temple, and they were using it as a means to add to their base gain. They did not want the reality of the temple, and they feared that it would expose their sins. They kept the form of religion but denied the truth; they even tried to do away with the truth. Therefore, when the Son of God came to the world and declared that He was the Son of God, they regarded it as a sin. They thought that no one should say this even if it was true. The Lord Jesus was condemned by the high priest because He testified that He was the Son of God, not because He was the Son of God. They thought that this statement should never be made. They thought that the truth should never be testified. They tried everything they could to overturn this testimony. Finally, they appealed to the political power of Rome to kill the Lord Jesus.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>In the morning, they brought the Lord Jesus before Pilate the governor, and Pilate asked the Lord, "You are the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Are you saying this of yourself, or did others tell you about Me?" Pilate said, "Am I a Jew? Your nation and its chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?" Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling so that I would not be delivered to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not from here." Pilate then said, "So then You are a king?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears My voice." Pilate then asked, "What is truth?" After Pilate said this, he did not wait for Jesus' answer but went out to the Jews and told them, "I find no fault in Him." This was the Lord Jesus' testimony before Pilate.</p><p>Many people think that the question of being the King of the Jews referred to the Lord becoming the King of the Jews then. They think that it was a political question. But the Bible shows that when Pilate asked the question, "Are You the King of the Jews?", the Lord Jesus responded by asking him about the source of his question. This is the same as saying, "You have asked a question, but how much do you know about it? What is your understanding concerning it? Does your question represent your own view, or is it just hearsay?" This is very important. The Lord Jesus did not hide from Pilate the fact that He was the King of the Jews. He testified that He was the King of the Jews. But His testimony was different from the accusation of His plotters. A king is always related to a kingdom. Therefore, He said, "My kingdom is not of this world." Since His kingdom is not of this world, His attendants did not need to fight for Him. If His kingdom had been of this world, there would have been a need for war. His kingdom was from God and from above. Therefore, there was no need to fight. Warfare in the flesh was unnecessary. He was the King of the Jews and a King out of the Jews. It had nothing to do with world politics.</p><p>Among God's children, some only know the material world. They think that not being worldly means being unattached to material things. I am not saying that we should be excessive with material things. But the greatest matter relates to the source. The word "of" is fundamental. "My kingdom is not of this world." In other words, it is not from this world and does not belong to this world.</p><p>Among God's children, there are many things which seem spiritual. But if we trace their source, it is still the world. Although many terms are biblical, when we trace the source of their manifestation, it is the world. For example, we often say that humility is a virtue, and we admit that humility is something from the Bible. Yet the humility the Bible speaks of and the humility we have are not the same; this is where the problem lies. When we trace the source of our humility, we often find that we are humble because we are trying to avoid certain things. We are humble because we do not want to hurt others' feelings or invite others' criticisms. This humility comes from diplomacy. A humility that issues from diplomacy can be considered only as a superficial virtue. But when we trace its source, we cannot say, "My kingdom is not of this world." This kind of humility is of the world; it comes from a fear which is of the world. Brothers and sisters, if a Christian lives according to God, he can be gentle and strong at the same time because he does not have any worldly considerations and fears.</p><p>God's children often talk about being heavenly. But what does it mean to be heavenly? Those who are always in contact with heavenly things are not necessarily heavenly. Only that which comes from heaven is heavenly. In the same way, what does it mean to be worldly? It does not mean that a person who is in constant contact with the world is worldly. Being worldly means to come from the world. It does not mean that a person will not be worldly just by avoiding contact with the world and its things and affairs. Can you not be of this world simply by escaping from reality and changing your lifestyle? No, this is not the meaning of being not of this world. We are fundamentally of this world. This is why we need God's light. When God's light shines in us, we will realize that much of our goodness has its source and rationale in the world. We do certain things because of certain reasons, and these reasons are of the world. All of our virtues are apparently spiritual, but actually this "spirituality" is of the world. They do not constitute a testimony, and there is no spiritual reality behind them.</p><p>The Lord Jesus says, "My kingdom is not of this world." He is reigning in a realm that is not of this world. His kingdom is entirely different from the kingdom of this world. Hence, the question is not whether or not we have left the world but how many things in us are of the world. May the Lord be gracious to us and help us to not come under the influence of the world in spiritual matters.</p><p>When the Lord Jesus came to the earth, He came to testify for the truth. The hypocritical ones did not prefer light; instead, they preferred darkness because they did evil works; they wanted to do away with the Lord Jesus. But the Lord did not bow to the evil powers. When men reviled and accused Him, He did not answer, but when they came to the question of His person and His work, He made a good confession for the truth. The Lord traveled an uncommon pathway while He was on earth. In man's eyes He gained nothing, but He is now sitting at the right hand of Power, and He will come on the clouds of heaven. Praise the Lord! All those who follow Him should pay attention to His testimony!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:2</h1><p>The book of Revelation speaks of "the testimony of Jesus" several times. The apostle John was exiled to the island of Patmos for "the testimony of Jesus" (1:9). The saints of old were slain because of "the testimony" (6:9). The kind of people Satan attacks the most are those who "have the testimony of Jesus" (12:17). When the Lord Jesus comes back again, those who will reign with Him are the saints who have maintained "the testimony of Jesus." The angel said to John that "the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy" (19:10). Paul said in his Epistles that "the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you" (1 Cor. 1:6). What is the testimony of Jesus?</p><p>It would require a considerable amount of work to answer this question fully. We can only explain it in a brief and concise way here. The testimony of Jesus includes four aspects: (1) who He was and who He is, (2) His relationship with man, (3) His accomplishments on the cross, and (4) His relationship with God's eternal plan. These four aspects include everything about the testimony of Jesus. Many things are included in these four points, and we can only cover them briefly.</p><p>First, who was Jesus, and who is Jesus now? This has everything to do with Himself; it relates to the person of Christ. We must realize that the person of Christ occupies a very important place in theology. Do not think that theology is merely an exercise in fine technicalities. The deepest, craftiest, and most penetrating deceptions of Satan are directed against the person of Christ. Satan has many ways to lead men into some type of esoteric or philosophical interpretation of the person of Christ. Once he stumbles a devout believer with this question, he will destroy the ministry of that person for his entire life. We should always bear in mind that the devil will use any means to subtly set traps to stumble and ensnare God's children with doubts about Christ's person. The more we follow the Lord, the more Satan will try to ensnare us and create doubts in us about this matter. Satan knows that the minute he strikes this matter, he has struck the center of all matters. As long as he can put doubts and questions about the person of Christ within us, we are finished in the eyes of God. As long as there is a little doubt or error in our teaching about the person of Christ, we are finished in God's hand. Satan is intent on attacking those who have a heart to consecrate themselves to the Lord; he wants to distract them from the orthodox way of the truth concerning the person of Christ. We have to discern clearly the different so-called theological thoughts and must not be deceived or follow blindly to the extent that we fall into Satan's snare.</p><p>Who is Jesus? This is the foundation of our testimony. All false teachings and heretical doctrines directly or indirectly take this central question as their target of attack. They all try to tear down the person of Christ. Many people try to explain Christ in a roundabout way. In the end they do not acknowledge that Christ is God and do not want others to acknowledge that Christ is God. The first point concerning the testimony of Jesus Christ is the person of Christ.</p><p>What is Jesus' relationship with man? One term explains and expounds His relationship with man: representation. He did things that were absolutely superhuman, things that no man could ever do. This is because He is God, and He acts as God. Yet at the same time, everything He did represented man. He was joined to man, and He became flesh. He is the "mystery of godliness" (1 Tim. 3:16). He has physical organs and limbs like we do; He is man among men. Hence, He is a representation of man. His human living on earth, His work, His death, His burial, His resurrection, His ascension, and His position and work in heaven today are all representative in nature. The testimony of Jesus includes His relationship with man. It speaks of His representation then and now.</p><p>What did Jesus accomplish on the cross? He accomplished death, burial, resurrection, and kingship. This is universal and all-inclusive&mdash;involving His all-inclusive death, all-inclusive burial, all-inclusive resurrection, and all-inclusive kingship, reign, and subjection of all things. This is the testimony of Jesus.</p><p>What is Jesus' relationship with God's eternal plan? God ordained in eternity past that the Lord Jesus be Head over all things. He is the King of kings. This is the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p><p>We believe the above four points are the testimony of Jesus; they include the whole scope of the Bible. You can trace a line from the Old Testament to the New Testament, from Genesis to Revelation, concerning these things. Today this testimony is contained within a vessel. This vessel is the church, His Body. This testimony is contained within this vessel and is manifested in two ways: (1) It is the sum total of all the truths that are revealed, and (2) it becomes the power of the truths that are constituted in this vessel. It is true that the testimony of Jesus is contained within this vessel; this truth was created in Jesus through the Spirit. Hence, it is not merely an objective truth that can be understood by the mind. This truth has to become our life, our nature, and part of our experience through the Holy Spirit. The testimony is found in the vessel, and the vessel is the church, His Body, of which we are the members. The Holy Spirit is revealing this testimony and constituting it into the church.</p><p>Has the Holy Spirit revealed the Lord Jesus to you? You must not confess that Jesus is the Son of God simply because you agree with others who say that He is the Son of God. You must believe that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God because of the revelation of the Holy Spirit. This is something that comes from the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Do we see the representative work of the Lord Jesus through the Holy Spirit? Is the vision continually clear that Christ was and still is our Representative? Has our vision become part of our life? All these matters need to be examined carefully. The Lord Jesus is our Representative at the right hand of God. The Lord Jesus represents us in His moral and spiritual perfection to meet all of God's demands. Before God, we are perfect in Him (Col. 1:28). Within the man Jesus, God has found human perfection. God reckons His perfection as our own. He no longer needs to find another perfect man; He has gained One already. Now God is sharing Christ's perfection with us. This is the work of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit dispenses the Lord Jesus to us through our faith and obedience. Has this become a part of us yet? This requires the revealing and constituting work of the Spirit. It is not a theory, concept, or creed. When we truly see it, we will know the difference between the two. This is why we say that we need the revelation and constitution of the Spirit.</p><p>We need the Holy Spirit to reveal what the Lord Jesus has done on the cross before His work can become a part of us. The Lord Jesus not only died for us; He died as us. When He died, we died also. When He was buried, we were buried also. When He resurrected, we appeared in Him also. Has the Holy Spirit shown us these things, and do we know them? With resurrection as our position and foundation, judgment is over. There is now no more condemnation, and we are no longer condemned. This may be only in the Bible, or it may truly be a part of our life as a revelation in us. This is what it means to have the testimony of Jesus contained in the vessel, which is the church, the Body of Christ, of which we are the members. We are called to testify of the truth that is contained in this vessel so that the testimony of the truth will be constituted in us through revelation. Hence, we must "earnestly contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints. For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who of old have been written of beforehand for this judgment, ungodly men, perverting the grace of our God into licentiousness and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ" (Jude 3-4).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN<br />GOD HAS SHOWN ON THE MOUNT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 8:5; Psa. 19:13</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>The most important thing in our spiritual work is a knowledge of the "pattern on the mount." In our spiritual work, many things are important, and if we come short in any of them, our work will lose its spiritual usefulness and not please God. Of these important items, the most crucial one is "the pattern on the mount." The pattern on the mount is God's plan. If we do not understand God's plan, it will be impossible for us to do God's work.</p><p>The book of Hebrews tells us that the tabernacle was made according to God's revealed pattern. Before Moses built the tabernacle, he remained on the mountain forty days and nights, in order to give God time to show him the pattern and method of construction for the heavenly tabernacle. There were prescribed patterns for everything from the Holy Place to the altar, including the material and color of each layer of the tabernacle's covering. Nothing was left to random design; there were prescribed plans and standards for everything. The altar, laver, table, lampstand, incense altar, ark, and everything else were made according to God's prescribed pattern, which even specified the kind of metal or wood to be used and their measurements and colors. Nothing was left to Moses' design.</p><p>God's building of the church is the same as His building of the tabernacle; He works according to a prescribed plan. No matter how great or how small a matter is, God has an ordained way. Moses was not responsible for the design of the pattern of the tabernacle; he was only responsible for carrying out the pattern according to instructions he received on the mount. The glory of a servant of Christ does not lie in his ability to come up with new designs for God but in his faithfulness in carrying out the will of God as he understands it. Understanding God's plan and working according to His plan are the glory of a servant of Christ.</p><p>A sister who has been serving the Lord for many years once said that man does not have any liberty at all in the work of God. When Moses built the tabernacle, he did not have the liberty to determine whether gold or silver should be used for even the smallest nail; everything had to be done according to God's instruction.</p><p>Moses was a meek person (Num. 12:3). What does it mean to be meek? It means to be pliable and yielding. He did what God wanted him to do. God prescribed the materials, colors, designs, and measurements, and Moses carried out the work according to God's instruction. He did everything according to God's command and did nothing according to his own will. This was Moses' meekness.</p><p>Moses' building of the tabernacle gives us much spiritual light. It shows us the proper standing of a servant of God in spiritual work. God prescribed everything concerning the tabernacle; He did not leave one single feature or small detail for Moses to design. God did not allow Moses to propose anything. He told Moses not only the general features of the tabernacle but the details as well. Not only were the patterns, materials, colors, and measurements of every item determined by God, but even the way they were to be made was determined by God. It was not enough for Moses to make them according to God's prescribed measurements and pattern; he even had to make them according to God's prescribed procedure. For example, the veils had to be made not only of fine linen but of fine linen that was twined. The lampstand had to be made not only of gold but of one piece of gold of beaten work. God did not leave any room for Moses to make any proposals. He knew what He wanted. He did not need man to be His counselor, and He would not allow His servants to follow their own ideas in carrying out His work.</p><p>The greatest blessing a servant of Christ can possibly have is to receive God's instruction on the mount, to know the kind of work God has assigned for him, and to know the prescribed pattern concerning the work. Servants of Christ, are you coming to God to ask for your assigned work? Are you coming to God for His instruction as to the time and method of your work? Or are you conducting your work according to human reasonings, plans, schemes, and decisions? Many people think that God has no detailed prescriptions concerning His work and that many things are left to their own design. They have not seen that they are but a servant in God's work, and they can only do as they are told. They forget the words: "Whatever He says to you, do" (John 2:5). They forget that they are but a member in the Body of Christ and that they have to hold the Head (Col. 2:19) and be under the direct control of the Head. They presume that God needs their fleshly life and natural strength to fill up the lack of His plan. May God show us that Christ is the absolute Master in God's work. Everything related to God's work must first pass His authorization. The power of Christ's servants and the fruitfulness in their spiritual service can only be secured and manifested through singleness in pursuit of God's will and adherence to His plan. Otherwise, a worker's work may appear exciting, and the outward accomplishments may be great, but before the judgment seat of the Lord, all of these works will be shown by the trying fire to be nothing but wood, grass, and stubble.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Psalm 19:13 says, "Keep Your servant from presumptuous sins;/Do not let them have dominion over me;/Then I will be blameless and cleared/Of great transgression." This tells us that God's servants have two kinds of sins before Him. One is the sin of rebellion, and the other is the sin of presumptuousness. If you do not do what God wants you to do, this is the sin of rebellion. We all know that this is a sin, and we are all willing to remove this sin. None of us wants to commit this sin. But brothers and sisters, please remember that not only is rebellion a sin; presumptuousness is also a sin. If we do what God has not commanded us to do, we are committing the sin of presumptuousness. Rebellion is to refuse to do what God commands us to do, whereas presumptuousness is to do what God has not commanded us to do. Any activity outside of God is presumption. God says that one should not commit fornication or steal. If a man transgresses in any of these things, he has sinned. This is something we know. But we also think that we can do what God has not commanded us to do. We do not realize that this is sin also. If God has not commanded you to do something, yet you do it according to your own will, you have committed a sin before God even though you may think that you have done a most wonderful work. David's prayer was excellent; he prayed that God would keep him from the sin of presumptuousness.</p><p>God knows what He wants, and He reveals what He wants  through the Bible or through the Spirit. Spiritual work is not a matter of quantity but a matter of being according to God's use and will. The most important thing for a servant of Christ is to know what God wants from him. A characteristic of the new covenant is that man can know God's will. A servant of Christ can receive the revelation of the Holy Spirit within himself; he can know clearly God's requirement. This kind of knowledge is real; it does not come from one's imagination or from others' persuasion or instruction. This kind of knowledge cannot be learned from the letter of the Bible. These commandments from God are revealed by the Holy Spirit to a person's spirit, in the deepest part of his being.</p><p>How many today truly understand spiritual revelation? How many can truly say, "I have seen it"? Many people have replaced God's own work with things they consider to be good and spiritual, things that they zealously pursue after, and things that they consider to be beneficial. There are more volunteers in God's work than called ones. Many people can only say, "I have come"; they cannot say, "I am sent." This is why many of the so-called works of God are filled with deadness. Many works are not approved by God; they are merely the result of man's zeal for God. Man does them because he thinks that God needs them, and he calls them the works of God. Actually, in this kind of work the element of God is almost nonexistent; there is almost nothing that is from God.</p><p>Genuine spiritual work is not initiated by us, but by God. Our only responsibility is to discern God's will. Any work that has any genuine spiritual value finds its source in the heart of God; we work only when the Holy Spirit puts a revelation in us and gives us the understanding of His will. In spite of the vast differences in outward appearance and results, there are only two kinds of service to God&mdash;that which has its source in God and that which has its source in man. One is what God wants, and the other is what man thinks God wants. Dear brothers and sisters, what kind of work are you doing?</p><p>It is unfortunate that many servants of Christ do not pay attention to the sin of presumptuousness, or shall we say, are not thoroughly clear about the nature of presumptuous sins. They have not allowed the Holy Spirit to bring them to the point where they deeply judge themselves. They have not yet realized that God is the only Master and that there is no place for them to propose anything. We need the conviction of the Holy Spirit to show us the sin of presumptuousness and God's hatred toward such sin. We should realize that it is a sin for us to not do what He has commanded, and equally a sin for us to do what He has not commanded. We should not say, "Since God has not stopped me, why can't I do it?" Rather, we should say, "How can I possibly do what God has not commanded me to do?" Those who do not know the Lord deeply will think that they can do what the Bible has not forbidden them to do. But those who know the Lord deeply realize that even though the Bible does not forbid them to do many things, they are committing a presumptuous sin if they do anything without God's explicit command. Brothers and sisters, God will bring us to a deeper place one day, and we will realize that it is not enough to refrain from rebellion against God; it is not enough to refrain from doing what He forbids us to do. We also have to refrain from doing what He has not commanded us to do. If we can stop our self-will from doing what God has not commanded, we will be perfected, and God can use us. A perfect man is one who will not work when he has not received God's command; he is one who does not commit the sin of presumptuousness. If God has not told us to do anything, we should stand still and not move. God can use only this kind of people; only this kind of person can work for God.</p><p>In God's work we see many people working according to their self-will. If a man does not care for God's will, God's timing, and God's method, even the best work will be just the zealous activity of the soulish life. We must realize that the flesh not only opposes God, but it also tries to help God. Our soulish (fleshly) life may have much natural merit. The soulish life can become zealous for God, thinking of this and that way to revive the church of God, coming up with this and that way to increase the kingdom of God, or laboring this and that way to save many sinners. Soulish believers have good intentions and motives, but they do not realize that the fleshly life is bringing about all their zeal, planning, design, and labor. They do not realize that only what God has commanded is worthwhile. They think that nothing can be better than engaging oneself in the work of God. They do not know that the fleshly life, even if it comes with good motives, wonderful goals, or laudable results, is not pleasing to the Lord, because it is not according to God's will and not suitable for His use. They also do not realize that God will not lend His strength to any work that is not done according to His will. They think that the zeal, noise, emotion, energy, and tears of their work are being supplemented by God's power. Little do they realize that they are drawing from the power of their natural life to supply a work that issues from their natural life.</p><p>What is the reason for such presumptuousness? It is nothing other than a desire for the expression of the self-life. Many people obey God's command when they know of it, yet in their heart, they do not have a desire for His will; they still prefer their own will. Therefore, when God is silent and does not speak, they become presumptuous. Brothers and sisters, if we do not judge the flesh and take up our cross to deal with the self-life, we may obey reluctantly when God's command comes, but when we have no command from Him, we will act according to our own will.</p><p>In God's work, those who are presumptuous do not necessarily have a bad motive. Before we turned to God, our self-life did not have any desire to serve God. But after we turned to Him, we began to have a desire to serve Him. This is the most dangerous period. In the past we had absolutely no desire to serve God, but now we want to serve Him. However, we want to serve according to our own way. But God demands that we not only serve Him but also serve Him according to the way He approves. Man frequently makes the mistake of thinking that God only wants our service and that we can choose the way to serve Him. We have to realize that God does not approve of any service that is not done according to His direction. Therefore, not only must our work be ordained by God, but also the method, timing, and procedure of the work must be determined by Him.</p><p>No matter how good man's motives are, these motives cannot replace God's will. No matter how successful man's work is, no success can replace God's approval. Too many works are done solely for "meeting the needs of the circumstances," for "edifying the spiritual life of the believers," or for "saving sinners' souls"; they are not done out of obedience to God's will. We cannot say for sure that these works have not produced any result. But these works and these workers are of no use in the sight of the Lord. Our primary concern should not be the outward needs of the sinners and believers but God's need of the hour. Our work should first meet God's needs, not the needs of the sinners or the saints. We are God's servants, and although He has entrusted the responsibility of the work to us, He reserves the authority to direct the work for Himself. Although the Holy Spirit summoned God's servants to their work, Paul and Barnabas could not go to Asia according to their self-will. The matter depended on whether or not God had a need at that time in Asia. The Acts of the Apostles wonderfully shows that the One who gives the power for work and the One who dictates the direction of the work is the Spirit. The responsibility in our work is to meet God's need in this hour.</p><p>The Bible shows us that we are not hired but bought by God with the blood. God has the absolute, sovereign right over us. Therefore, we cannot do anything according to our own will. God has not entrusted things to us so that we can make proposals according to our own view. He does not do things this way. God has specific instructions for us concerning every work of His. If we act presumptuously without waiting for His command, we will not be approved, and He will not use us. Our work will not stand the fire and will be burned.</p><p>The Bible shows us that God wants to manifest His work not only in big things but also in small things. Therefore, we have to allow Him to have preeminence in all things. We must acknowledge God not only as the Lord of big things but also as the Lord of small things. He is through all and in all. If our work is not according to His will, we may win man's praise, but God will not be able to use us.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>The Bible has many examples to illustrate this point. Leviticus 10:1-2 says, "Now the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, each took his censer and put fire in it, and placed incense upon it, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them. And fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, and they died before Jehovah." The law concerning the offering required that every time one burned the incense, the fire had to come from the altar. The failure of Nadab and Abihu lay in their failure to use the fire from the altar. They used a different fire for the incense, and the result was death before Jehovah.</p><p>The altar is a type of the cross, whereas the incense is a type of our service before God. The zeal of our service must come from the altar of the cross. Those who do not offer according to this rule will die. What is the cross? It is the place where the self is put to death and the place where we allow the Lord to live. It is the experience of Galatians 2:20, which says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." The cross deals with the self's wisdom, opinion, energy, zeal, hope, and desire. After we have been dealt with in this way, we are qualified to serve before the Lord.</p><p>The zeal of many is but strange fire! Men often do not go through the dealing of the cross; they do not reject their own will and wisdom, and they act according to their flesh. Yet they think that by so doing, they can please God and revive the Lord's work. This is zeal to be sure, but it is not zeal that comes from God. It is fire to be sure; however, it is not fire from the altar but strange fire. Anything that is not from the altar of the cross of self-denial is strange fire. Strange fire is fire of the self; it is fire that issues from the soulish life, the fleshly life, and the natural life. Strange fire means that the self-life interferes with the works of God. Although the works are God's, the self-life wants to dictate the way the works are carried out. Offering up strange fire is employing the self's methods and wisdom and insisting on the self's proposals in the works of God. Strange fire will not win us God's acceptance in the incense of our service but will cause us to die before the Lord.</p><p>Nadab and Abihu were two sons of Aaron. Aaron was the high priest chosen by God. What the two men did was not rebellion against God; they burned incense to serve God and please Him. Yet they did what God had not commanded them to do. They did not act according to God's command and were judged by Him. Aaron's sons might have thought that since God had not explicitly forbidden them to use other kinds of fire for the incense, they could use strange fire. They did not realize that in God's service, anything that He has not explicitly commanded us to do should not be done at all. They did not see how strict our God is. In God's work, anything that He has not commanded is forbidden by Him, and if man does any of these things, he errs and has sinned. God sent fire to Nadab and Abihu and burned them to death because they committed the sin of presumptuousness. Although they were the sons of Aaron and were priests rendering service to God, God did not tolerate their actions.</p><p>They did not commit any treachery, fraud, fornication, or robbery like the sons of Eli. They did not rebel against any of God's explicit commandments and did not do anything that God forbids men to do. They were there specifically to serve God and please Him. They purposefully prepared two censers and burned incense with their own fire. They thought that they would please God. Little did they realize that even though their motive was good, they were serving the Lord according to their own will. They did what God had not commanded them to do; they did something outside God's will. This offended God. In all of our service to God, we cannot presume that God will approve our work just because we have a good motive. Our motive may be good, but if we are presumptuous, God will still punish our sin of presumptuousness. Today we may not see God's severe judgment immediately upon our work, but we must realize that all the work that comes from strange fire will be judged at the judgment seat on that day. May the Lord open our eyes to see what sin is. Not only are fornication, robbery, deceit, extortion, unrighteousness, and filthiness sins, but even "working for God," "preaching," and "helping others" can be sins if we are not doing them according to God's direction. God will judge the sin of presumptuousness also. All those who work by themselves without God's command are offering a service of strange fire and offending God.</p><p>First Samuel 13:8-14 records the story of Saul offering the burnt offering by himself. It serves as a big warning to us. Saul had three great reasons for offering the sacrifice by himself. First, he saw that the people were leaving him. Second, Samuel had not come at the appointed time. Third, his enemy, the Philistines, had gathered in Michmash and were going to come down to Gilgal to attack them. Therefore, he "forced" himself and offered a burnt offering (v. 12). Saul did not do anything evil; he was offering a sacrifice to Jehovah. He thought in his heart that God might not be pleased if he did not pray and that God would be pleased if he prayed more. He thought that he would save the people from the enemy's hand by rendering a little more service to Jehovah. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Samuel said to Saul, "Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee" (vv. 13-14).</p><p>Saul said, "Therefore said I" (v. 12). That was not a command from the Lord. Brothers and sisters, God wants us to serve Him according to His instruction; He does not want us to serve according to what we think or presume. Every work that originates from our thinking and presumption is rejected by God. God is after those who are after His heart. God's heart is not on what we do but on our obedience. "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (15:22). This is something that every servant of the Lord should remember.</p><p>Many times we are like Saul; we cannot wait to engage ourselves in many works. We find it hard to believe that God is ever late, and we cannot wait for His timing. We only see our needs and the needs of the environment, and we forget to wait on God's timing. As a result we do what God has not commanded us to do.</p><p>Saul was rejected by God for his over-zealousness and his over-eagerness to offer sacrifices and to pray. He had many reasons for doing this, but God found a man after His own heart, whom He could appoint to be the ruler of the people. The man God is after is not one who is impatient; he is one who is after His heart. If we were there, we would surely have loved a man like Saul because he was an outstanding person. When Saul stood among the people, he was a head taller than the others. But God is not after outstanding persons; He is after those who are after His heart. May the goal of our service not be a great work or our own or others' approval but the heart of God and His acceptance. God can only use such people, and He is looking for such people.</p><p>Read 2 Samuel 6:1-7: "Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubim. And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark....And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God." When they read this portion, many people ask why God did this. Uzzah stretched out his hand to uphold the ark of God. He should have been rewarded. Why did God immediately  kill him instead? God's glory was with the ark. Was it not a good thing for Uzzah to uphold the ark? Why did God smite him instead? The only reason is that God cares for obedience to His will more than help in His work. God does not need anyone to uphold His glory. Whoever touches the ark is smitten by the Lord. The issue here is not the consequence of the ark falling down. The issue here is whether or not God has commanded a person to do something. Man thinks that the ark should not be touched at ordinary times but that it is all right to touch it and keep it from falling when it is in peril. He thinks that he will not be punished by death, because this is a provisional move. But with God there are only eternal edicts; there is no such thing as provisional measures. If a man does what God has not commanded him to do, he dies either physically or spiritually.</p><p>God did not ask whether the work was good or bad. He did not ask for help; rather, He said that man's hand should not touch the ark and that whoever touched it would die. God would rather see His ark fall than have men help Him without His command. Many times when we see outward needs, we try to help God. How terrible it is when God's servants try to do what Uzzah did; they try to help God's work with a fleshly hand. The result is God's judgment! Brothers and sisters, we must remember that we should only pay attention to God's command. Those who make provisional moves because of circumstantial needs and who do not wait on God's command will never please God in His work. We can allow our work to temporarily (and superficially) fail, but God's sovereign right cannot be set aside, and man's flesh cannot be left unchecked. He has no need for man to uphold His work with the flesh. His intention is to judge all fleshly activities.</p><p>Some people try to do what God has not told them to do. They try to please God according to their own will. They strive to do what God has not commanded them to do and do not realize that they are not pleasing God but rather are inviting His condemnation. When we were sinners, we walked according to our own wisdom and did many things contrary to God's nature. Now that we are saved, we still think that we can exercise our own wisdom to serve God and help Him according to what we think is right. Little do we realize that when we were sinners, it was a sin for us to oppose God with our own wisdom, and now that we are saved, it is equally a sin to help God in His work with our own wisdom. God does not need us to help Him with our own wisdom. God does not like to see man opposing Him with his own wisdom, and He does not like to see man helping Him with his own wisdom either. God does not need man to help His work. We must accept the principle of the cross and deny the activities of the self-life. We must be willing to put our flesh to death and lose our own will. Whenever we act according to our own will and think that by so doing we will revive God's work, it shows that we have not denied the self and do not know the cross. A man must be brought to a "zero" position before God can use him.</p><p>May none of us be presumptuous, and may we not disrupt God's work. We should only care for God's command. Even if the work falls, we cannot uphold it with the hand of flesh. We can only do what God wants us to do. God does not want us to be responsible for what is not our responsibility. Even if everything falls down beside us, God will not rebuke us for it.</p><p>Strictly speaking, presumptuousness is the result of human wisdom being unchecked by the cross. What God requires today is for us to hold fast to this fact: We should only do what God commands us to do and not do what He has not commanded us to do. We have to maintain this stand.</p><p>Perhaps some will think that this way is too narrow and that their work will become too common. But brothers and sisters, that day will show whether or not this is the right way. When that day comes, we will see that all works apart from God's will are unapproved and worthless. The judgment seat will reveal all works apart from God's will to be nothing but reasons for rebuke.</p><p>Second Chronicles 26:16-21 tells the story of King Uzziah entering Jehovah's temple according to his own will and burning incense on the altar of incense. He was subsequently punished by the Lord. God's ordinance allowed only the sons of Aaron to inherit the holy office and be priests; only they could enter the temple to burn incense. No one else was allowed to do this. But Uzziah insisted. He was proud to enter the temple and burn incense. God punished him, and leprosy broke out in his forehead. This story is a big warning to us. We can never rashly do what God has not commanded us to do; otherwise, we will suffer God's punishment. Spiritually speaking, leprosy signifies the filth of sin. All those who act presumptuously without God's command have committed a filthy sin before the Lord. Man's zeal is useless in God's work. Man cannot direct God's work with his zeal. It was a good thing to enter the temple and to burn the incense, but since it was not done in accordance with God's will, it became a punishable sin. King Uzziah entered the temple presumptuously to burn the incense. He offended God and was struck with leprosy until the day he died. This is a serious warning for our consideration.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Paul was an apostle of deep spiritual stature. He wrote to the Corinthian saints, saying, "But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you. For we are not extending ourselves beyond our bounds, as if we did not reach you...but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance" (2 Cor. 10:13-15). Paul's word was a word of experience. He said he was not willing to extend himself beyond the bounds which God had measured for him. He would not go to the places which God had not measured to him. He felt it was his responsibility to take care of the places God had assigned to him. But he would not extend beyond his measure to try to take responsibility for the places which God had not assigned to him. If every servant of God had done the same thing, there would not have been so many disputes and sects. Every servant of God has a specific work that God has assigned to him. Every believer has a way that God has ordained for him. If everyone would stand in his proper position, do his proper work, and walk his proper course, the result would be a real glory.</p><p>We should not work because we reckon the work to be good or because a work can save men or render help to others. Our only concern should be whether or not our work is within the bounds of God's measurement for us. The main pillars in a house are important, of course, but all the little nails are equally indispensable. If everyone in the church wants to be a great revivalist or evangelist, how can the church be built up? We should choose the course that is according to God's will. We should not aspire to do only great things; we should stand firm in the position that God has measured to us. We should be willing to become calm and do small works. God is not after great gifts; He is after those who can be used by Him. May we be willing to remain in the position that He has measured to us; this is the proper ground. Strictly speaking, all thoughts of change for the better and all kinds of ambitions and aspirations are worldly, soulish, and fleshly, and we should guard ourselves against these thoughts. Once we are clear about this, we will not dare to touch God's work either lightly or rashly.</p><p>Paul said, "I have finished the course" (2 Tim. 4:7). What course was that? Mrs. Penn-Lewis said the following in her autobiography: "There is a `course' prepared for each believer from the moment of his new birth, providing for the fullest maturity of the new life within him and the highest which God can make of his life in the use of every faculty for His service. To discover that `course' and fulfill it is the one duty of every soul. Others cannot judge what that course is. God alone knows it, and He can make it known and guide the believer into it, as certainly today as He did in the day of Jeremiah and other prophets, and of Paul and Philip and other apostles." The most glorious thing for a child of God to do is to fulfill what God wants him to do within the bounds of God's assignment. God has a preassigned course for every believer to take.</p><p>God uses only those He has chosen for His work; He does not want any volunteers. Those whom God has chosen have no liberty of their own. If you want to be free and take your own course, you will end up with nothing but failure and suffering. If God does not use you, nothing more needs to be said. But if God uses you, you cannot escape from His assigned course. Even if you escape to Tarshish, the waves will still bring you to the sea, and the fish will still bring you back. You cannot run away. God's servants can never act according to their own will. The men God is after are those who carry out only God's assigned work, who run only God's assigned course, and who do not walk according to their own will.</p><p>When Moses led the Israelites through the wilderness, God told them not to work on the Sabbath. When someone reported to Moses that someone had picked up sticks on the Sabbath, Moses did not decide on his own to deal with him. God had not told him what to do. Only after God gave him the clear command to stone the Sabbath trespasser did he dare to order him to be stoned (Num. 15:32-36). Moses would only act after he had received God's command; he dared not do anything on his own.</p><p>If we do not wait, God's work will suffer great loss! How impatient is our disposition! We always feel that God is too slow. We cannot follow God's leading patiently, step by step. Anything we think of as good we jump into hastily, and whenever we see a lack we try to fill it up immediately. We think that if we have to wait in everything, our whole life will be wasted in waiting, and we will not be able to accomplish anything. We have forgotten the fact that those who wait before God and who work according to His command are blessed.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>The one great responsibility we have to bear is to be clear of God's command and carry out His work accordingly. Before we have His command, we should never do anything. God's command expresses His heart's desire. If we want to become a useful vessel in God's hand, we must move only after we have His command. We do not please God by doing what He has not told us to do. Whenever a work is placed before us, we must first ask whether or not such a work is according to His heart and whether it will please His heart. May we seek only after God's will. We should not engage ourselves in a spiritual work just because it is a good piece of work or because the circumstances require our help. Our foremost responsibility in our work is to seek after God's will. If we want to be useful in God's hand, we have to walk according to His will.</p><p>Man cannot randomly change God's pattern on the mount; he must work according to the pattern. Will you say that this is your work and that you can accomplish it without God's will? Or will you say that this is God's work, and you will act only according to His will? It is lamentable that many times God's work has been spoiled under man's fleshly hands!</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should remember that unless our wisdom is first judged and our will first put to death, we cannot do God's work. May God guide us to the point where we are free from the self and our own thoughts and where there is only God's will. Before we engage ourselves in a work, we must first find out whether or not this is God's will. Once we know God's will, we should work according to the pattern that He has shown us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY</h1><h1 class="title">BURDEN AND PRAYER</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Jer. 33:2-3; 1 Thes. 5:19</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Every child of God should have some God-given burden. No child of God can say that God has never given him or her a burden. However, burdens can only be received from God when our spirits are open to Him. An open spirit to God is the condition for receiving burdens from God. Having received a burden, we must learn to discharge it faithfully through prayer. When we have discharged the first burden, we will receive a second, and when the second is discharged, we will receive a third. Therefore, the most important thing is to open our spirits to God. We should say to God, "I open myself before You to pray." Because of our unfaithfulness we often do not receive any burdens; therefore, if we want to be those who bear God's burdens, we must be very sensitive and not reject any feeling that comes from Him. If we feel we should pray for something, we should do it immediately. At the outset, these feelings may be faint, but they will gain in strength as we go on. If we quench the Spirit and do not release our burden through prayer, we will lose our burden. Then the only way to recover it is to confess our sin and thereafter faithfully respond to every God-given feeling. As soon as we are moved to pray, we should pray. As we faithfully discharge the burdens we have, God will continually give us further burdens to bear. The sole reason for not receiving further burdens is that we have not released the burden we already have, and the unreleased burden has squelched us. If we unload the burden, a second burden will follow. A burden may be very faint at the beginning, but we must be faithful to it. If we are faithful to do this repeatedly before the Lord, God will continue to dispense burdens to us one after another. O brothers and sisters, if we hope to be of any use to God, we must recover our lost burdens.</p><p>Burdens are especially related to the work of God. Therefore, we must seek to do His will in everything and wait on Him in His work until He communicates His burden to us. His burden is the manifestation of His will. The burden we receive is the very will of God, and it is also the means by which God manifests His will.</p><p>For example, God may give you a clear and strong burden to preach the gospel. If you go along with it and act according to God's will, the more you preach, the more the burden will be released. The burden may be heavy at the beginning, but the more you preach, the lighter the burden will become. However, if you fail to discharge your burden, it will weigh down heavily on your spirit, and you will feel its weight becoming heavier and heavier as time goes on. Eventually, your feeling will become numb, and you will no longer feel the burden. The life within will seem to perish, and there will seem to be a barrier between you and God. (This does not mean that you will eternally perish, as in the case of eternal perdition; it merely means that you will feel as if your life has ceased.) It will seem as if you can no longer touch God and that the burden has crushed you. All spiritual work issues from such burdens. If you try to work without a burden, your work will be ineffective. But if you work in accordance with the burden that is upon you, your whole being will be increasingly liberated as you advance. You may start off by having a heavy burden, but as you go on, the burden will be released, and you will be uplifted. The value of your work depends on the burden you bear in connection with it. Without a burden, there is no spiritual value to your work. But with a burden, there is spiritual value. Every time you work according to a burden, you will be refreshed and edified. As your load is discharged, you will be edified in the process. If you work without a burden, you will sense that you are laboring in vain and may even be conscious of reproof as you labor. In relation to all spiritual work, you should wait on God for His burden and then set out to discharge it in a conscientious way.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>But this does not mean that we need to constantly look within to discover whether or not we have a burden. Among God's children, there is nothing more damaging than introspection. Let us bear this in mind&mdash;the most damaging thing is to turn our gaze inward. This may be even more serious than sin. Sin is readily recognized as such, but introspection is not detected so easily. An unsuspected disease is always more serious and damaging than an apparent one. If you were asked whether it is wrong to be proud, you would immediately answer that it is obviously wrong. If you were asked whether it is wrong to be envious, you would know quite well that it is wrong. These flaws are obvious. But you can become introspective twenty times in a single day without any sense of wrongdoing. If you quarrel, you soon become aware that you have done something wrong; you quickly identify your sickness. But you can be introspective and be totally unaware of its evil. Looking within is the most hurtful thing in the Christian life. Many Christians are given to introspection, and they are living a life of false spirituality. Before doing any work, they stop and ask, "Do I have a burden for this? Is the feeling I have a burden or not? Is this a burden? What is a burden?" If a man continually asks these questions, he does not know what a burden is.</p><p>Suppose someone asks you to help him carry a table from one room to another. While you are doing it, do you wonder whether this is a burden? Would you say that it is not a burden if it were lighter and that it is a burden if it were heavier? No. As long as something is burdening you, it is a burden. Remember that a burden is what you know, not what you have to discover. If you have a burden, you know it. It is wrong to look inward to see whether or not you have a burden. A burden is known rather than found. It is of great importance to recognize this fact. There is no profit in introspection. The greatest damage a Christian can suffer comes from introspection; it will cheat you. It is not necessary to look for a burden day and night. If you feel that you should preach the gospel to someone and you stop to ask whether or not you have a burden, the opportunity will disappear while you are asking your questions. O brothers and sisters, it is unprofitable to look within. Whether or not you have a burden will be apparent&mdash;either you have a burden or you do not. In both cases you will know; there is no need to discover one. If you have to turn inward to find one, you do not have a burden. There is no need to ask anything. If you have it, you will know. If anything weighs upon you, that is your burden.</p><p>If you feel heavy within, you have a burden, and if you act in accordance with it, you will be liberated. Then you will be free to receive further burdens from God, and you will be edified in the process. All the work of God is done this way. The ministry of prayer is carried on this way. Prayer and work are inseparable. Without prayer, there is no work. Therefore, you have to learn to pick up burdens as well as release burdens through prayer. The Lord may put a certain matter within you and give you a burden for it. If you pray, it will be released, and you will be refreshed. But if you do not pray, you will be crushed beneath the burden. If you do not pray today, tomorrow, or the next day, you will feel bothered whenever you think about it, and the burden will become heavier and heavier because you have not done what you are supposed to do. After setting it aside once or twice, eventually, you will not feel it anymore. If you repeatedly act contrary to your feeling, at a certain point you will not feel it anymore. You will lose touch with God and no longer be able to fellowship with Him. A barrier will develop between you and God because you have betrayed the burden and not acted according to God's direction. Every work has to be conducted with a burden, whether the work is directed toward God or toward men. At the same time, once you have a burden, you should act according to the burden. If you do not act according to the burden, you will become deadened because you have violated God's will. A burden is a necessary requirement in God's work. Once you have a burden you have to work accordingly.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>While it is true that the burdens we have are from God and that our burden is God's will, it is also true that our knowledge mainly governs our burdens initially. There are exceptions. For instance, God may call certain things to our remembrance and may ask us to pray for them, or in the middle of the night God may call us to get up and pray for a brother in a remote place. These experiences do occur, but they are not common, and God does not do this kind of thing very often. Sometimes God cannot find anyone nearby, and He has to go to someone far away; however, these are exceptions. Under ordinary circumstances, God directs men according to their knowledge. This is why we say that knowledge governs a burden in its initial stage. However, after one has knowledge, it does not necessarily mean that he will have a burden. We may know about the condition and everything else related to certain brothers and sisters yet not have any feeling for them or be stirred up within. We have the knowledge, but we do not have the burden. Therefore, burden does not come ultimately from knowledge. Yet knowledge does govern our burden in its initial stage. For example, God may give you knowledge of certain matters and the burden to pray and help out the situation. In this way, the burden comes. A burden can be formed at the beginning through knowledge. Most burdens even have knowledge as their starting point. It is rare for God to start a burden without giving any knowledge of it. There are exceptions. Sometimes God may give you a burden to pray for a brother. He may be sick or he may be in difficulty, but you know nothing about it; you have not received any news from him. Yet God puts a clear burden within you to pray for him. Perhaps after a few weeks or a few months, you may receive a letter from him and find that he was indeed sick and in difficulty. There are cases like this, but they are exceptions. They may happen once in a thousand times. Generally, burdens start from knowledge. Yet this does not mean that knowledge is burden.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Since prayer is a Christian ministry and an important ministry, a question arises: When there is a heavy burden to pray, do we express it through words, or should we be quiet and silent? Can we just bear our burdens silently before God?</p><p>We believe that if God gives us a prayer burden, then He wants it to be uttered. If we have only a few disjointed words, we should express ourselves with these words. Burdens are released only through utterance. If we remain silent before God, the burden will not leave; rather, it will become heavier and heavier upon you. Brothers and sisters, in the spiritual realm, it is an amazing principle that utterance counts. God takes account not only of what we believe but also of what we say. He is mindful not only of the intents of our heart but also of the words in our mouth. Our Lord said to the Canaanite woman, "Because of this word, go. The demon has gone out of your daughter" (Mark 7:29). The few words the woman uttered caused the Lord to work. We may make a request in our hearts, but there is more effect in an uttered request. God seems to require that we speak what is in our heart. The Lord's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane was a crucial prayer, but it was a prayer with "strong crying" (Heb. 5:7). We do not insist on loud prayers. Sometimes there is no need to pray in a loud way. But if there is a heavy burden within, there should be a correspondence between the inner burden and the outward expression. If the burden within is not strong, loud prayers are nothing but noise. But if the burden within is heavy, it must be uttered with audible sounds. If we cannot pray aloud in our homes, let us find a place where we can utter our burden as the Lord did. At times He went to a deserted place (Mark 1:35) and at other times He went to the mountain (Luke 6:12). Even if we cannot go to the wilderness or the mountain, we should pray audibly even if it means praying in a low voice. The important thing is that our prayers have to be audible. If our burden is strong enough, we can find a suitable place to pray. God wants our burdens to be articulated. If we have not articulated our burden, the burden will remain. Some say that they pray silently and that it matters little whether or not the burden is released. This is not true. If a man has not finished the work he has in his hands, he cannot go on to more work. In the same way, if our burden is not released, God cannot give us another burden. We have to discharge our burden with our words so that God can give us a fresh burden.</p><p>But very often our difficulty is that even when we are conscious of a burden to pray, we do not know how to pray when we kneel down. We know that something is weighing within us, but we do not know how to pray. There is a burden in our spirit, but we do not know what to pray. We need to realize that our burden is a matter of the spirit, whereas our comprehension of the burden is a matter of the mind. When our spirit touches our mind, we will understand the nature of the burden in our spirit. When the spirit and the mind touch, both will become clear. Some people feel that they have a burden but do not know what it is. This is because their spirit has not yet touched their mind. Therefore, when their spirit has a burden, their mind does not comprehend the burden. How can contact between the spirit and the mind be established? It is quite simple. If you want to find anything, how should you go about it? If it is to the west and you go east, how would you find it? You would have to circle the globe before you found it. The object may be only a mile away, but you would have walked around the globe before you found it. You should take the point where you are as the center and look around in a circle, moving out steadily from the center to the circumference, expanding the circle as you move. In this way, you can cover all four directions. This is the best way to look for things. When your spirit has lost touch with your mind, you should do the same thing. When you kneel down to pray, do not hold on tenaciously to one thing. That would be like walking in one direction, and you will not find what you are looking for easily. Pray for many things and from many directions. After praying a few sentences for one thing, you may feel that it is not the right thing to pray about. You should drop it and change to another subject. You may have to change your subject two, three, or four times. Or you may become clear after you come to the second subject. You may also have to mention five or six things before you feel that you have touched something that releases your burden; once you pray for this, your mind and your spirit become linked together. You should then pray specifically for that matter in order to release your burden. Once you pray this way, you will feel released, and when you have released your first burden, you will be ready to receive a second burden from God.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>Many Christians cannot be used by God in the prayer ministry because they are over-burdened. They have never released any of their burdens. God gives them a burden to pray, and they may know what it is; their mind and their spirit may be connected, yet they do not pray. Instead, they allow the burden to become heavier and heavier until they are so crushed that they cannot bear it any longer; the feeling for the burden will be gone, and they can no longer pray. Oh, brothers and sisters, the work of God will be seriously hampered if we do not have a free spirit to serve as instruments for His use. If we asked someone to help us with a certain job but found that his hands were full, it would be useless to seek his aid. In the same way, if we are weighed down by many burdens, how can God commit anything further to us? This is why we must release our burdens. The release of the burden will set us free, and God will be free to give us additional burdens. Without this, we will not be able to fulfill a ministry of prayer before the Lord. The ministry of prayer requires a liberated spirit. If we have a burden in our spirit and do not pray for it, we cannot go on to a second thing. If we have a burden but are not faithful to pray and take up the ministry of prayer before the Lord, we will feel heavy the first day, heavier the second day, and still heavier the third day. After a few more days, the burden will gradually go away, and the strength to pray will be gone as well. If we have a burden and do not pray, eventually it will cost us our prayer ministry. We must, therefore, devote time to fulfill our ministry of prayer. The best way to pray is to pray with two or more people; this will save us from being individualistic. Many people have not learned to pray together with others. In praying with others, we must not only pray with our mouths but listen with our ears. If we learn to pray in this way, the "spiral" prayer that we mentioned earlier, praying from the center to the circumference, will come into effect. Through prayer, we can release the burden that God has given us. Prayer frees our spirit and liberates our being. This will allow God to commit fresh burdens to us continually. Today God needs the cooperation of His church on the earth, and we can cooperate with Him through prayer. May there be a way for the working out of His will!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE KEY TO PRAYER</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 7:8; Isa. 62:6-7</h1><p>Prayer is a matter of great importance in the spiritual life of a Christian. Every true Christian realizes this and prays. However, even though some of the Lord's children spend time praying over many matters, they do not seem to get through in prayer. It seems as if they have not found the way to pray. This is because they have not discovered the key.</p><p>In whatever we do, we must first have the key, the secret. If we want to enter a room and the door is locked, we will not find the way in unless we possess the key. Suppose we need two people to carry a table through a door. Some may do it without a problem; but others may do it awkwardly, bumping and banging it in a vain effort to get it through the door. The size of the table and the width of the door is the same; the only difference is with the people who are carrying the table. Some have the key to carrying the table, while others do not. People who have found the key do things well; they are able workers. Once a person gets the key, he can do things twice as fast as others do, while those who do not have the key labor in vain. The same principle applies to prayer. Matthew 7 speaks of principles relating to prayer, one of which is, "He who seeks finds" (v. 8). Seeking requires effort. Anyone who looks in a half-hearted, leisurely manner will probably not find anything. Seeking involves patience and perseverance, and unless we are thorough, we will not find what we seek. If God does not answer our prayers, we must exercise patience and diligently seek the key to prayer. God answered the prayers of many of the saints in the past because they had the key to prayer. By reading the biography of George Muller, the one who founded a number of orphanages, we can see that he was a man of prayer; throughout his entire life, he was always receiving answers to prayer. George Muller had discovered the key. Many earnest Christians pray at great length; they pray wordy prayers, but they do not receive answers from God. In prayer, words are essential, but our words must be to the point; they should be words that touch the heart of God and move Him so that He has no alternative but to grant our requests. Words that are to the point are the key to prayer. These kinds of words match God's will, and He cannot but respond to them. Let us find the key to prayer from a few scriptural illustrations.</p><h2 class="head1">ABRAHAM'S PRAYER FOR SODOM<br />(GENESIS 18:16-33)</h2><p>When God made known to Abraham that He was about to execute judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah for their wickedness, Abraham waited before God. Then he began to pray for Sodom. He did not just open his mouth and say, "O God, have mercy on Sodom and Gomorrah!" He did not beseech God with great intensity, saying, "Oh, forbid that Sodom and Gomorrah should be destroyed!" Abraham laid hold of the fact that God is a righteous God (Gen. 18:25); this was the key to his prayer. In deep humility and with great earnestness, he proceeded to ask God one question after another. His questions were his prayers. As he proceeded in prayer, he stood steadfastly on the ground of God's righteousness. At length he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there" (v. 32). Following this he did not ask or make any more requests. After God answered, we are told that "the Lord went his way" (v. 33). Abraham did not try to hold on to God; he did not try to go on praying. He returned to his place. Some people may think that Abraham should have continued beseeching God and that he should not have stopped with just ten people. However, the Scriptures show that Abraham knew God, and he knew the key to prayer. He heard the Lord say, "The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and...their sin is very grievous...the cry of it...is come unto me" (vv. 20-21). If there were not even ten righteous people in a city, what kind of a city was it? The Lord loves righteousness and hates lawlessness (Heb. 1:9). He cannot cover sin and refrain from judgment. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was the awful consequence of their sin, and it was the manifestation of God's righteousness. When He overthrew those cities, He did no injustice to a single righteous person; He "rescued righteous Lot, who had been oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the lawless" (2 Pet. 2:7). Abraham's prayer was to the point, and it was answered. There was no unrighteousness with God. He did not "slay the righteous with the wicked" (Gen. 18:25). We worship and we praise Him.</p><h2 class="head1">JOSHUA'S INQUIRY ABOUT THE FAILURE AT AI<br />(JOSHUA 7)</h2><p>When the children of Israel attacked the city of Ai, "they fled before the men of Ai. And the men of Ai struck some of them, about thirty-six men; and they pursued them from before the gate unto Shebarim and struck them on the slope. And the heart of the people melted and became like water" (Josh. 7:4-5). After such a mighty triumph at Jericho, why did the children of Israel suffer such a dire defeat at Ai? The only thing that Joshua could do was to prostrate himself before God, seek after God, wait on Him, and inquire into the cause of the defeat. Joshua was grieved on account of the danger that Israel had fallen into, but he was grieved more by the dishonor that was brought to the name of the Lord; therefore, he inquired, "What will You do for Your great name?" This was the key to his prayer. He honored the name of God. His concern was for what God would do for the sake of His own name! When Joshua came to this point, God spoke. He said, "Israel has sinned....Thus the children of Israel are not able to stand before their enemies....I will not be with you anymore, unless you destroy that which was devoted to destruction from among you" (vv. 11-12). God was concerned for His own name and could not tolerate sin among His people. He heard Joshua's prayer and instructed him to discover and do away with the sin that had caused the trouble. After Joshua was clear about the reason for Israel's defeat, he rose up early in the morning to deal with the matter and discovered that the trouble was Achan's sin of covetousness. When Israel had dealt with this sin, their defeat was turned into victory. To tolerate and hide one's sin is to cause God's name to be blasphemed and to give Satan occasion to attack God's people. Joshua did not just open his mouth in undiscerning zeal and plead with God to save His people and make them victorious once again. The dishonor that was brought upon God's great name grieved him, and his plea reminded God to take up the matter for His own name's sake. His prayer was to the point, and it brought an answer from God. Joshua had to first find the reason for failure. He had to discover the sin and deal with it before glory could be given to Jehovah the God of Israel.</p><h2 class="head1">DAVID'S INQUIRY ABOUT THE THREE-YEAR FAMINE<br />(2 SAMUEL 21:1-9, 14)</h2><p>"Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the Lord" (v. 1). David did not simply open his lips and pray, "O God, this famine has lasted three years; we beseech Thee to have mercy on us. Take this famine away from us and grant us a rich harvest this year." No, David did not pray in that way. "David inquired of the Lord." He sought to find the cause of the famine. David's inquiry was to the point; he touched the key. God said, "It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites" (v. 1). God will not tolerate the sin of breaking a vow, and David had to deal with this sin. After he dealt with this, the Word of God records that "God was entreated for the land" (v. 14). David possessed the key to prayer; his prayer was to the point, and his prayer brought God's answer.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRAYERS OF THE LORD JESUS<br />(JOHN 12:27-28; MATTHEW 26:39-46)</h2><p>The prayers of our Lord were always perfect, and they always touched the key to prayer. When He refused to see the Greeks who sought Him, He said, "Now is My soul troubled; and what shall I say?" (John 12:27). He turned the matter over carefully and thought, "What shall I say? Father, save Me out of this hour." No, He knew He could not pray in that way. He realized, "For this reason I have come to this hour" (v. 27); therefore, He prayed, "Father, glorify Your name." This prayer was answered immediately. "Then a voice came out of heaven: I have both glorified it and will glorify it again" (v. 28). If this is the way the Son of God, as the Son of Man, prayed to God on the earth, how dare we on the impulse of the moment open our lips and utter rash prayers! It is essential that we learn the key to prayer.</p><p>That night in the garden of Gethsemane our Lord Jesus was exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. How did He pray under those circumstances? "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will" (Matt. 26:39). He possessed the key to prayer. He had no fear of death, and He was not without His own will. But He did not choose to take His own will; He wanted to take the Father's will. So He prayed a second time, "My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done" (v. 42). He prayed a third time, "saying the same word again" (v. 44). When He was utterly clear concerning the Father's will, He said to His disciples, "The hour has drawn near....Arise, let us be going" (v. 45-46). If our Lord as a man on the earth mastered the key to prayer and set Himself aside in order to seek after God's will, how dare we randomly utter a few words in prayer and conclude we have discerned God's will!</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRAYER OF THE CANAANITE WOMAN<br />(MATTHEW 15:22-28; MARK 7:24-30)</h2><p>When the Canaanite woman was in distress, she cried out in her need, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!" (Matt. 15:22). Was she earnest in prayer? Truly she was. But it is amazing that the Lord "did not answer her a word" (v. 23). The disciples seemed to be in sympathy with her because they said on her behalf, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us" (v. 23). But what did the Lord reply to them? He said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (v. 24). The Lord's reply gave the woman the key to approach Him. She saw that the Son of David was related only to the house of Israel, not to the nations. So she came and worshipped Him, saying, "Lord, help me!" (v. 25). She called Him "Lord," not "Son of David." She realized that only the house of Israel had the right to use that title, so she forsook the wrong ground on which she had been standing and addressed her prayer to Him as Lord. This prayer brought His answer: "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs" (v. 26). The answer seemed so cold that it sounded as though the Lord was rejecting and embarrassing the woman. Actually, He was trying to show her where she stood so that she might know the meaning of grace. The woman saw her own place; she saw the Lord as well as His grace, and seizing the key to prayer, she said, "Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table" (v. 27). This called forth the Lord's commendation, and He said to her, "O woman, great is your faith!" (v. 28). She had found the key to prayer, and spontaneously she had faith. In Mark 7 the Lord said, "Because of this word, go. The demon has gone out of your daughter" (v. 29). Her prayer was answered "because of this word." Her word touched the key to prayer. This is what we need to learn. Often we pray, yet our prayer seems to disappear like a stone dropped into the ocean; it goes away without any answer from God. We have not found the right key to unlock the door; however, we do not try to discover the reason that God has not answered our prayer. Brothers and sisters, how can we expect God to answer such foolish prayers? In all of our prayers we must first find the key; only as we do this can we expect to have constant answers from God.</p><p>Having looked at these illustrations related to prayer, bear in mind that as we pray we should heed the inner voice and not be governed by our circumstances, thoughts, or affections. When that still small voice within tells us to pray, when in the depths of our being we have a sense that we should pray, then we should pray at once. Circumstances should only be a means of driving us into the presence of God to wait on Him; they should not be our master, and we should not be hindered by them from praying. Our mind should only serve to organize our inner feelings, which should be then expressed in words; our mind should not be the source of prayer. Prayer is the expression of the inner feelings through the mind; it does not originate in the mind. Prayer according to the will of God is only possible when we are in harmony with His will; it is not an exercise of forcing God to oblige man's emotions. Unless our emotions are dealt with, it is impossible for us to pray; prayers will not have a way to be released. Once we are under the control of our emotions, we will pray in a natural way according to our subjective desires; it will be hard to pray according to the inner leading. Therefore, we must touch the key to prayer. Whenever we find ourselves praying ineffectively, fruitlessly, and insufficiently, we must ask the Lord for light and seek to discover the cause. As we inquire of the Lord, we will reach a point at which we feel that we have gotten through, when something within clicks, and a still small voice within says, "That's it!" We have found the key to prayer. As we use the key and pray on, we can be assured that God will answer our prayer.</p><p>Isaiah 62:6 says, "Upon your walls, O Jerusalem,/I have appointed watchmen;/All day and all night/They will never keep silent." These watchmen are men of prayer. They have to be on watch tirelessly in order to know if something is happening and cry out when it does. A man of prayer must be one who reminds the Lord continually. This is not the work of one individual or a few men; there is the need for a group of men to pray this way. "All day and all night they will never keep silent." These are companies watching together, and together they discover something, and together they pray unceasingly to God. Their prayers do not cease "until He establishes/And until He makes Jerusalem/A praise in the earth" (v. 7). We must persevere in prayer until the Body of Christ is built up. God needs our prayers. He wants us to have a spirit of prayer, the atmosphere of prayer, and the key to prayer. Brothers and sisters, let us arise and learn to pray. Let us seek the key to prayer so that we may meet God's need today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">SATAN'S WEARING-OUT WORK</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Dan. 7:25</h1><p>Satan always works to attack God's children. His attacks are not sudden; they often come gradually. According to Daniel 7:25, Satan will wear out the saints of the Most High. One of Satan's strategies against the saints of the Most High is to wear them out. We must remember that Satan's work among God's children is not apparent; he works by wearing them out.</p><p>What does it mean to wear someone out? It means to exhaust a person minute by minute, some today and some tomorrow. The wearing out goes on invisibly, yet in a debilitating way; it goes on imperceptibly, yet the end is total depletion and waste. Satan works in God's children by the principle of wearing them out. He wears us out a little today and a little tomorrow. He causes us to suffer a little today and a little tomorrow. We may think that this is insignificant, yet the result of this wearing out by Satan is total depletion.</p><p>This is why the Bible says that the love of many will "grow" cold (Matt. 24:12). The girl who was possessed by a spirit of Python cried out "for many days" (Acts 16:17-18). When Festus wanted money from Paul, he sent for him "frequently" and conversed with him (24:26). Delilah pressed Samson "every day" with her words (Judg. 16:16). Satan wears out God's children gradually, repeatedly, frequently, and daily. The "evil day" in Ephesians 6:13 refers to Satan's wearing out. We must ask the Lord to open our eyes to see Satan's wearing-out work and how we can resist it.</p><h2 class="head1">WEARING OUT MAN'S BODY</h2><p>Satan is particularly good at wearing out the physical bodies of God's children. Job's body was stricken (Job 2:7-8), and Paul had a thorn in his flesh (2 Cor. 12:7). This was Satan's wearing out of their bodies. Some Christians had healthy bodies before they were saved. After they are saved they become sick, and their health deteriorates. If God opens our eyes, we will see that Satan is always plotting and planning to deal with God's children. Many of God's servants experience the same thing when they set out to preach the gospel. Before they set out to work and preach the gospel, they have no problems with their health, but once they start to work and preach, their health breaks down within a period of three to five years. This is Satan's wearing out of the saints of the Most High. He depletes men of a little food today and a little sleep tomorrow. He makes them a little tired today and a little tired tomorrow. The cumulative effect of this tiredness eventually destroys their health completely. This is Satan's work.</p><h2 class="head1">WEARING OUT MAN'S HEART</h2><p>Satan wears out not only man's body but also man's heart. When you first believed in the Lord, you may have been very happy, joyful, and peaceful. But if you are not watchful and do not know the work of Satan, you will suddenly become restless one day, unhappy another day, and depressed a third day. Little by little your peace will be lost, and your joy will be gone. You will become weary and discouraged. This is Satan's work in wearing you out.</p><h2 class="head1">WEARING OUT MAN'S SPIRIT</h2><p>Satan also tries to wear out man's spirit. He takes away your prayer little by little; he takes away your trust in God little by little. He causes you to trust in yourself more and more and believe that you are cleverer and cleverer. He causes you to trust in your gift and distracts your heart from the Lord little by little. If Satan struck God's children with a powerful blow all at once, they could withstand him because they would realize that it was the work of Satan. But his most evil work is not to strike just one blow but to wear you out over a long period of time. He causes God's children to fall behind little by little and backslide little by little. This is the way Satan wears out God's children.</p><h2 class="head1">WEARING OUT MAN'S TIME</h2><p>Satan also wears out man's time. For example, Festus sent for Paul to converse with him frequently. A man as powerful and as gifted as Paul preached to Festus for two years, yet he was still not saved. This is Satan's wearing out of man. Festus would send for Paul, and there would be no result. The next day he would send for Paul again, and there would be no result. He continually sent for Paul, but there was no result. Satan engaged Paul in work with no result. At the end of two years, there was still no result. This is Satan's wearing out of man.</p><p>If God's children do not know Satan's strategy, they will be deceived. We should redeem the time, and each hour should be counted as an hour. We must stop Satan from wearing out our time and engaging us in fruitless work.</p><h2 class="head1">WEARING OUT SAMSON'S CONSECRATION</h2><p>Samson's failure was not as serious as the loss of his consecration. He could not afford to lose his testimony of separation. Once he lost his consecration, he lost his power; once he lost his testimony, he lost God's presence. Samson was a Nazarite. Satan knew that the source of Samson's power was in his consecration; therefore, he focused his efforts on this very crucial thing&mdash;he tried to take away Samson's consecration. How did Satan do it? He used Delilah, who pressed Samson daily with her words. Eventually, Samson's soul was vexed unto death, and he told her all that was in his heart, revealing the source of his power. The result was that he fell into Satan's snare; he lost his consecration, his power, his testimony of sanctification, and God's presence. This daily, pressing work is the work of the enemy.</p><p>If the Lord opens our eyes, we will see that Satan uses many methods to wear man out. He can wear us out physically, circumstantially, or spiritually. He does not attack fiercely; rather, he wears out slowly. Therefore, we have to be aware of his wearing out. We must not allow him to continue his wearing-out work; we must oppose it.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING DISGUSTED WITH SATAN'S WEARING OUT</h2><p>When Paul was preaching in Macedonia, he met a girl possessed by a spirit, who followed him, crying out, "These men are slaves of the Most High God, who announce to you a way of salvation" (Acts 16:17). She cried out this way for many days, until Paul felt disgusted at heart. He turned to the spirit and said, "I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her" (v. 18). The spirit came out that very hour. Spiritually, we need such a feeling of disgust. We need to be disgusted not with men but with the demons. Paul was truly disgusted with the spirit; he was not disgusted with the girl. When Paul charged the spirit to come out of the girl, he was treating the girl as a third party. When the devil tries to wear us out, we should have the same feeling of disgust as Paul.</p><p>If you know that Satan is wearing you out, you have to pray for God to give you a feeling of disgust, that is, a feeling of disgust and anger with Satan! Many people can get angry at men, but they cannot get angry at the devil. If others offend them, they break out in a fit of anger, but when the devil wears them out, they do not feel a thing. Paul was worn out by Satan to the extent that he became angry. Once he opened his mouth to rebuke the spirit, the spirit went away. Hence, we must not keep our mouth shut all the time; we have to declare something. It would be wonderful if God's children would become angry with Satan and rebuke him. If anyone becomes angry with Satan, we will say, "Hallelujah, this is wonderful!" Some people are very weak; they allow Satan to wear them out. This is too poor. God's children should become angry with Satan. They need to be disgusted with him. Once they become angry and disgusted, everything will be set right.</p><p>We often keep silent and endure while Satan is wearing us out; we try to suffer silently. But at a certain point, we become disgusted and angry, saying, "I do not agree with this! I do not want this!" This speaking and anger will deliver us and stop the wearing-out work. God's children should stand up to reject Satan in disgust; they should rebuke Satan. Some people have never experienced deliverance or release because they still have the "strength" to endure. A man who endures Satan's wearing out and allows Satan to waste his energy, joy, and spirit has fallen into Satan's trap. We are not saying that we should be angry with those men whom Satan has used; we must be patient with them and still love them. But we should oppose and reject the strategies and methods of Satan. If we oppose Satan's work, we will be freed and liberated.</p><p>The power to reject Satan comes from realizing his pressure. Some believers have been deceived and attacked by Satan. They withstand it and oppose it, yet they do not feel that they have any strength. This is because they have not seen the pressure of Satan. We often oppose and reject him, yet we do not have any energy to raise our voice. This is because we have not seen Satan's pressure. Whether or not we can reject Satan depends on whether we are disgusted with him. If we are not sufficiently disgusted with him, our speaking to him will be like speaking to the air; it will not produce any effect. But when we truly become disgusted and angry with him, the anger will become our strength, and the minute we open our mouth, he will go away.</p><p>Such a feeling of disgust comes from revelation. Once we see that Satan is wearing us out, we must oppose him. Once we see this, Satan cannot do anything more; he will realize his hopelessness. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we see Satan's wearing-out work. As long as we tolerate and endure him, his work will continue. But the minute we feel disgusted and become angry with him, Satan will go away. We must realize that no other kind of withstanding will work. Satan will withdraw only when we withstand him with our words. If we do not see this and allow him to go on, he will not stop. When we see that Satan is doing the work and plotting everything, we must say, "I do not want this. I oppose this." God will then bless our withstanding, and it will become effectual.</p><p>Finally, let us read Ephesians 6:13. Paul said, "Having done all, to stand." We must stand and not allow Satan to continue wearing us out. May the Lord open our eyes to see Satan's wearing-out work on God's children. We have to reject this, and we have to speak up. We have to say, "I reject this. I oppose this. I do not accept this wearing out." We must not accept any kind of wearing out from Satan; we should oppose it and reject it. If we do this, we will witness the Lord's deliverance and release, and we will be freed from Satan's wearing-out work.</p><p>Such words require the covering of the blood. May God cover us with the blood.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">WORDS</h1><p>Words are one of the most important things in our lives. The Lord Jesus said, "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (Matt. 12:34). This shows that words express a man's heart; they show what is within a man's heart. If a man does not open his mouth, it is not easy for us to know his heart. But as soon as he opens his mouth, his heart is exposed. If a man does not speak, no one will know his spirit. Once he speaks, however, others will touch his spirit through his words; they will know his condition before the Lord. We can judge a person by the words he speaks.</p><p>Therefore, a believer must be very careful with his words. He must learn to speak the proper words. In the Bible, there are four or five places that tell us how to speak. Let us consider them one by one.</p><h2 class="head1">LIES</h2><p>First, we must not speak lies. John 8:44 says, "You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions; for he is a liar and the father of it." When Satan speaks a lie, he speaks out of his own possessions, for he is a liar. He did not learn his lies from others. He is the father of lies. Satan damaged God's creation in the garden of Eden with lies. He has to lie in order to overturn God's work. Lying is a sin more common than any other sin. There are as many people who lie as there are people under Satan's hand.</p><p>As soon as man is saved by God, the first lesson he should learn is to reject any lie. He should reject inaccurate words, words that add to or come short of the truth, and intentional or unintentional lies. Lies should not be found in a child of God. If lies remain, it means that he is giving Satan the ground to maintain his grip.</p><p>If a man has never learned to reject lies, he will not realize how often he lies. The more a person tries to reject lies, the more he will find out that he is simply a lying person; even his heart is inclined towards lying. There are more lies in this world than we can think of, and there are more lies in us than we expect. If we have never learned to reject lies, we will not know how many lies there are. But once we resolve to reject lies, we learn how many lies there are in us. What a pity that among God's children, so many lies still exist! The Lord's word is clear and serious&mdash;Satan is the father of those who lie. In other words, all those who lie are the children of Satan. It is a pitiful thing for God's children to allow Satan's lying seed to remain in them! Brothers and sisters, we should not be believers for many years and yet never make a resolution to deal with our lies. Such a dealing is long overdue. As soon as a man believes in the Lord, he has to learn to speak accurately.</p><p>There are many kinds of lies; some are obvious, while others do not seem like lies at all. In reality, however, they are still lies. Some examples can be seen in the following:</p><h2 class="head2">Being Double-tongued</h2><p>Being double-tongued (1 Tim. 3:8) is speaking something in one circumstance and speaking something else in a different circumstance. It is saying that it is all right to do something to one person and not all right to do the same thing to another person. It is switching between yes and no and changing unpredictably. This kind of speaking is a lie.</p><h2 class="head2">Speaking according to One's Emotions</h2><p>Many people do not speak according to the truth or according to facts. Instead, they speak according to their likes and dislikes; they speak according to their emotions. If they like something, they speak a certain way. If they like a person, they speak a certain way, but if they hate something or some person, they speak another way. This is speaking according to our emotions rather than according to reality. This way of speaking is also lying. We must realize that we should not speak according to our feelings but according to facts. We should not speak according to our emotions. A Christian should learn to control his emotions to the extent that he will not speak according to his wish or imagination. Many people's words do not reflect facts; they reflect their imagination. When they wish that a certain sister would be good, they tell others how good she is. When they think a certain brother is about to fall, they tell others how bad he is. Actually, the one they say is good is not necessarily that good, and the one they say is bad is not necessarily that bad. Their words are based on their imagination rather than on facts. Man often speaks what he hopes to see and what he imagines to be true; his words do not reflect the true condition of a matter. We must learn to deal with this kind of speaking.</p><h2 class="head2">Adding One's Own Thoughts</h2><p>Many words are greatly twisted after they pass through a few mouths. A word may pass from one man to another and then to a third and so on. Three or four mouths will turn the word into something totally different from what it was originally. This is because everyone wants to add his own thoughts. When one adds a little and another adds a little more, the whole thing eventually becomes completely distorted. When one person conveys something to another and does not speak according to the facts, adding some of his own thoughts into the speaking, he is lying. Therefore, when we report something, we have to learn to speak before the Lord according to the facts and not put in our own thoughts. If we want to speak our own thoughts, we should clarify that this is our opinion. We should separate our opinions from the facts and not mix them together. Otherwise, we are lying.</p><p>If you want to test a brother's heart before the Lord, all you have to do is tell him something and ask him to pass it on. You can easily find out how his heart is before the Lord. A person who fears the Lord, who has learned the lesson, and who has been dealt with by the Lord considers speaking to be a great thing. He will not dare speak rashly or pass on things lightly. He will always try to speak accurately. A person who has never been dealt with by the Lord and who has never been disciplined will pass on words enthusiastically. The way he relays the words will expose him as a flippant, vain, and dishonest person. As he passes words around, he adds his own words and says many things that should not be said. This kind of person can never preach God's Word. He cannot study the Bible properly, because God's Word is accurate to the last iota and serif (Matt. 5:18). A person who is careless will surely make mistakes concerning God's Word.</p><h2 class="head2">Exaggerations</h2><p>Another common lie is exaggeration. Exaggerations are manifested in inaccurate numbers or in the use of exaggerated words or expressions that are not true. These are lies. Sometimes a person likes to magnify the mistakes of others. A person may be wrong thirty percent, but those who exaggerate will say that it is fifty percent. At the same time these ones try their best to speak lightly of their own mistakes. This is also to lie.</p><p>After a man is saved, his speaking has to be severely disciplined by the Lord before he can become an honest person. Let me say a strong word to all of you: A man must reject lies again and again. Every time there are inaccurate words, he has to reject them. He may need to reject them for three to five years before he can be an honest person. A man who is careless in his speech cannot be honest. A common fault with many people is their lies; they speak inaccurate words. There is no need for a person to learn to lie. As soon as a child is able to talk, he lies. Wise and foolish men alike lie; the only difference is that some are more skillful at lying, while others are less skillful at lying. But whether or not they are skillful, it is lying just the same. Since lying is so common, we have to learn to deal with it. Whenever there is a lie or we touch a spirit of lying, we should be aware of it.</p><h2 class="head1">IDLE WORDS</h2><p>Second, we cannot speak idle words. Matthew 12:35-37 says, "The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things. And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned."</p><p>In verse 33 the Lord Jesus says, "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known." Following this, He describes the way man speaks. This proves that the fruit spoken of here is not man's conduct but his words. If the fruit is good, it proves that the tree is good, and if the fruit is bad, it proves that the tree is bad. If a man is good, his words will surely be good, and if a man is evil, his words will surely be evil. Some people gossip, criticize, slander, and tear down others with their words all day long. They say all kinds of unclean, filthy, and evil things. This clearly proves that the tree is bad.</p><p>If God's children have such faults in themselves, it is impossible for them to help others overcome the same faults. If some brothers and sisters spread unhealthy, filthy, or sinful things all the time, there is no need to ask whether the things are true or false; the very spreading is in itself unclean. A man's words are his fruit. One cannot find a man with a pure heart spreading filthy things. Nor can one find a man with a loving heart spreading hate. The fruit proves the tree. This is not a matter of being true or false. A person may be speaking facts, definite facts, but the facts should not have come out of his mouth in the first place. The facts may be true, but they are not words that one should say. The issue is not whether something is true or false but whether or not one should say it. It may not be a lie; it may be a fact, yet as long as it is an idle word, we should not speak it, and we need not speak it.</p><p>The Lord said, "Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment" (v. 36). Brothers and sisters, idle words spoken by a Christian are not over once they are spoken; they will be repeated again a second time. Today you may have spoken something rashly. But one day, you will have to say the same thing again before the judgment seat. When you say it the second time, you will be justified or condemned according to your word. Hence, God's children should learn to fear the Lord and reject all inaccurate and idle words. A word that does not edify oneself or others should not be uttered.</p><p>Whether or not a man has been dealt with by the Lord can be seen from the words he speaks. Those who have been dealt with by God have their mouths checked. Those who lie and speak idle, careless words are of little use to the Lord. The only thing they can do is wait for the judgment to come. Those who speak filthy words are surely filthy in themselves. Those who speak corrupting words are surely corrupt in themselves. The kind of words you speak proves the kind of person that you are. One tells the tree by its fruit, and one tells a person by his words. From the day we are saved, we should learn to be dealt with by the Lord in our speaking.</p><h2 class="head1">EVIL WORDS</h2><p>Third, we cannot speak evil words. First Peter 3:9-12 says, "Not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing one another, because you were called to this, that you might inherit blessing. For he who desires to love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips to speak no guile. And let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it; for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears incline to their petition; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."</p><p>There is one kind of word which must not come out of a Christian's mouth&mdash;evil words. What are evil words? They are revilings and cursings. God's children cannot render evil for evil or reviling for reviling. Many people say, "Since they said this, I can say it also." Men are concerned about who says something first, but the Lord asks whether you have said it at all. You may say, "Everybody is saying it. Can't I say it too?" Please remember that you cannot render evil for evil or reviling for reviling. It is not a matter of who spoke first but a matter of whether or not you said it. You have to control your temper before you can control your words. If you do not control your temper, many evil words will come out. When God's children become loose, they speak reviling words. If we speak reviling words, we will not glorify God, nor will we receive any blessing from Him.</p><h2 class="head1">BRIDLING OUR TONGUES</h2><p>James 3 specifically touches the matter of our speaking. Let us read verses 1 to 12. We will highlight a few of these verses. Verse 2 says, "For in many things we all stumble. If anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well." If a man cannot bridle his words, he cannot bridle himself. In order to see whether or not a man has self-control as a fruit of the Spirit, all one has to do is see whether he is controlled in his speaking. For a Christian, self-control means to be able to control oneself. The ability to control oneself is a fruit of the Spirit. Galatians 5 shows us that self-control is a fruit of the Spirit. James 3 shows us that the most obvious manifestation of this fruit of the Spirit is in our speaking. If a man can control his tongue, he will be able to control his whole body. Those who speak carelessly must live a careless life. Those who speak in a disorderly manner must live a disorderly life. Those who are indiscreet with their speaking are surely indiscreet with the other faculties of their body. Whether or not a man is able to bridle his whole body can be seen from the way he bridles his tongue.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if we want God to be merciful to us and touch us, we have to deal with our words. If God can deal with our words, He can deal with our whole being. With some people, their words are the center of their whole being; their words are their backbone, the hollow of their thigh. In order for God to deal with such persons, He must first deal with their words. Many people have not been properly dealt with by the Lord because their speaking has never been dealt with. Nothing exposes a person more than his speaking. Once a man opens up his mouth to speak, his whole being is exposed. Whether or not a person is able to bridle himself can be seen from the way he bridles his tongue.</p><p>Verse 3 uses the bridle as an illustration, while verse 4 uses the rudder as an illustration. Man's tongue is like a bridle; it is also like a rudder. It is something very small, yet it can affect a great deal. Verse 5 says that a little fire can ignite a forest, then verse 6 says, "And the tongue is a fire; the very world of unrighteousness, the tongue is set among our members as that which contaminates the whole body and sets on fire the course of life and is set on fire by Gehenna." The tongue is a world of its own, a world of unrighteousness. Many people have not been dealt with in the matter of their tongue, and the tongue brings them into a world of unrighteousness; they spread death everywhere and set aflame the fire of Gehenna. There is a very strong word here: The tongue can set the course of life on fire. This means that it can produce many activities of the flesh. Man's flesh, temper, and anger can all be lit up by the tongue. The tongue can set aflame the fire of Gehenna. Many evil things are stirred up through one word; such a word is truly from Gehenna. The tongue is a fire and a world of unrighteousness. If we want to save ourselves from blemishes in our speaking, we must learn to bridle our words. Those who open their mouths often inevitably make mistakes. Many proverbs repeatedly advise men to be discreet with their words. It is foolishness to be talkative. The more foolish a man is, the more he has to say. But the more a man learns his lessons before the Lord, the more discreet he becomes and the less he has to say.</p><p>Verses 7 and 8 tell us that every creature can be tamed but no one is able to tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. We must realize how foolish it is to unbridle our tongue.</p><p>Verses 9 to 12 say that we cannot bless the Lord and curse the men whom He has created with the same tongue. We cannot bless and curse at the same time. A spring cannot gush forth sweet and bitter water out of the same opening. A fig tree cannot produce olives, and a vine cannot produce figs. Neither can salt water produce sweet water. A certain kind of tree bears a certain kind of fruit. A certain kind of spring gushes forth a certain kind of water. Those whom God uses will surely gush forth sweet water which will not have any bitter taste to it.</p><p>God's way of salvation is to put a new spring within us. He is saving us by making us a new tree. If we are a fig tree, we will surely not produce olives, and if we are a vine, we will surely not produce figs. Once God puts a new life within us, we will gush forth sweet water spontaneously.</p><h2 class="head1">LISTENING TO THE WORDS OF OTHERS</h2><p>We must pay attention not only to our speaking but also to our listening. If the brothers and sisters know how to listen, they will eliminate much improper speaking. Many improper words are running rampant because many people like to listen to them. As long as there are those who like these things, they will find an outlet. There are so many defiled, evil, gossiping, dividing, double-tongued words because there are those who want to hear these words. Man's heart is evil, crooked, and unclean. As long as there are those who want to hear these things, there will be those who speak these things. If we, as God's children, want to know the kind of words we can or cannot say, we should first know the kind of words that we should and should not hear. We cannot make our ears a trash can and allow unclean things to be dumped into us. We have to reject the defiled, unclean, and corrupting words and not allow them to lodge in us.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if you hear any improper speaking, you must not be distracted by it; instead you should say, "I don't want to hear it!" If you do this, you will stop many sins and help many people. Some people have a lust to listen to these things. This causes these words to multiply more and more, and more and more people will have an interest in them. Brothers and sisters, when someone speaks some inappropriate words, you should either walk away silently, which will kill his interest in continuing, or tell him clearly that such words are unbecoming to a Christian, which may stop him immediately. Many words are like fire from Gehenna; one must quench them the minute they start, before they begin to spread. When many troubles arise, those who speak bear the major part of the responsibility, while those who listen bear a minor part of the responsibility. Man has a lust for idle words; he craves strange things. If we can deny this lust, we will quench many fires from Gehenna. When someone says something bad, we should say, "Sorry, as a Christian I cannot listen to this kind of speaking." Once we take a stand this way, we will stop these words. If we intently listen while others are speaking enthusiastically about certain things, hoping that they speak more so that we can hear more, we are not quenching the fire; rather, we are adding fuel to the fire. We are making the fire burn stronger.</p><p>Psalm 38:13-14 says, "But I, like a deaf man, do not hear; /And I am like a dumb man, who does not open his mouth./Indeed I am like a man who does not hear/And in whose mouth there are no reproofs." Many people should behave like deaf men. When others speak improper words, we should be like deaf men, hearing nothing. Many times we have to learn to be deaf and to ignore these words. Words are a great temptation, and we have to learn to overcome them. If we listen to unclean and vain words less, we will sin less and avoid much trouble.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have to be disciplined in our words; we have to learn to speak, and we have to learn to listen. We have to learn to fear God in the matter of our words. This is a great matter and a very particular lesson. We should learn this lesson properly. This is not something that comes cheaply; we have to put in much effort before we can build up a habit of speaking accurately. Speaking accurately is not easy. The minute we slip a little, our words err and our motives veer. Sometimes we may be right in the things we say, but our motive is to mislead others. This is lying. Therefore, we must pay attention to this matter and put considerable effort into dealing with this matter.</p><p>Psalm 141:3 says, "Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth;/Keep the door of my lips." We need this kind of prayer: "O Lord, guard my tongue so that I will not speak carelessly." Perhaps we should add another word: "O God, guard my ears so that I will not listen carelessly." We must reject all fruits of corruption. We should not give any opportunity for the poisoning stench to spread. We must not allow the tongue to carry us into looseness, ungodliness, and rebellion. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we learn to speak as well as listen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE PROTECTION, RESTRICTION,<br />AND SUPPLY IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22-23; 4:16; 5:21; 6:10-18</h1><p>In this chapter we would like to consider a few matters related to the Body of Christ. These matters concern: (1) the protection of the Body, (2) the restriction of the Body, and (3) the supply of the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROTECTION OF THE BODY</h2><p>The church is the Body of Christ, and every Christian is a member of this Body. The Body not only supplies all the members but protects them as well. Protection by the Body is very crucial for the members in spiritual warfare. God's children suffer the devil's attack because they are too individualistic and do not have the protection of the Body. It is foolish as well as dangerous for anyone to expose his head or exhibit himself in days of warfare. Such ones do not come under the sheltering of the Body, and they afford Satan the opportunity to attack them. Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter but the work of the church. Ephesians is on the Body of Christ. Chapter one speaks of the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies that God has given us; the result is that we see the power of the resurrection of His Son. At the same time, chapter one also shows us that the Lord Jesus is the Head of the church and that the church is the Body of Christ, the vessel which contains Him. The Christ who fills all in all also fills the church. This is why the church is exceedingly rich. Chapter two speaks of how the church is produced. Although the church is rich, it should not forget its former condition. It attains its position of riches through the saving grace of God. Chapter three is on the mystery of God, which created one new man from the Gentiles and the Jews. Chapter four is on God's building of the Body and how the Body grows. Chapter five is on the church as the Body of Christ and how we should be restricted by this Body. Chapter six is on the armor of the Body. In 6:11 "you" is plural, which means that the whole armor of God is not for individuals. This special armor is for the Body. Every member has his particular function, and when these functions are put together, we have the whole armor of God, and we can engage in spiritual warfare.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, the spiritual armor is for the church, not for individuals. You cannot deal with Satan alone; you need the church to deal with him. Other members can see what you cannot see as an individual. Other members can garrison what you cannot garrison as an individual. Satan is not afraid when you pray alone, but when a few come together to pray, Satan will tremble. Some are outstanding in their faith, and they have the shield for protection. Others are particularly gifted with God's word, and they have the sword of the Spirit. When they exercise their sword and speak God's word, you receive help. Spiritual warfare is a corporate warfare; it cannot be fought by individuals alone. If you go to battle alone, Satan's attention will be directed toward you as an individual, and he will attack you as an individual. Those who do not see the Body think that they can do everything and that they are everything. These are the ones who are most likely to fail. It is easy for a single tree to be blown down by the wind, but it is not easy for a whole forest to be blown down by the wind. Satan is seeking for those without any covering and is concentrating his attacks on these isolated and independent ones. Whoever is under the covering of the Body is under protection. One of the functions of the Body is protection. Those who are under the protection of the Body will not suffer Satan's attacks. If a man is not under the protection of the Body, he will live as if the church does not exist; he will not see the Body of Christ. If he does not encounter assaults, nothing will happen; but the minute he faces an assault, he will fall. The experience of many Christians testifies to this fact. A certain brother was physically weak because he was an individual in the Lord's eyes; he did not have the protection of the Body of Christ, and he came under the attack of Satan while he was trusting and boasting in himself. Brothers and sisters, it is extremely dangerous to expose ourselves; it is very precarious to put our trust and confidence in ourselves. A battle in the physical world requires protection, and a battle in the spiritual world also requires protection. If a brother does anything independently, even though he is a good brother, he will be setting his own trap! Many spiritual defeats and failures happen when a person is alone and does not have the covering of the Body. Brothers and sisters, we are only members in the Body, and we cannot go on without the protection of the other brothers and sisters. Even Moses' hands needed the support of Aaron and Hur (Exo. 17:12). If Moses needed support from other members, how much more do we need support!</p><p>The gates of Hades cannot overcome the church. The Lord Jesus said, "The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" (Matt. 16:18). The gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church. The Lord Jesus never said that God's children can be independent and leave the church. Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter but a matter in the Body. If we want to have protection, we have to be among the brothers and sisters. Never think that we can go to war alone; this only invites trouble. However, unless we are dealt with in our natural life, we cannot put our trust in the brothers. If the natural life is not dealt with, a man is not only incapable of trusting in God, but he is incapable of trusting in the brothers as well. No stubborn or self-trusting person can walk in the footsteps of his brothers. God is after those who know themselves. He is after those who find their protection among the brothers. The vessel God is after is the whole Body. We are only members in the Body; this is why we need the help of the Body. Those who cannot be joined to the brothers and sisters, who do whatever they want and go wherever they want, will surely end up in failure. Is there no brother or sister they can fellowship with? Is there no brother or sister they can pray with? Brothers and sisters, whenever we do not have the Body, we do not have any protection, and we fall into trouble. A battle in the physical world requires covering. Throwing away one's own covering when covering is needed is a tactical mistake; such a risk will bring in nothing but death. The same is true with spiritual warfare. Brothers and sisters, if we do not have any protection and have not encountered any danger, we can only say that God has been merciful to us; we cannot say that we comprehend spiritual tactics.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESTRICTION OF THE BODY</h2><p>We are only one member in the Body of Christ. We should not consider ourselves to be everything. Since we are merely a member in this Body, we should accept the restriction of the Body. Brothers and sisters, if you are a hand, you must be willing to remain a hand and also to come under the restriction of the other members. You must not allow yourself as the hand to act freely. Every part of the Body has to be restricted by the Body; no part can move independently. For example, you may want to leave your house. If some members of your body are lazy and do not want to leave the house, they still have to go along with your body. You cannot have the whole body leave while one member remains in the house. The same is true with your movement as a member of the Body of Christ. You must go with other brothers and sisters.</p><p>The work of the cross not only brings us into the Body, but also the Body becomes the very realm within which the cross works. If we were here only as a congregation, we might not need the cross. However, since we are together as the Body, we cannot go on without the cross. The cross will dig away our natural life, our own activities, and any disproportionate growth. The cross is indispensable to the church; it is indispensable among Christians. Whether or not we like it, we have to communicate with other brothers and sisters because we are all in the Body. Because we are in the Body, we have to be restricted and cannot be so free. If we were not members, we could seek our personal enjoyment. Since we are members, we cannot seek our own enjoyment anymore. If we come across a troublesome brother, we need to take up the cross. The cross will test us and sift away all our mixture and uncleanness. We must come under the restriction of the Body. The restriction of the Body will take away our freedom; it will drive us to the cross. Only after the cross has wrought a deep work in us will we be able to coordinate with the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Every Christian is a member of the Body of Christ. Hence, every Christian should come under the restriction of the Body of Christ and learn to bear the cross. Some have a very strong disposition. Such a strong disposition must be broken. Some are very peculiar. Such peculiarity must also be broken. No Christian can boast of his strength or his peculiarity in the church. In the church, anything sharp, glaring, or conspicuous has to be worn away.</p><p>Spiritually, we all need to depend on the other members, and we all need the restriction of the Body. God may grant grace to some to be miracle workers, and He may grant grace to others to be gospel preachers or teachers. If you can only preach the gospel, you should be satisfied with your function of preaching the gospel and humbly accept the Bible exposition of those who have the gift of teaching. If you have the gift of teaching, you should not think that you have everything; you should also honor and receive others' work. You have to learn to be restricted and allow others to do what you cannot do yourself. You have to learn to accept others' work as well as your own. In the spiritual work, no one is free to do everything.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, have you asked God to show you the measure He has given you? You should walk in the measure that God has given you. You can only walk within your measure; you cannot walk beyond that measure. Hence, you have to find out where the boundary of your measure is and accept this boundary. If you do this, you will not be covetous, ambitious, or restless to do many other things. Paul said, "But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you....We are not boasting beyond our measure in others' labors, but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance, so that we may announce the gospel unto those parts beyond you, not so that we may boast in another man's rule in things already prepared" (2 Cor. 10:13, 15-16). To go beyond one's measure is to overstep others; it is to intrude upon others and to push others out. We must remember that consecration leads to submission to Christ, whereas humility leads to submission to the Body. The psalmist said, "Nor do I go about in things too great/Or too wondrous for me" (Psa. 131:1). Things too great and things too wondrous are the things that are beyond one's measure. If everyone behaves this way, and if no one exercises himself in great matters or in things too wondrous for him, every member will function according to the measure of each one part. Otherwise, some in the church will withdraw while others will take over, and the church will suffer a loss. We should return to our position in the Body and be restricted by the Body. In this way the church will not suffer any loss.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SUPPLY IN THE BODY</h2><p>One principle of the Body is fellowship. The fellowship of the Body is not just a matter of receiving but also a matter of supplying. If you think that all you have to do is receive and behave in an orderly and quiet way without causing any trouble, you do not know what is meant by the fellowship of the Body. You have become a hindering stone, a sickness, and a burden to the Body. Brothers and sisters, you have to remember that fellowship has to do with the life of the Body. Fellowship is the principle of the Body. Every part of the Body is open to continuous circulation. Whenever any part of the Body is cut off from fellowship, it becomes dead. Whenever a part is sick, the other parts will come to its rescue. This is the law of our physical body; it is the same with the spiritual Body. The principle of the Body life is mutual supply. Whenever a member acts against this law, he brings death into the Body and becomes a burden to the Body.</p><p>Paul told the Corinthians, "Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up" (1 Cor. 14:26). Many come to meetings as spectators; they are bystanders. To come to the meeting in this way is to bring death to the meeting. A meeting often dies at the hand of the bystanders. Brothers and sisters, we must supply each other not only at the bread-breaking meeting but also at the message meeting.</p><p>Every part of the Body is in circulation, and no one can be stagnant. Anyone who becomes stagnant is halting the life of God and bringing death into the Body. It is impossible to have one member stagnant without causing damage to the Body. No member can be useful without the supply of the Body. Some become hurt and decide to hide themselves and to be alone, pursuing spirituality individually. But let them try and see whether they can truly be spiritual. Life cannot become stagnant. Never think that a person can be spiritual by hiding in a place alone to have a spiritual retreat. The vessel God is after is a Body, not individuals. Those who are independent and detached from the Body will not last for long.</p><p>The Lord Jesus was thirsty one day as He sat by the well of Jacob. But the Samaritan woman was thirstier than the Lord. When the Lord gave her the living water, she was satisfied. When the disciples came back with food, the Lord was no longer hungry (John 4:5-34). When we serve others and quench their thirst, we become satisfied. When we learn to bear others' burdens, our own burden becomes light. There is no retirement in spiritual work. The Lord Jesus said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working" (John 5:17). Whenever we stop functioning, we stop living. A Christian must supply others not only in meetings but also in his daily life and work.</p><p>May the Lord open our eyes to see the Body, to have the protection of the Body, to be restricted by the Body, and to supply others. May the Lord show each one of us that we all have a part in the meeting. It is not enough for us to speak about the Body; we have to practice the Body in our living. The Body of Christ is not a doctrine but a real life. Brothers and sisters, if we find that we can live and walk without the protection, restriction, and supply of the Body, we have not seen the revelation of the Body of Christ. After a person has received God's life, he will feel dry if he walks according to his natural life. In the same way, after one has received the revelation of the Body of Christ, he will feel wrong as soon as he walks in an individualistic way. If we do not have the revelation, it is easy for us to forget this, and we will remember it only as long as we remember the doctrine. But if we have this revelation, the revelation itself will become a law of life in us, and there will be no need to remember anything. For example, we do not have to remember to blink our eyes; spontaneously our eyes blink. If we have received the revelation of the Body of Christ, spontaneously we will feel the need for the Body; there will be no need for us to remember anything. Those who walk according to outward laws are the Jews, and those who live according to their memory are living according to the law and not according to life. If we are touched by the Lord within, and if our eyes are opened to see the Body of Christ, we will spontaneously live in the Body. Therefore, the most important thing is to have revelation. God is recovering the life of the Body rather than the doctrine of the Body. The Body of Christ is a life. The Body of Christ is a matter of experience, and we have to enter into the reality of this Body. Brothers and sisters, if we are in the Body of Christ, we will know that it is something real and concrete. We must not only understand the principle of the Body of Christ, we must also see the principle of the Body of Christ. If we see the Body, we will have the Body life spontaneously.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">HOLDING THE HEAD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22; 4:15-16; Col. 2:19</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>In order for God to establish Christ as the Head over all things, He must first make Christ the Head of the church. God must first make Christ the Head of the church before this headship can extend to include all things. The future position of Christ in the universe has much to do with His position in the church today. God must first secure Christ's headship among His children, that is, in the church. This is why it is a crucial matter for Christ to be the Head of the church.</p><p>Christ is the Head of the church, and the church is the Body of Christ. The whole Body is headed up under the Head. Nothing in the Body can exist apart from the Head. If the Body is detached from the Head, the only result is death. Every movement of a human body is governed by the head. If the head is injured and loses its function, the activity of the whole body will cease, and the body will not be able to survive. The head is the hub of the life of the whole body. God's Word tells us that those who have the Son of God have life. A Christian receives life from the Lord, yet this life is never detached from the Lord. Those who have the Son have life, yet this life is still in the Son. This life is never for a moment apart from the Son. Without the Lord, we cannot live. Brothers and sisters, God does not give us a piece of Christ; He has given us the whole Christ so that we may be tightly joined to Him. The power of our existence comes from Christ. If we lose our fellowship with the Lord and if we move away from Him, we will immediately become lifeless. A Christian receives life from the Lord, and the life he possesses is still in the Lord. It is true that we have received life, but this life cannot be separated from the Head. After we have received Him, we must still abide in Him and trust in Him. Therefore, we cannot be independent in anything, because only the Lord is the Head and only He is the source of our life.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Christ is the life of the Body; He is also the authority of the Body. Since life is in Him, authority is also in Him. Since He is our life, He has authority over us. Whenever we submit to His authority, we have life. Every move of our body is governed by the head. For Christ to be the Head means for Him to have the authority in the Body. Brothers and sisters, if we see what the Body is, we will spontaneously come under the control of the Head. The Body cannot move freely; it can only move at the direction of the Head. Without direction from the Head, the Body cannot move. The Body is under the authority of the Head; it cannot propose anything on its own. The power to direct the Body rests with the Head. Where life is, there is authority. In fact, true authority is life. Since the Lord governs our life, He has authority over us.</p><p>Those who say with their mouth that they understand the life of the Body need to ask themselves further whether or not they are under the authority of the Lord. Whether we are under the authority of the Head determines whether we know the life of the Body. Toward God's Word, some have the attitude: "Although the Lord has said this, yet..." Who has given us permission to say "yet"? What authority do we have to say "yet"? In the world anyone who disobeys the command of his superior is lawless. If Christ is the Head, then we cannot be the Head and we have no right to disobey Him.</p><p>What does it mean to follow? To follow means that someone else decides your footsteps and destiny. This is the meaning of following. To follow the Lord means that you have no right to decide your own way. Have you ever said to the Lord that He is the unique authority and that you do not have any choice of your own? The only responsibility the Body has toward the Head is submission and obedience. If you want to live the life of the Body of Christ, you must cover your head and not have any opinion, proposal, or thought of your own. You can only submit to the Lord and allow Him to be the Head. If the Lord is the Head, no one else can be the head. You cannot be the head, nor can anyone else in the church be the head. The Body can only have one Head and can only submit to one Head. Only Christ is the Head, and therefore, you must submit to Christ.</p><p>However, many times there are too many heads in the church. There are many human leaders, methods, and ordinances in the church. Man wants to be the head. Christ is the Head in heaven, and man wants to be the head on earth. When the "head" on earth agrees with the Head in heaven, there is obedience. But when the "head" on earth does not agree with the Head in heaven, there is disobedience. How wrong this is! In the church only Christ is the Head; there is no other head. As long as Christ is the Head, no one else can be the head. Brothers and sisters, have you ever said to the Lord, "Lord, You are my Lord. I have no right to make any decision, and I have no right to choose anything. May You deliver me from being my own head and from taking anyone else as the head"? Brothers and sisters, we must all learn to receive orders from God. Christ is the Head, and no one can walk according to his own will. It is a basic Christian experience to surrender to the Lord and submit to Him.</p><p>Acts 2 shows us Peter's preaching of the gospel: "God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified" (v. 36). The minute he opened his mouth, he spoke about Christ as Lord. Christ is not only the Savior but also the Lord. We all need to have the Lord as our Lord, and since we have all sinned, He must be our Savior. Consider Paul's experience when he was saved on the way to Damascus. The Lord shone His light on him, and he asked the Lord, "Who are You, Lord?" (9:5). Paul first saw Him as Lord and then believed in Him as the Savior. Brothers and sisters, if our eyes are opened, we will say, "Lord, I am through. From now on, take control of me; be my Lord."</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Hence, we must hold the Head. Holding the Head means that we recognize only Christ as the Head; it means absolute obedience to the authority of Christ. We have to hold Christ as our Head. Ephesians 4:15-16 says, "We may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love." The members are joined together through holding the Head and living the Body life. God is not satisfied with us just taking care of those around us. He wants us to hold the Head; He wants us to have a proper relationship with Christ. Once we have a proper relationship with Christ, we have a proper relationship with the other members. If we hold the Head, everything else will follow. If we can submit to the Head, our problems with other brothers and sisters can be solved easily. If we do not have a problem with the Lord, we will not have any problem with other brothers and sisters. Whether or not we can live the Body life properly depends on our relationship with Christ. If our relationship with Christ is proper, our relationship with everyone else will be proper. Brothers and sisters, we did not become Christians just because other Christians were amiable or because we found a set of methods to live a successful Christian life. We became Christians through knowing Christ. The way we were born is the way we should live. We were born through developing a relationship with Christ. In the same way we should live by maintaining a proper relationship with Him.</p><p>This does not mean that there should not be any fellowship between Christians. It means that the mutual fellowship among Christians is based on their individual relationship with Christ. Because the Christ who lives in me cannot be separated from the Christ who lives in you or in others, there is a need for mutual fellowship among us. The Christ who lives in us is not fragmentary, but one. Christ is in you, and He is also in me. This Christ is the basis of our fellowship. Other than Christ, we have nothing to fellowship about. Our educations, backgrounds, and abilities are all different. But there is one thing we have in common&mdash;Christ. The Christ in us is the same; this is why we can have fellowship one with another. All those who belong to Christ can fellowship one with another. Those who do not belong to Christ cannot participate in this fellowship. We do not fellowship with a certain person because he is capable, mild, considerate, or gentle. If our fellowship is based on man, we are not holding the Head, and our fellowship is merely Absalom's fellowship. Absalom's fellowship drew the Israelites away from David. This is not holding the Head. Mutual fellowship among Christians must be based on each person's relationship with Christ. We cannot have another basis of fellowship outside the Head. If we hold the Head and others hold the Head, the mutual fellowship between us and them will be proper and beneficial. But if we do not all hold the Head, the fellowship will run into trouble. How far are we going to go as Christians? Are we going to follow the Lord all the way to the end? If some have left the proper way a few stations back, they are no longer on the proper path. How can we still fellowship with them? Therefore, if we want our fellowship to last to the end, we must follow the Lord to the end. Please remember that fellowship is based on our mutual holding of the Head.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>What are the conditions for holding the Head? In order to hold the Head, we must allow the cross to deeply deal with our flesh and our natural life on one hand, and learn to walk according to the Spirit on the other hand. Only then will we have the full fellowship of the Body. If the cross has not dealt with the natural life, we cannot live the Body life. The book of Revelation mentions a group of people who follow the Lamb wherever He goes (14:4). Can we say that we follow the Lamb wherever He goes? The cross is the means that brings in the fellowship. Once the cross has dealt with our flesh and broken the self, we can go wherever the Lamb leads us. If there is no barrier between us and the Lamb, there will be no barrier between us and the Body. If our relationship with the Head is proper, our relationship with the Body will also be proper. Suppose the left hand is hurt. The head directs the right hand to help the left; the right hand does not move independently by itself. The mutual relationship of the members first goes through the head. If you hold the Head, you will help others because of the Lord, not because of human affection. Whenever you consider how others have wronged you, it proves that you are not holding the Head. If you are holding the Head, you will always be helping others for the Lord's sake. Once your relationship with the Lord becomes proper, your relationship with other brothers and sisters will also become proper. If you hold the Head, you cannot build up any direct relationship with others, and you cannot have any special affection toward a few.</p><p>God does not allow any division or parties in the church. What is a party? It is when a few Christians have direct communication with one another without communicating with the Head. They have a special friendship between themselves which does not issue from their love for the Lord. This is to form a party. More serious than the forming of parties is the forming of sects. Some are too close to one another; they have too much affection for one another, and they become a sect. If we are holding the Head, our heart must be as large as the Head. All the brothers should love one another, but this love has a foundation. Love is something in the Body of Christ. Our mutual love is a love that is based on the Body of Christ. Any love that is outside the boundary of the Body is something that God does not permit. Christians must love one another by holding the Head. This is the only way to prevent us from becoming a party or a sect.</p><p>In the church the knowledge of the truth, the handling of affairs, and everything else must be based on our holding the Head. The greatest problem in the church is the multiplicity of opinions. One portion of the Scripture may have a few interpretations, and someone may agree with a person while another may disagree. One matter can be viewed in different ways; some may insist on one view, while others insist on another view. If no one holds the Head or if we do not all hold the Head, there will be arguments. Paul said, "Is Christ divided?" (1 Cor. 1:13). Christ cannot be divided. The corporate Christ is one, and He will not give us two different views at the same time. The disunity among God's children is the result of not holding the Head. When we encounter any problem, we engage ourselves in disputes. Yet this is not the way to solve problems. If we will kneel down and pray in one accord and acknowledge Christ as the Head, matters will be solved easily. Spiritual things are never judged according to human opinions, thoughts, or doctrines, for these are not holding the Head. The Holy Spirit is working within us. The Holy Spirit is bringing us to the end of ourselves through sufferings, trials, and experiences. Then He will give us revelation which causes us to hold the Head; only this kind of holding is reliable. God will bring us to the end of ourselves through sufferings. Then He will give us revelation. Once we have revelation, spontaneously we will hold the Head. God's revelation is constituted into our life. This is something beyond dispute. To hold the Head is to hold what the Lord has given us. Differences of opinion often come from the proliferation of human opinion and concepts. If our opinions are not from the Head, they are vain. Who among us is qualified to express his own opinion? All expressions of self-opinion are of no value at all.</p><p>God's goal today is that His children live the Body life on earth. In order to manifest the Body life, we must hold the Head. Brothers and sisters, are we holding the Head? May the Lord bestow His grace to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">THE BREASTPLATE OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 28:6-7, 9, 12, 15-21, 29-30; 2 Cor. 11:28-29; 7:3; Heb. 13:17; 1 Pet. 5:1-3, 5-6</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>In His selection of men on earth, God first picked out one man. From this one man, a house was developed, and from the house, a nation was formed. The one man was Abraham, the house was the house of Jacob, and the nation was the nation of Israel. When there was one man, God appeared to him, spoke to him, and revealed Himself to him. When the man became a house, God appeared to the head of the house, spoke to him, and revealed Himself to him. After the Israelites were delivered from the bondage of slavery and after they turned back to God's authority, name, and administration to be the kingdom of God, the Bible shows us that God changed His method of revelation. He no longer spoke and appeared to individual men as He had before. Instead, He revealed Himself to His people and spoke with them according to a prescribed way.</p><p>What was this way? It was the breastplate of judgment. Through the breastplate of judgment, God revealed Himself and spoke to His people. In the past God had spoken to one man, but in speaking to a nation He spoke through one object: the breastplate of judgment. When God's chosen people became a nation, God changed His way of speaking. Whenever troubles and problems arose among God's people, they went to God and sought His guidance and revelation through the breastplate of judgment. I hope that the brothers and sisters will remember this. When you are alone, as Abraham was when he served the Lord by himself, God speaks to you alone. But when God's people are around you and you become one of God's people, you should remember that God's way of revelation changes.</p><p>This does not annul a man's personal communication with God, and it does not annul God's appearance and revelation to individuals. However, when you follow God as Abraham did, He speaks to you individually, appears to you individually, and gives you revelation individually. But when God's people are around you, something important happens. Even though your individual communication is not annulled, you are no longer alone. Instead, you are mingled with the people of God to become one being and one entity. Then God's revelation and His speaking are not directed toward you individually but toward the people of God. There is a change in God's method of speaking and revelation to His people. Brothers and sisters, we must see this in a clear way. We must see that we are mingled as one Body with all the saints. Under such circumstances, God reveals Himself and speaks and appears to man in a different way. If we have not seen this, our fellowship with the Lord may not be stopped, but our service to God will surely be off. If we want to serve the Lord and meet the need of God's children, we have to realize that God's appearance and revelation to individuals is different from His appearance and revelation to His corporate Body. Brothers and sisters, you have to realize that God's revelation to Abraham was by one way, and His revelation to the nation of Israel was by another way&mdash;the breastplate of judgment.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>The high priest wore the breastplate when he went to God; it was placed on the ephod. The breastplate was square and folded into two layers; four rows of stones were set upon it. Each row had three stones, upon which were inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. Moreover, two stones were upon the shoulderpieces, with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel inscribed on them as well. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel represented the whole people of Israel, that is, they represented the people of God. When the high priest entered into the presence of God, he did not go in alone; he had the twelve tribes of Israel on his shoulders and upon his breast. The high priest is a type of the Lord Jesus. This speaks of the Lord shouldering us and embracing us upon His breast. When the high priest went into the tabernacle to fulfill his service to God, he had to put on the ephod. He had to have all of the Israelites upon his shoulders and had to come to God with all of them upon his breast.</p><p>When the Israelites encountered a problem that needed to be solved, the high priest had to put on the ephod and the breastplate and come into God's presence to seek His speaking and revelation. The breastplate was called the breastplate of judgment because from it man found his solutions. Moses asked God to appoint a man to rule over the congregation, and God answered, "Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom the Spirit is....And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, and he shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah" (Num. 27:18, 21). When the Amalekites invaded Ziklag and took the women and the people captive, both great or small, David inquired of the Lord to see whether he should pursue after the troop, and the Lord said, "Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all" (1 Sam. 30:1-8, 18-19). This shows that after God's people grew from one man into a nation, God spoke to them through an instrument&mdash;the breastplate of judgment.</p><p>Within the breastplate of judgment there were the Urim and the Thummin. Urim in Hebrew means light, whereas Thummin in Hebrew means perfection. When the high priest went into God's presence with the breastplate, God's light shined and His will was fully manifested.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, although the breastplate is something in the Old Testament and there are differences in outward form between the Old Testament and the New Testament, God works according to the same principle in both testaments. The things in the Old Testament are shadows, while the things in the New Testament are realities. Yet the New Testament realities are the same in principle as the things in the Old Testament. Therefore, God's way of revelation to His people is the same as His way of revelation to His children. When one, two, three, or five of God's children are humble and fearful before the Lord and when they discover some problems among God's children or His Word is not clear among them, what should they do? They have to learn to shoulder and embrace God's children and inquire for them before God. Paul was one who shouldered God's believers and had the churches of God on his heart (2 Cor. 11:28-29). When he went before God with a breastplate of judgment, God's light shined. He saw the one who sinned in Corinth, and he also comprehended the word of spiritual mystery which he wrote to the church in Ephesus. Why was Paul able to write and present God's way so clearly before the churches of God? He was not ignorant or unconcerned about the affairs of God's children, nor did he receive light in a cloister while praying as a hermit. This was not Paul's way. He had the churches of God and His children upon his shoulders and breast. He came to God with a fearful heart, and the Father of light shined on him and revealed the needs of the churches which he was shouldering and embracing. Therefore, his letter to the church in Corinth was what the church in Corinth needed, and his letter to the church in Ephesus was what the church in Ephesus needed. Paul wrote his letters to the churches according to the same principle as the high priest who sought God's light with the breastplate of judgment. The affairs of the churches of God were upon Paul's shoulders and upon his heart. Paul was not nonchalant about the affairs of the churches, nor did he pray mindlessly. He did not casually pray a few words and then write to the church in a particular place and then pray another casual prayer and write to another church. Paul did not do this, and no saint should do this. We have to understand the principle of bringing the Lord's saints into the presence of God. Paul brought the children of God with him as he looked to the Lord for many days. When he saw something in God's light, he wrote a letter based on that light. On another day he would see something else in God's light, and then write another letter based on that light. Brothers and sisters, in order to understand God's will and way for His people and for the church, there must be some who will shoulder God's children and embrace them, bring them into God's presence, read their condition in God's light, and then write down what they have received before the Lord. This is the way God reveals Himself to His children in the church.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>The affairs of the church are decided by the principle of the breastplate of judgment. The experienced, God-fearing, and godly ones among God's people should shoulder and embrace His children and bring them to the Lord. They should read their condition in the light of God and make judgments accordingly. Decisions in the church are not made through the dictates of one or two men. This is not God's way. You may ask, "Did not the churches at the time of the apostles obey the apostles?" Yes, they did. But the apostles first brought the people of God to His presence and asked for His revelation. They did not dictate their orders like a pope.</p><p>The affairs of a church are not carried out by one or two men giving all the orders and the rest going along with the orders. Should the affairs then be decided by a vote of hands? No, that is not God's way either. Then what is the proper way? The elders in the church should bring the condition of the children of God to Him and inquire about them. The elders are the matured ones among God's children. Being advanced in years does not make a person an elder. Spiritual experience and condition distinguish one as an elder. An elder must be godly and know the condition of the brothers and sisters. When a problem or doubt arises in the church, a decision is not made by one person or by a vote of hands. The elders have to bring the condition of the brothers and sisters before the Lord; they have to go before the Lord with the saints' situations, discuss them, and seek common guidance for them. Although we cannot guarantee that the outcome will be a hundred percent right, we can say that it will be difficult for them to err. We have to remember that once God's people become a corporate entity, His method of revelation changes. Thereafter, God reveals Himself through His people; He places His heart's desire within His people. In fact, His speaking is His echo to His people. Before the elders speak, God has put something within the brothers and sisters already. When the elders bring the brothers and sisters to the Lord and read their condition, they see a message which God has revealed within the brothers and sisters. This message is the present need of God's children; it is also God's need among them. Only this kind of message will touch God; only this kind of message will touch the children of God, and only this kind of message will touch God within all of them. God reveals Himself through His children. Hence, decisions in the church are not made by a few people nor by a show of hands, but through a group of elders who uphold the people of God in His presence in a fearful way, asking God for His enlightening and revelation. This is the way that God guides His children in the church. The elders in the church should learn to know God's will and to understand the condition of His children and always have them in their hearts. Once a problem arises, they should bring His children to His light and read His mind concerning the solution to the problem. The Epistles in the New Testament were written according to this principle. The writers of the Epistles understood the mind of God and the condition of all the churches. Their hearts were with the affairs of the churches, and when they received some light from the Lord, they wrote it down. As a result, no word was wasted. These written words became God's revelation and His Word.</p><p>When we do not judge according to this principle, we fall into error eight or nine times out of ten. Often God's servants see light and truth through the brothers and sisters. God's servants often receive divine revelation through the ones with whom they have fellowship. Often we receive God's word when brothers and sisters are around us; when they are not around us, we do not have God's word. In deciding any matter in the church, we must follow this principle. In this way we will be preserved and not fall into error.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, do you feel that this subject does not interest you? You have to realize that this is not just a matter of procedure. There are some spiritual lessons to be learned here, and you can see the need of the breaking of the cross here. If you want to live according to the principles mentioned above, you need the breaking of the cross. If a church does not take the dealing of the cross daily, God has no way to speak to this church. Elders, apostles, old, and young alike have to welcome the breaking of the cross. Only then can God speak clearly. The elders in particular must take the dealing of the cross. Every move and word of the elders affect the brothers and sisters. They should not only read the condition of the brothers and sisters but also bring their affairs before the Father of light, pray over them again and again, and discuss them thoroughly before they make any decision. This is a crucial principle, one that is against your concepts. Among God's children, however, the elders are not the only ones who should keep this principle; God is inside the youngest brother and sister as well, and they can still affect&mdash;revealing or obscuring&mdash;God's will among His children. Therefore, every brother and sister have to learn to be restricted by God in what they do and say. They have to learn to be broken by the cross. If every brother and sister behave this way in a certain place, that place will become the place where God speaks the most.</p><p>No one should despise another one in the church. A brother may have bothered you again and again, but even his opinion must not be despised. If you trample his opinion under your feet, one day you will be sorry. Brothers and sisters, this word comes from the mouth of those who have learned this lesson through much suffering. You should not despise anyone, and you should not look down upon anyone. You have to bring even their complaints and attacks before the Lord and read them, and you must bear them upon your shoulder and inquire of God for them. You cannot be arrogant. David took others' rebukes to the Lord and read them before the Lord. Brothers and sisters, do not presume that those who agree with you are the only ones who know God's will. It is often your opposers who make you understand God's will. If there is anything that can keep you from faltering in your footsteps, this principle is the only one. If you do not want to offend God's heart or the brothers' and sisters' hearts, you have to live according to this principle in an absolute way. Only this principle will drive away your prejudice and your view, and only this principle will allow you to read the mind of the brothers and sisters before the Lord. The words you find will be the word that God intends to speak to His children. Only this principle will allow God to unveil His heart to His children, and only this principle will satisfy the heart in heaven as well as the hearts on earth.</p><p>Suppose a few elders in the church decide on a matter and carry it out accordingly. Another brother may not feel right about it, yet he dares not say anything rashly because of his fear of the Lord. What is the result of this? The result is that the organic function of the Body of Christ is stifled through this decision. Then what is the right way? Before a matter is carried out, God must first operate among His children. Before the elders try to carry out a matter, they should first bring the condition of the brothers before the Lord. Whatever comes out of such a reading will strike a sweet cord and a nod of approval in everyone. The elders should seek God's will according to this principle. Otherwise, a decision may end up being contrary to God's operation within His children, and the announcement of the decision will not bring about an echo within His children. God's Spirit will not vindicate this matter within His children. As a result, the organic function of the Body of Christ will be obstructed. If the elders would read the condition of God's children under His light and do this thoroughly before making any decision, the decision would produce an echo within His children; it would bring anointing to His children and motivate His children. If they do not do this, the organic function of the Body of Christ will stop. Brothers and sisters, we must ask God to deliver us. We need not only the structure of the Body of Christ but also the organic operation of the Body of Christ. Only then will the function of the Body be manifested. This principle applies to every brother and sister; everyone has to realize this principle.</p><h2 class="head1">SIX</h2><p>There is another thing I would like to point out&mdash;the matter of authority. What is authority? Superficially speaking, authority is based on position; whoever has position has authority. According to the Bible, this also appears to be the case, but actually, this is not the case. Authority is not mainly a matter of position; it is primarily a matter of life. When the people of Israel saw the budding rod of Aaron, they acknowledged his authority. Without resurrection life, authority is useless. Authority in the church is not mainly a matter of position but a matter of life. You do not become an authority by others' election, and no one can claim authority based solely on his position in the church. David submitted to the authority of Saul because he feared God, but Saul was rejected by God because he rebelled against Him. He had only the position of a king, not the life of a king. God did not vindicate his authority. This was not a case of David rebelling against the authority, but a case of God not vindicating it. God cast Saul down and set him aside. The authority of the church is a matter of life. The amount of authority one has depends on the degree to which the resurrection life of God lives within him. The more he gives up God's resurrection life, the more gives up his authority. The Bible says that the elders should not lord it over the flock but should be a pattern to the flock. A pattern is an expression of life. It is wrong to put on a sober expression and assert that one is an elder and that he has authority. If anyone among us demands submission in a pretentious way, others have to put a big question mark on his authority. In the church all the brothers and sisters have to learn to humble themselves and submit to one another. Authority is a matter of living out the proper pattern in love. Only this will cause God's children to submit from their hearts. May the Lord be merciful to us and give us some excellent patterns.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">LIVING BY THE LAW OF LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:1-2</h1><h2 class="head1">THE FAILURE OF LIVING BY THE WILL</h2><p>In the Christian life an important principle is to live not by one's own will but by the law of the Spirit of life. Many Christians, especially the young ones, do not see this, nor have they learned this lesson. The strength of their living is dependent upon their will and sustained by their will. They dare not put aside their will for even a moment, because they know that they will stumble and their Christian living will cease. The living of many Christians is dependent upon their will. Brothers and sisters, even if you have been a Christian for many years, do not think that you no longer live by your will. Many still maintain their Christian living by their will. Perhaps you still do not know the extent to which your will occupies your living and how much ground you have given your will.</p><p>The person in Romans 7 is one who lives by his will. The "evil" is his acts, and the "good" is his will. Therefore, he says, "For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice" (v. 19). All of his "good" is in his will. He can comfort himself by saying, "I want God; I want God's will; I want to obey God's will." He can comfort himself also by saying, "I do not want to sin, I hate sin, and I want to serve Him; my sole purpose is to please God." He can say, "I want God's will and I want to please God; I want to do only things that are good, and I will glorify God's name." He may make many resolutions in his will, but he can do nothing more. There is a gross misconception in his thinking that whether or not a man can do good is dependent on whether or not he wills to do it. He does not see that doing good or evil is a matter of a law, not a matter of the will. He does not see that even if he has decided to do good, he will only experience failure and disappointment.</p><p>Quite a few brothers and sisters say, "I truly want God's will, I truly want to please God, and I am truly doing things according to God's law." A brother may be saying these things and at the same time wonder, "Why don't I receive what I seek before God, and why am I doing all the things that are contrary to my will?" Many brothers and sisters wonder and say, "Why can't I do what I will, and why do I instead do what I do not will?" Brothers and sisters, God wants to show you one thing in this situation: Your willpower cannot be the power of your living. Perhaps you still do not know how much you live by your will. Therefore, let us first take a look at how man lives by his will.</p><p>A clear sign of living by the will is refusing to let go. Many people refuse to let go of themselves. This does not mean that Christians do not need restrictions. But many Christians hold on to themselves; they will not let go of themselves. It is an arduous task being a Christian who puts a very tight grip on himself, thinking that a Christian must be careful in the way he eats, the way he walks, the way he rides a streetcar, and the way he talks with his family. From morning to evening he keeps a firm hold on himself in order to behave like a Christian and in order to walk, eat, and travel properly. It seems that one can only be a Christian when he firmly holds on to himself and carefully bridles himself! He thinks that once he lets loose of his grip, he will fail. This is the situation of many Christians who live by their will. They firmly hold on to themselves in an effort to live like Christians; they force themselves to act like Christians. This is like trying to make a stream flow upward. Many Christians are trying to make water flow upstream; they force themselves to behave like someone they are not. Many people compel themselves to be like someone else. They are not that kind of person, but they stubbornly try to be that kind of person. What do they do? They exercise their own will to put a tight hold on themselves. Many people strenuously try to be Christians this way. They make the strength of their will the power of their life.</p><p>We should remember that if we have to exert so much effort to be a Christian, we are surely not this kind of person. If we were this kind of person, we would not need to expend such a great effort. Oh, there are many things which are difficult to turn our eyes from! There are many things which are difficult to refuse, and there are many foods which are difficult to resist. How much effort do we need before we can control ourselves? How much effort do we need before we can refrain from speaking improperly? How much effort do we need before we can refrain from going places that we should not go? There are things that we naturally like to do, and we spontaneously do them. If we want to stop, we must force ourselves not to do them. For example, if you were raised in Shanghai, do you need to say, "I am determined to speak Shanghainese; I must speak Shanghainese; I will speak Shanghainese. I need to be careful not to speak the Shantung dialect or the Cantonese dialect"? No, you do not need to will yourself to do this, because you are a Shanghainese, and you will naturally speak Shanghainese. But if you are not a Shanghainese and you want to speak Shanghainese, you need to exert effort to speak it.</p><p>To live by the will is to try to be a certain type of person when you are not. When you try to force yourself to be a certain type of person, the only thing you can do is exercise the will. We are land creatures, and it is natural for us to live on land; if we want to live in water, we must exercise our will.</p><p>There are two kinds of people who try to be Christians according to their willpower. First, there are those who have not been regenerated; they have not been born of God and have never received God's life. Therefore, they must exert considerable effort to compel themselves to be Christians. Many so-called Christians are actually not Christians at all; they are merely trying to be Christians. Since they want to be Christians, they sing a few hymns because other Christians sing hymns, and they say a few "hallelujahs" because others say hallelujah. But whether singing hymns or saying hallelujahs, they do it all with considerable unease. When other Christians speak, it is real, but when they speak, they do not feel a thing. People who are like this are pretending to be Christians; therefore, it is very unnatural for them. Second, there are those who are born again and who are God's children, but who do not believe in the life that God has given them. They have the life, but they do not live by this life. Their salvation experience is unclear; their regeneration experience is also not clear. They did not hear the complete gospel, and they have not fully believed in God's Word. They fail often and are weak to the uttermost. They cannot believe that the life within them can swallow up death. They are accustomed to sin and have failed constantly; therefore, they concede that no other experience is possible. They consider themselves as standard Christians. Thank God, they are absolutely wrong. Brothers and sisters, just because you have not experienced the mighty power of God's life, do not say that the life that God has given you is as weak and powerless as you are. Thank God that His life comes with great power! As long as a man dares to believe in God's Word, God's life will manifest its mighty power in him. God's life cannot manifest its mighty power in many people because they either do not have the life or they have not fully believed. When one genuinely believes, he will testify that God's Word is fully trustworthy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIBERATION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>Paul cried, "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?", and one day he experienced deliverance. Then he said, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death" (Rom. 8:2). This is not a new grace but a new revelation; it is not a new gift but a new vision; it is not receiving something new from God's hand but discovering something that God has already given. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed us! According to the Greek "freed" is in the past tense; it is already "freed." The law of the Spirit of life has freed us! The verse does not say, "going to free," "will soon free," "can free," or "intends to free," but "has freed." The law of the Spirit of life has already freed us; therefore, we are delivered from the law of sin and of death.</p><p>We need to realize that the experience and the acts in Romans 7 are unnecessary. Hallelujah! There is no need to go through the experience in Romans 7, and there is no need to act according to Romans 7. The exercise of the will in Romans 7 is even more unnecessary. Suppose your surname is Wang. You have had the surname for decades, and every day your surname continues to be Wang. You do not have to exercise your will to call yourself Wang or resolve to be surnamed Wang, because your surname is Wang. If you are a Wang, you do not need to desire to be called Wang. If this is your desire, it means that you are not a Wang. Here you should see one thing: If you are in the Lord, the Lord will use a law&mdash;the law of the Spirit of life&mdash;to free you from another law. Once you see this, you will immediately say, "Thank the Lord! Praise the Lord! I do not need to exercise my will anymore. If I release my grip, I will not fall to the ground; I will fall into another law." Thank the Lord, this is a fact. All experienced Christians understand the meaning of these words.</p><p>Many Christians fear that if they let go or if they do not exercise their will to act like Christians, things will become unpleasant. Many Christians say, "I cannot let go of myself. If I let go of myself, things will be unpleasant. Even though I am keeping a tight grip on myself, I still cannot speak or walk properly; I am still weak and failing. What would happen to me if I let go?" Many Christians are obsessed with this fear and dare not release their grip. But God's Word is very clear! If we believe in what God has already given us and release our grip, we will not fall to the ground; rather we will fall into a new law.</p><p>May God open our eyes to see that no one can resist the law of sin by his will; nor can anyone resist the law of sin by willing to do good. No one can do the will of God or resist the law of sin and of death by his own will. The will can never contend with the law of sin and of death! Thank and praise God! There is another new law that can contend with the law of sin and of death. Thank and praise God! This is not only a new life; this is also a new law.</p><p>Oh, what a joy that this life is a law! God has given us not only the Holy Spirit but also the law of the Holy Spirit. God has given us not only life but also the law of life. In the past we were dead in our offenses and sins; we had not only sin and death but also the law of sin and of death. We did not have to resolve or force ourselves to sin. Rather, there was a law that compelled us to sin. If God had only given us a life and nothing else, it would seem reasonable to be good sometimes and bad at other times. But God has given us a life-law; it remains the same all the time, and it never changes. Just as sin and death are a constant law that does not allow exceptions, the life that the Lord has given us is also a constant law that does not allow exceptions. There is a law of life, not just a life. This is why we can release our grip. Because we have seen that this is a law, we can release our grip. Because we have seen that there is a treasure laid in us, no glory goes to us; all glory goes to the Lord who raises the dead. If we have seen this, we will praise God. Brothers and sisters, if we live by another law, a new law, we will experience a wonderful thing&mdash;we will not feel the existence of the old law anymore. Remember the words of the Scripture which say, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." It does not say that the law of sin and of death has been annihilated or abolished; rather, it says that we are freed from it. The law of sin and of death still exists, but we are no longer living under its power. We are living under another law.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if you want to know what the law of life is, simply lift up your eyes and look at the birds in the air. How do they fly? They fly because their life has a law of flying. They have a life, and in their life there is a law. This law enables them to fly. Their life has a law which enables them to overcome the force of gravity and fly in the air. If there is a heavy snowfall one day and a crow or sparrow falls dead in your courtyard, you will see how great the force of gravity is. Gravity draws it to the earth. The force of gravity is always present. The bird has life, and this life has a law which overcomes the force of gravity and enables it to fly in the air. When the life is gone, the law of life is also gone, and the law of gravity overcomes it. Thank the Lord! God has indeed given us grace and dispensed a new life as well as a new law to us. This renders the law of sin and of death of none effect. It is not destroyed; but it is rendered of none effect. God did not eradicate the force of "gravity"; rather, He gave us another law of life, so that the "birds" can now overcome the law of "gravity." We know that when we are strong physically, we do not feel the law of gravity. We only feel the law of gravity when we are weak. When we are weak, even walking, standing, or sitting makes us tired. We are relieved only when we lie down. Those who are the weakest feel the force of gravity the most. Thank God, our life is still with us today. This is why we do not feel the force of gravity so much. Someday when our life is nearing its end, the force of gravity will become stronger for us. If you have ever had to lift a corpse, you know how great the force of gravity is. You cannot make a corpse stand up straight; once you let go, the corpse will fall.</p><p>Some have been Christians for twenty or thirty years, yet they still do not know that sin and death are a law and that life is also a law. You need to know that God's way of salvation has nothing to do with resolving to be someone you are not. There is a life in you that delivers you from the law of sin and of death. God has no intention that you will, hope, desire, or purpose to be a certain kind of Christian. If you try to do it by your own will, it will seem as if you are hung up in midair; the endeavor will be quite strenuous. If you have ever seen a talkative Christian, you know how difficult it is for him to try to talk less. He knows that he should not speak so much, yet he cannot refrain from speaking. It is very difficult for him to stop speaking. Have you ever seen a quick-tempered Christian? It is really hard to ask him to be patient. If he tries to practice patience, sooner or later he will become sick from repression. But thank God! The way of salvation is not to be someone you are not; rather, it is living out a new law of life from within. When this law is lived out from within, sin will appear to be nonexistent and annihilated, and the power of death will seemingly disappear. If you are healthy, you will not feel the force of gravity when you are walking. You can lift up your feet because there is a greater power in you. This is the meaning of the law of life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OPERATION OF THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>On the practical side, we need to learn to know how the law of the Spirit of life operates within us. The Lord uses the law of the Spirit of life to deliver us from the law of sin and of death. He uses one law to overcome another law, and He uses today's law to overcome yesterday's law. How does this law manifest itself in a Christian? How can we detect the law of the Spirit of life in a Christian? We can examine several aspects.</p><p>We can consider first the aspect of knowledge. The law of the Spirit of life will manifest itself in God's children in the way of knowledge. There should not be any ignorant Christians. All Christians (referring to genuine Christians) should have proper knowledge. Whatever we encounter, the Spirit of life in us will give us knowledge concerning it. No Christian can say that he does not know. Every Christian has to admit that the Lord has spoken already. At the most we can say that we have not heard the Lord's speaking; however, we cannot say that the Lord has not spoken. Can we really say that we do not know the Lord's mind? Can we say that we do not know whether or not we can do a certain thing? We can never say this. We may be a weak believer, having just believed in the Lord Jesus and just received life into us. Yet as soon as we believe in the Lord and as soon as the Spirit of life dwells in us, the law will be instructing us within. Many servants of the Lord have met many of God's children in various places, and they have all come to the conclusion that there is not a child of God who does not know His will. There are no ignorant children; there are only disobedient children. When we talk too much, do we not feel something restraining us within? Sometimes when we open our mouth to speak certain things, is there not something within telling us to stop? Do we not have a feeling that we should stop? Brothers and sisters, this life is in us, and it is always manifested through its law.</p><p>It is strange that some of God's children think that they have received the life of God but have not received the law of this life. It would be strange for a man to have life without having the law of that life. We need to realize that both the life and the law of life are linked together. Where there is life, there is also the law of life. Life is inseparable from the law of life. Where there is life, there is also the law of life. If we have God's life, whenever we need knowledge, we will find it within. This is true not only with big matters but also with very small matters, matters that we feel are insignificant. Sometimes when we go to someone's house, our steps may be a little too heavy as we are walking up the stairs. A voice within may say, "This is not right." Walking up stairs is not a big thing, but when the sound of our footsteps becomes a little too heavy, our inner being will tell us that this is not right. Sometimes we want to take a book from someone else's bookshelf and read it, but inwardly a voice says, "This is not right because the book does not belong to you. You have not asked, and you have not been given permission. How can you take it and read it?" Brothers and sisters, the law of life is in us; indeed, it is in us. The problem is that many are not willing to walk according to this law. If a person lives by this life, his feeling will become very sensitive. We have a law within, and this law will tell us that we cannot trespass against others. It will tell us that we cannot be so loud, that our laughter is not proper, or that our motive in saying a word is wrong. We may encounter tens of thousands of things, but the law within will tell us what we should do in each case. Even if a person is not refined or educated, the law of life will be in him as long as he has the Lord's life. The law of life will give him knowledge, and through this knowledge he will express God in his living.</p><p>Why do some Christians always stand in the wrong place and remain unaware of it? Why do some of them always do wrong things and remain ignorant of them? It is not because they do not have life or the law of life, but because they have not learned to follow the law of life within.</p><p>This law also manifests itself in love. Sometimes you feel that a certain brother is really troublesome and that you cannot settle things with him. You need to exert much effort to love him. You may say, "I will love him; I intend to love him. I will pray to the Lord to enable me to love him." But when you are with him, you simply cannot love him. It seems as if you can only nod at him. You may think, "I am a Christian, and I must speak a few words with him or else my conscience will not be at peace." Please remember that this is an act of your will. You are doing it by your will; you are not doing it out of love. If you are a Christian, you do not need to will to love others. Many times even prayer is not necessary, because there is a law within you. When you see such a brother, you know that you can never get along with him, you know that he is very troublesome, and you know that his very presence will irritate you. However, when you stand in front of him, you will spontaneously feel that it is wrong to hate him. Your inward being will not say "amen" to hating him. Instead, something within will love him and tell you, "He belongs to the Lord; he is your brother; he is the Lord's beloved." There is such a feeling within you. There is such a speaking within you. Brothers and sisters, when you are in this kind of situation, you do not need to do anything before the Lord; you do not even need to pray. All you have to do is lift up your head and say to the Lord, "I cannot do it! You can do it." You do not need to exert any effort. You only need to say, "Lord, since You say that he is lovable, I will love him."</p><p>The biggest failure of many Christians at this point is exercising their will. When you feel that a brother is not lovable, you hastily exercise your will to treat him well. Whenever you have a problem, you exercise your will immediately to try to solve this problem. When you meet a person whom you cannot love, you immediately force yourself to love him. Yet in spite of your great effort, you still cannot love him. At such times, you should stop and say to the Lord, "I do not have any strength to love him. Lord, I know that there is a life in me, and this life loves him." Simply remain in His presence. There is no need to think or ask. All you have to do is say, "Lord, I want to live fully by the law of life." You do not need to exert any effort at all, because you believe that there is a law within you, a law that loves the brothers. This gives you the boldness to see him and talk to him. The strange thing is that when you do this, you will unconsciously (note the word unconsciously) converse with him. You will unconsciously love him and unconsciously treat him like a brother. You will talk with him and fellowship with him. Later, even you will be surprised, saying, "I did not do anything. Yet the Lord brought me through beyond my comprehension." Brothers and sisters, this is the law of life; it enables you to unconsciously overcome, without any need of your willpower.</p><p>If we know God, we will realize that the law of the Spirit of life, like the law of sin and of death, is spontaneous. Hallelujah! It is spontaneous. Sinning requires no exercise of the will; the law of sin does it for us. Neither do we need to set our will to do good; it is the law of the Spirit of life that does it for us. Lying, coveting, and losing one's temper require no exercise of the will. There is a law that causes one to lie, covet, and lose his temper. Holiness, righteousness, love, and purity also require no effort of the will; there is a law in us that produces all of these things. The exercise of the will is man's work, not the Lord's work. Herein lies the basic difference. The Lord has given us a law, and this law is spontaneous.</p><p>Many times you realize that you talk too much, speaking words that should not be spoken. You even feel sick and do not understand why you always talk so much. In the course of contact with other people, you worry and say, "I am a Christian. I need to glorify the Lord's name. I should not talk so much." Then what do you do? You exercise your will, and make resolutions, saying, "Today I will be careful not to speak too much." You hold yourself back for an hour or two. You feel no freedom at all, and the longer you hold back, the more unbearable it becomes. You utter countless prayers, saying, "Lord, I should not be talkative. If I continue to be talkative, I will not behave like a Christian. Lord! Have mercy on me. Please protect me! Please watch over me!" However, your will is useless when it comes to controlling your speaking. The Lord lives in you, and the Lord's life is in you. This life has a law, and when this law is manifested in you, there is no need to worry at all. You can say to the Lord, "I am going to So-and-so's house. I will no longer make any resolution. I cannot control my mouth. I know what kind of person I am; I know that I talk too much. But Lord, I believe; I deeply believe that the law of the Spirit of life which You have given me has freed me and delivered me from that law of talking too much." This does not mean that when you go to that house you must continue to consciously say, "I believe the Lord's Word." If you do, you are exercising your will once again. If you really believe, you will forget it, set it aside, and go in a spontaneous way without even thinking about it. The strange thing is that when you do not exercise your will to hold yourself back and when you believe in the Lord's Word, you will not need to make any resolution, worry, or even think about it. Even when the thought of talking too much comes to your mind, it will not bother you any longer. You will be able to sit for two or three hours or even stay for two or three days without feeling troubled. When you come home and think about it, you will say, "I was not concerned and not paying attention to the matter. I did not have to consciously keep myself from talking too much. Why did I not talk so much?" Brothers and sisters, this is the operation of the law of life; it frees you from your incessant talking. This is the Christian life. It is not the work of the will; it is a law. This law is a life; it is spontaneous. The Christian life is a spontaneous life. The law of life in you, like the law of sin and of death, is a law. Just as the law of sin and of death is a very spontaneous law, the law of life that you have received is spontaneous as well.</p><p>O brothers and sisters, we can say much more about this matter. We can relate innumerable experiences to prove this point. Our victory is not a victory of the will but a victory of the law of life. When we need knowledge, there is a law in us that continually gives us knowledge of what is right and wrong. When we are faced with a task, there is strength within us which carries us through in a very spontaneous way. In all of our living, we see the effects of this law. Many Christians live in too much pretension and performance. Many Christians "act out" their Christian life. Their daily life is nothing but a performance. Oh, the moment we see the law of life, the first thing we will do is drop our own work! Many people use spiritual terms and adopt spiritual behavior, yet they are the ones who are doing these things. Once a person sees the law of life, the first thing he will do is drop his own work. Performance is the most damaging thing to the Christian life. Many Christians who perform think that the better they perform, the better Christian they will be. The outward expressions of spirituality of many Christians are artificial; they are the work of the will. When we see the law of the Spirit of life, we will cease all of our outward performance. All of our expressions will be spontaneous; all of our words will be spontaneous; all of our prayers and our living will be spontaneous. With this law in us, how spontaneous our living will be! We will not need to expend any effort; our will will not be required to purpose anything; we will live very spontaneously. After going through a day this way, we will say when we lie down at night, "Today I did not try to be a Christian, yet I lived as a Christian. Today I did not try to do anything, yet the Lord brought me through." Brothers and sisters, when you put aside your will, you will not be any worse than you are today. When you throw aside the crutch of your will, you will not fall. On the contrary, you will become very spontaneous. Formerly, you prayed and asked for this or that from the Lord, just as Jacob did when he wrestled with God. But when you walk before God, you will see that you have become a soft person in His hand. You will not have to pretend to be soft; you are soft already. You will live a simple Christian life, yet throughout your life the Lord's name will be glorified. The Lord has given you life. It is a life that operates in you, a life that speaks in you. There is no need for your own striving or working.</p><p>In conclusion, let us return to Romans 8:1-2: "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." God uses the first law to deliver us from the second law; God uses a new law to save us from the old law. I would like to ask you a few questions. How much do you know of this new law? Is your Christian life governed by your will or by the manifestation of this new law in you? Are you living your Christian life, or is there a spontaneous law, a spontaneous power of life in you that directs you to live the Christian life in a spontaneous way? Brothers and sisters, you can boast about your knowledge; you can boast about your power; you can boast about your work; you can boast about your sacrifice; and you can boast about your intelligence. You can be proud of all these things, but if you do not have this law, you have nothing to be proud of, because you have not learned the first lesson of the Christian life. The first lesson in the Christian life is that the Christian life is very spontaneous. The life in Romans 8 does not require any effort; everything is spontaneous in this life. Oh, may the Lord grant us grace so that we may truly say to Him, "I am willing to live in Your presence. I believe Your Word. I believe that I received the law of life when I was born again. This law is greater than the law of sin and of death. With the law of sin and of death, I sin spontaneously. With this law, I trust You spontaneously, serve You spontaneously, and glorify and praise Your name spontaneously!"</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">GOD SPEAKING<br />THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 35:1-8; 34:30</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>No matter how much spiritual advancement a man has achieved, he often needs the speaking from the environment. This kind of speaking can be found in the Old Testament as well as in the New Testament. In reading church history and in considering the experience of the Lord's followers, we do not know of one person who did not need the speaking of the environment at all. Everyone needs the environment to remind him and speak to him. Many examples point to the fact that the more spiritual a person is in the eyes of the Lord, the more he allows his environment to speak to him, and the deeper a person is in following the Lord, the more he allows his environment to remind him and speak to him. Those who have problems with the Lord are either easily affected by the environment or insensitive to God's speaking through the environment. Brothers and sisters, the precious thing about a man who has normal fellowship with God is that he will not be influenced by the environment, yet at the same time, he will allow the environment to speak to him. If a man is not proper with the Lord and if he is not in fellowship with the Lord, a very small thing in the environment will affect him; however, at the same time, even a great thing in the environment will not cause his ear to be attuned to the Lord's voice or speaking. I present this principle, and you can test yourself accordingly. If you can be affected by your environment yet not hear its speaking, it proves that you are no longer in fellowship with the Lord and that you have become fallen. No environment should affect you, yet every environment should speak to you.</p><p>If an environment is placed before us, there is a speaking behind it. Whenever God puts an environment around us, He is speaking to us through the environment. Hidden within the environment is God's speaking to us. When I say "us," I mean every one of us. The environment that we face every day has a word for each of us Christians. Brothers and sisters, if we are living under God's light, we will see that He puts us in an environment for His way's sake on earth. In order to gain something from His children, God puts them in an environment. We should not consider things in a superficial way; we have to see the Lord's hand behind the veil. Once we see that the Lord is arranging the environment, we will be filled with a sense of sweetness. Although we cannot say that every environment is initiated by the throne, we can say that each one is according to the design of the throne. There is a throne in heaven, and our Lord resurrected and ascended to sit on that throne; all things are under His feet. God speaks to His children through the environment He has arranged. We should receive His speaking through the environment. If we are affected by the environment but not taught by it, we have a problem with the Lord; there is something wrong between us and Him.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Let us consider the story of Jacob. Everyone agrees that the most profound experience in Jacob's life was his wrestling with the Lord at Peniel. As a result of that wrestling, his name was changed. Even though Jacob went through a profound experience at Peniel, God still had to raise up circumstances when He spoke to him again. In Genesis 34 Jacob's daughter suffered a tragedy, and his sons caused a great deal of trouble. When such an environment arose, God spoke to Jacob in Genesis 35. Some may argue that God spoke to Jacob directly in Genesis 35 rather than speaking to him through the environment. Yet one must first read Genesis 34. God first put Jacob into the environment of chapter thirty-four before He spoke to him in chapter thirty-five. God said, "Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother" (v. 1). Brothers and sisters, God reminded Jacob of an old story. Many years earlier Jacob had run away to his uncle Laban's home out of fear that his brother Esau would kill him. When he reached Bethel the sun had set. He lodged there and fell asleep on a rock. God appeared to him in his dream, and when he awoke, he vowed, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee" (28:20-22). He made a vow to the Lord.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, did you not make a vow to the Lord when you were saved? Although you may have vowed like Jacob, bargaining with God while you vowed, your heart was still proper. When you began on this path, your heart toward the Lord was proper. Jacob made a vow to the Lord. His condition is a picture of our condition. The morning after Jacob made his vow, he left everything behind. During the entire time he stayed in the east, he maneuvered to protect himself. Although he prayed that God would protect him and give him food and raiment, he trusted in himself the whole time. He is a perfect reflection of us. He looked to God, yet he also exercised his own maneuvering hand. When he left Laban, he had to bow his head and acknowledge God's mercy on him. If it had been left to Jacob, he could not have prevailed over Laban! Jacob was crafty, but God had prepared Laban who was craftier. Jacob was dealt with for twenty years. Finally God took him out of Laban's hand, and Jacob had to acknowledge God's care. However, he had forgotten his earlier vow to the Lord. When he came back from Padan-aram, he settled in Shechem.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, you may think that Jacob should have been able to settle comfortably in Shechem since he had suffered so many dealings, passed through so many experiences, endured so many hardships, and acquired so many possessions. But this was not the case. The God whom he served would not allow him to settle down in peace. Jacob's heart was satisfied, but God's heart was not satisfied. God had given Jacob what he desired, but Jacob had not given God what He deserved. God still had to speak to him; He still had to speak to him through his environment. God knew that unless He dealt with Jacob through his environment, he would not be able to hear His voice.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, do not think that your spiritual experience is so deep that you can go by the inner voice alone. No, God often has to speak through the environment. You may encounter great things or small things, and they may have a little impact or a severe impact on you, but God has to raise up environments in order to speak to you. No one can be so spiritual that he no longer needs the speaking of the environment. God must create an environment around a believer and speak to him through that environment. Jacob was spiritual after Peniel. He was no longer Jacob; he had become Israel. He had passed through many trials and dealings and had even been touched by God in a thorough way. He was truly spiritual. Yet even after arriving at such a state, God had to raise up the environment to speak to him. He wanted to settle down in Shechem, but God would not allow it. The Bible does not say whether or not he realized this within himself. He may have seen something, but it did not remain in him for a long time. We have no idea whether he was conscious of his condition. We only know that God raised up the environment to speak to Jacob. What was the circumstance? His daughter suffered a tragedy, his sons caused him a great deal of trouble, and he was no longer able to keep his peace. When confronted with these circumstances, Jacob did not realize that God was trying to speak through the environment. He put the blame on his sons and became afraid. At this juncture God spoke to him: "Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."</p><p>Brothers and sisters, the environment which Jacob encountered prepared him to receive God's speaking. Jacob thought that he had everything he needed and that he could live in peace. But God raised up the environment so that he could no longer be peacefully settled. God was saying, "I have given you what you asked for at the beginning. Now you should honor your vow." God raised up this environment. He spoke to Jacob through the environment. After Jacob heard this speaking, he offered himself and his household to the Lord once more and cleansed himself and his household.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, when God shook up Jacob, what was found? Idols were found in Jacob's house! Such a spiritual person, one who knew God very much, had not only forgotten his vow, but also had hidden idols in his house! We still have idols hidden in us, and the inner voice is not enough to shake them out. It takes outward circumstances to shake them out! Brothers and sisters, in order to return to Bethel, all these things must be surrendered! If you ignore your first vow and allow these things to remain in your house while claiming to obey the inner leading and inner voice, God will raise up circumstances that will shake you so that the idols in your house will be shaken out. He can even shake out the golden earrings and other improper objects in your house. In our fellowship with the Lord, we often are not sensitive to His rebukes and our mistakes. God has to raise up an environment to shake us up. Then we will realize that there are still hidden idols that we have not yet given up. We should not trust ourselves and say, "As long as I have the peace within, I am all right." We do need to inwardly hearken to the inner voice, but brothers and sisters, we must realize how deeply we have fallen, how difficult it is for us to stand, and how easy it is for us to fall. At times our inner feelings are not that sensitive, and the inner admonition is not that strong. Therefore, we still need God to speak to us through the environment. Brothers and sisters, we may have been Christians for many years. As far as our experiences are concerned, we may have made considerable progress since our first time in Bethel. But as far as our consecration goes, we may have lost our initial consecration at Bethel. God is happy to see that we have some experiences and to work Himself into us through these experiences, but He is even happier to see us sustaining our initial fresh consecration. Brothers and sisters, no matter how mature you are, you still have to return to Bethel. From Jacob's experience, we can see that God had worked much into him, and much of His element had been deposited into him. Yet Jacob had lost his initial vow of consecration. This is why God had to speak to him through the environment. Jacob was already very spiritual, yet God still had to speak to him through the environment.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, it is not enough to just have the inner voice. Sometimes we still need the speaking of the outward environment. We may want to settle down comfortably in Shechem, but God will raise up the environment so that we cannot settle down comfortably. He wants us to fulfill our first consecration; He wants us to return to Bethel. We may have forgotten our vow, but God has not forgotten it. We may not have honored our consecration, but God honors it. Brothers and sisters, consecration exposes our shortcomings. Whenever we turn back to our initial consecration, we find many unnecessary things within us, and we find that we have backslidden. Brothers and sisters, we should not think that we are that spiritual and that we have no problems at all. Go and pray, perhaps saying, "Lord, seven years ago I was revived for the first time. I prayed that night and consecrated everything on the altar; I offered up everything to you. Today I will offer up everything to you again." Once we return to our first vow, we will find that we have many unnecessary things. We will realize that we have fallen away from our initial consecration. We may be more experienced than before and we may boast that we know God more and that we are more mature, but when we turn back to our initial consecration, we will see we have fallen and that we have idols and golden earrings in spite of our maturity. There are many things that need to be buried. We need to bury the idols and the earrings under the oak tree in Shechem before we can return to Bethel to serve the Lord. Brothers and sisters, Jacob was mature, yet he did not return to Bethel until God raised up the environment and spoke to him.</p><p>We should consider whether God's voice is in our environment calling us back to Bethel. We have come to where we are, and all our needs have been met. We would like to settle down, but will God let us settle down? We have our rest, but does God have His rest? Has He gained what we vowed to Him at Bethel? God has to raise up the environment to turn some brothers and sisters back to Bethel, that is, to their first vow. If we have given up our first vow, God will order an environment to stir us up, to make us restless, and to speak to our inner being. The environment that God has ordered for us will not affect us without also speaking something to us. Brothers and sisters, even a man as spiritual as Jacob could not hear God's speaking except through the environment. We should never presume that everything is fine as long as we feel peaceful inside. Sometimes our feelings of peace are a kind of self-deception. We may say that our heart is at peace, but have we received more of the Lord's correction recently? Have we been reminded by Him? How much has God gained in us? How much has He stripped from us? Brothers and sisters, we must remember that we should have the Lord's speaking in our environment. We should hear God's voice through the environment and return to Bethel, to our initial vow of consecration so that God can be satisfied.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">PRAYING ACCORDING TO GOD'S DESIRE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:14; Psa. 119:147-148; Dan. 9</h1><p>In Daniel 9 we should pay attention to two things concerning Daniel's prayer. First, a genuine man of prayer is not only one who comes before God continually but also one whose desires are fully blended into God's desires. In other words, his thoughts are fully one with God's thoughts. This is a very important principle in prayer.</p><p>Some prayers originate from our needs. Sometimes God answers these prayers, but He does not gain anything through these prayers. Psalm 106:15 says, "And He gave them their request,/But He sent leanness into their soul." What does this mean? This means that in the wilderness the Israelites prayed to God for the satisfaction of their lust, and God answered their prayer. He gave them what they wanted, yet they became weak before His eyes. Brothers and sisters, sometimes God answers our prayers to satisfy our needs. Yet these prayers do not satisfy God's desire. These prayers are of little worth.</p><p>There is another kind of prayer&mdash;one that originates from God's needs. It comes from God and is initiated by God. This kind of prayer is valuable. Those who have this kind of prayer must be in God's presence continually, and their desires and thoughts must be mingled with God's desires and thoughts. Because these ones live in God's presence continually, He shows them and touches them with His desires and thoughts. These desires and thoughts become the praying ones' desires, which in turn become their prayer.</p><p>We must learn to pray this kind of prayer. Although we are childish and weak, we must still come into His presence and allow His Spirit to mingle our desires with His desires and to lead our thoughts into His thoughts so that we can touch and participate in His desires and thoughts. If we do this, we will understand something of God's way and demands on man. Brothers and sisters, the more we enter into God's desires and thoughts, the more we will understand these desires and thoughts. Eventually, His desire will become our prayer. These prayers are precious. Daniel joined himself to God's thoughts; he touched God's desire and will, and they became the desires of Daniel's heart. God's desires were imprinted in Daniel and became Daniel's desires. When Daniel prayed according to these desires, crying out or groaning because of these desires, they became God's desires. We must have this kind of prayer, a prayer that touches God's heart. More words are not needed, only more of a touching of His desires is needed. We should allow God's Spirit to lead us into His heart. We should spend time to learn this lesson. When we first begin to pray in this way, there is no need to say or consider much. Our heart should be calm and undisturbed. We can bring the things we have encountered into God's presence and consider them, or we can forget about these things and simply meditate on God's Word. We can remain in His presence, touching God in our spirit and allowing God to touch us in the spirit. Actually, we do not have to go to God to touch Him; we can simply wait on Him. While we wait on Him in this way, something will come to our attention, and we will gain something. Then we will touch God's desire. The greatest wisdom comes from this kind of waiting. In this way our desires are mingled with God's desires, and our thoughts are one with God's thoughts. Based on this, we can pray to God.</p><p>When we bring our desires and thoughts to God, He will imprint His desires and thoughts into us to the extent that they become our desires and thoughts. These prayers are the most precious of all prayers; they are the most weighty prayers. Brothers and sisters, we have to remember the Lord's Word, which tells us to pray this way: "Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth" (Matt. 6:9-10). We should not just memorize these three sentences. They should afford God's Spirit the opportunity to bring our thoughts to God so that His desires and thoughts can be imprinted in us and become our desires and thoughts. When that happens, the prayers that we utter will be valuable.</p><p>The same thing can result in two different kinds of prayers. One kind of prayer originates from our own desire; we pray according to our own concepts and wishes. God may answer these prayers, but there is very little value to these prayers. However, if we bring this matter to the Lord and His Spirit mingles our desire with His desire, leads our thoughts into His thoughts, and imprints His desires and thoughts into us, we will find ourselves having intense desires and thoughts. If God is grieved and sorrowful over man's condition of death, the same grief and sorrow will be imprinted in us, and we will have a desire to see man delivered from death. There will be a groaning within that will be turned into prayer. If God is grieved and anxious over His children's failures and this is imprinted in us, we will also have a desire to see that none of His children fall into sin or darkness. We will utter such prayers and supplications from within; we will confess our sins and ask for His forgiveness and cleansing of His children. One kind of prayer issues from man's own will, while another kind of prayer is based on the desire which comes as a result of the imprint of God's desire. These two kinds of prayers are different. Brothers and sisters, when we come to God and His desires are imprinted in us, these desires will become our breath and groaning. Prayers that are precious and weighty are those that are based on inward desires.</p><p>God has much work to do on earth; there are many things He wants to accomplish. We cannot pray according to our own feelings or thoughts; rather, we should come before His presence and draw near to Him and look to Him. We should allow Him to imprint us with the things that He wants to do on earth and turn them into our groaning. When we draw near to God, He may imprint the desire in us to preach the gospel. We will have a desire within to preach the gospel, and this desire will become a burden. When we pray according to this burden, there will be nothing but this burden in our groaning. Brothers and sisters, when we draw near to God in this way, He may reveal more of His desires, and more will be imprinted in us. When God imprints His desires into a person, he will turn God's desires into his own and pray accordingly. When Daniel went to the Lord, he touched something. When he prayed and groaned for what he had touched, the prayer became precious and weighty. It became something that sanctified God's name, something that brought in His kingdom, and something that enabled His will to be done on earth.</p><p>Second, we should also realize that this kind of prayer will shake the seat of Hades and affect Satan. Hence, he will frustrate such prayers. Any prayer that comes from God will inevitably touch the power of darkness. This will bring in the spiritual warfare. Our bodies, families, and everything around us will come under Satan's attack. Whenever we pray this way, we will become vulnerable to Satan's attacks. He will attack until we cannot go on in our prayer. He will even try to stop us by nullifying our prayers and delaying their answers. A prayer may deserve immediate answer, yet it may still hang in the air. God answered Daniel's prayer, but Satan hindered the answer to his prayer for twenty-one days. Daniel went down on his knees and waited until the answer to his prayer arrived. Brothers and sisters, have you ever wondered why your prayers have not been answered quickly? Perhaps it has been less than twenty-one days since you prayed! Perhaps the throne has answered your prayer, but the answer is hindered and still in the air; there is the need for prayer on earth, the need for men to endure in the presence of the Lord, and the need for some to go down on their knees.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if we come to God and remain calm before Him, giving up our thoughts to enter into His thoughts, we will see the great need for prayer, we will see that God is waiting for us to pray about so many things, and we will see that everything around can become the subject of our prayer. In fact the whole earth can become the subject of our prayer. We should not pray according to our feelings. We must mingle our desires with God's desires and allow God's desires to become our desires, groanings, and yearnings for the universe. God's desires cannot be released without first passing through man, and God's desires, when expressed through man's desires, will be opposed by the power of Satan. In order to fulfill God's desire, we have to pray, and in order to remove Satan's frustration, we have to pray. We have to exercise the authority of prayer and release what should be released and bind what should be bound. We should not pray according to our own desire; we should go to the Lord and pray according to the desire that He has imprinted in us. When God says that something is needed, we should say the same, and when He says that something cannot remain, we should also say the same. We should forget about ourselves and touch God's desire and express His desire through our prayer.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY</h1><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br />CONCERNING PRAYER</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Question: Has God given us a full provision for our prayer?</p><p>Answer: Yes, God has given us a full provision in His Son through His Spirit. If we did not have a full provision from the Lord, we might withdraw from our privilege and duty to pray. Thank the Lord that He has fulfilled all of the requirements for drawing near to Him and living before Him. We can sum up the Lord's provision with two words: trust and help.</p><p>First, let us consider trust. Trusting means committing and having the boldness to depend with full assurance. Many things are included in this word. A trusting spirit is very crucial to prayer and the Christian life as a whole. If we waver before the Lord, and if we lack assurance and trust in Him, our life will suffer a fatal blow. Let us pay attention to a few portions of the Word:</p><p>Hebrews 10:19-22 says, "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh, and having a great Priest over the house of God, let us come forward to the Holy of Holies with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water."</p><p>Romans 5:2 says, "Through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God."</p><p>Ephesians 2:18 says, "For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father."</p><p>Ephesians 3:12 says, "In whom we have boldness and access in confidence through faith in Him." We do not come to God according to our worthiness. Christ holds our hand and leads us to God. It is the Lord Himself who recommends to God those who are washed by the blood and who are alive from the dead. We put Him on as our robe of righteousness. Hence, our trust is in Christ Himself.</p><p>True faith is based on one thing&mdash;Christ Himself. We have an absolute right to come to God. He Himself is our right to come to God. This is His provision. We can come to the Father at any time in His name. We do not have to come to the Father according to our condition or in our own name (this is impossible in any case). We come to the Father in the name of the Son.</p><p>Second, let us consider help. Blessed are those who come to God through trusting in the Lord! However, even though we have such a tremendous privilege, we may feel impotent, weak, foolish, and unable to pray. It is marvelous to have help from the Spirit.</p><p>Romans 8:26-27 says, "Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. But He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to God." Our weaknesses are most readily manifested in our prayers. Nothing exposes our spiritual weakness more than prayer. We know how difficult it was for the disciples to pray in the garden of Gethsemane; they could not watch and pray. But thank the Lord that we have the mighty Spirit as our help. We must trust in the indwelling Spirit to operate in us according to His power, because He is our help in our time of weakness and foolishness. Although we do not know how to pray, the Holy Spirit is in us; He knows the will of God and He will teach us to pray according to God's will. He will teach us to fellowship with God intelligently and bring us into the reality of fellowship. We should trust in the Christ in whom we believe and the Spirit who sustains us and helps us pray.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Question: Why is Satan doing everything he can to frustrate our prayers?</p><p>Answer: Satan will do anything that he can to cut off our fellowship with heaven. Consequently, he will pay any price to frustrate genuine prayer. We must be on the alert. He constantly attacks the prayers of the believers and the prayers of the church. He knows that once he prevails in his attack on prayers, he can rest in peace. Therefore, we must be watchful and on guard against Satan, particularly when we pray. We have to pay attention to several things when we deal with Satan's attacks:</p><p>(1) Satan will attack our faith in the Lord. He knows that as long as he can make us feel unworthy, weak, and lacking in faith towards the Lord, we will lose our heart to pray.</p><p>(2) Sometimes he attacks our body, mind, mentality, and other physical faculties. When we feel tired and enervated, we have no interest in praying. We must guard ourselves from these things. These things are surmountable. The Lord will take responsibility for the things that are beyond our power.</p><p>(3) Sometimes Satan will attack the time we have set aside for prayer, whether it is our individual prayer time or the prayer time of the church. Many people have similar experiences. Satan is very subtle in his deception. He either usurps the time of prayer, or he causes us to not pray genuine prayers. Sometimes we have the time to pray, but lack the life to pray.</p><p>(4) Sometimes Satan will frustrate us from having uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord. He will produce a barrier between us and the Lord so that we cannot contact Him. It is as if a cloud strangely appears between us and Him.</p><p>(5) Finally, Satan is determined to shut us up in darkness so that we do not see the need for prayer. He turns our focus continually to other things so that we suffer in our prayer life. We must never fall into Satan's trap. We have to look to the Lord, gather material for prayer, and pay more attention to the Lord's interest and needs. We have a great responsibility to pray. Consequently, we have to watch and pray.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Question: According to the Lord's Word, what kind of prayer should we pay attention to other than our personal prayers?</p><p>Answer: We should pay attention to corporate prayers, that is, the prayer of the church. When we talk about the prayer of the church, we do not mean that personal prayers are unimportant; we are not insensitive to the need of personal prayers. But there is a law in God's kingdom: Some things are impossible for an individual to do alone; they require a collective effort and mutual support. Mutuality is particularly necessary in the matter of prayer. Those who follow the Lord constantly realize the need for praying with other believers. Sometimes it is not enough for a person to pray alone. Particularly for matters as great as God's kingdom, the only prayer that works is one in which the whole church strives to pray. The Lord said, "My house shall be called a house of prayer" (Matt. 21:13). We can follow this with the phrase "whose house we are" (Heb. 3:6).</p><p>The Lord said, "Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens. For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst" (Matt. 18:19-20). Both fact and experience tell us that when we are gathered together in the Lord, there is more of the Lord's presence than when we are by ourselves. The Lord is in the midst of the church; He cannot be in the midst of individuals. (With individuals, there can be no "midst." The Lord can only be inside an individual. The portion of the Lord which is assigned to "in their midst" cannot be found in individuals.) When we truly are gathered together into the Lord, we will feel the broadening sphere of our prayer, and we will be much more empowered in our prayer-battle. Moreover, in our prayer meeting we can often experience the Holy Spirit revealing God's will to us, burdening us, and giving us utterance for prayer. We can, of course, say much more on the prayer of the church. But I will stop here and say only one important word: The prayer of the church cannot replace our personal prayers. At the same time, personal prayers will always come short of the prayer of the church; they are not on the same level as the prayer of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Question: What do we need to take care of in our prayer?</p><p>Answer: There are many things that we have to take care of in our prayer. Let me list them below:</p><p>(1) We must sustain a proper fellowship with the Lord in everything. We must bring everything in our daily life to the Lord because nothing in the Christian life is common or inconsequential. We should have a daily and spontaneous habit of fellowshipping with the Lord in everything (Phil. 4:6).</p><p>(2) We should petition again and again. The Lord loves to see men petitioning Him. He is a gracious Giver, and He wants man to pray. "But if any one of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and does not reproach, and it will be given to him. But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing" (James 1:5-6). "You do not have because you do not ask; you ask and do not receive because you ask evilly" (4:2b-3). Petitioning involves trust and hope. As long as the motive for our petition is pure, we can petition as much as we want.</p><p>(3) Our prayers should involve meditation and supplication, that is, going before the Lord to pray on behalf of others (Col. 4:12). Strictly speaking, this is participating in the fellowship of the Lord as the High Priest, because He is praying for His people and their needs all the time.</p><p>(4) We should persevere in prayer. The need for perseverance or earnestness in prayer does not meant that it is difficult for God to answer our prayers. Persevering in prayer means that we should clearly identify God's need before Him and persist in praying about it. If this is the case, why does not God answer us immediately? Why does He delay His answer? There are at least two reasons for this. First, God wants His people to have an adequate reaction to His deep longings and concerns. Second, certain necessities and circumstances have a need for persevering prayer. Satan has strongholds, and we have to offer up strong prayers before these strongholds can be torn down (Mark 9:28-29).</p><p>(5) We should have reigning prayers. We must be joined to the Lord on the throne (Eph. 2:6), who is the Lord over all, and we must pray according to the name which is above every name.</p><p>(6) We should have fighting prayers. We should deal with matters by exalting the victory of the cross through our prayers. The direction of our prayer should follow that of the Lord's victory (6:10-20).</p><p>(7) We should have faith in prayer. Under certain circumstances, the Holy Spirit will give men an inward assurance; they will know God's will. When this happens, their prayers will be answered immediately (Acts 9:40).</p><p>(8)We should be burdened for prayer. Prayer is like a spiritual travail for birth. It is fellowshipping with the Lord's suffering, fellowshipping with the Father's heart, and being in harmony with the Spirit's groaning until the day of glory (Gal. 4:19).</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>Question: What is the central goal of prayer?</p><p>Answer: The central goal of prayer is for God to have a glorious church. The central subject of prayer is to prepare a glorious church for Christ, a church that will match Him. This is the revelation of the whole Bible and God's central goal, and we must pay special attention to it. This is also the Lord's desire. Before He was crucified, His prayer revealed this desire (John 17). At the same time, we can see the same desire in Paul's Epistles. This does not mean that we should pray less for other things; it merely shows us the central goal of all our prayers. Once we have this goal in us, we can raise other prayers to a higher level. If we see that the gospel not only brings men out of death and into life but also joins men in an unspeakably wonderful union with the glorious Christ, our prayer for the world will only increase; it will not decrease. Carrying this one step further, there is a great need today for the world to see the glory of Christ through the church. The church, through the Spirit, should convince the world that it is the channel through which blessing is brought to the world.</p><p>Finally, God wants us to enter into a more intelligent and deeper fellowship with Him. He wants us as His many sons to come to Him through His beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. He wants many priests to accompany the High Priest, who is living forever to intercede for us, and to bear the work of supplication before Him. "And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father" (Rev. 1:6). "But you are...a royal priesthood" (1 Pet. 2:9).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">MEASURE AND FLOW</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 7:37-38; Ezek. 47:1-10, 12</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>In the Bible water is a very important matter and has a great significance. In Genesis 2, after creating man, God put him in the garden of Eden, which was watered by a river. In this chapter we see water, and as we read further, the Bible often mentions water or a river. According to Psalm 36:8, God's people "are saturated with the fatness of Your house,/And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures." The prophets frequently referred to water; Ezekiel 47 vividly depicts water flowing out and becoming a river. In the Gospels, especially the Gospel of John which deals with life, the Lord Jesus referred to water many times. He said, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" (4:14). He also said, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" (7:37-38). The last chapter of the Bible, Revelation 22, indicates that there is a pure river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the New Jerusalem (v. 1). In these passages, the Bible uses water as a symbol of the life of God. When we receive the life of the Lord, it enters into us and becomes as if it were a spring of water connected to our being. Once we receive the life of the Lord, we are joined to the fountain of life. According to John 7:37-38, when the water comes into us, it becomes rivers of living water flowing out from us. Now we need to consider the following question: How can the life within us flow out like a river of living water?</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>The word flow is in John 7, and the synonyms issued or ran out are in Ezekiel 47. Both John and Ezekiel said that the water would become a river. If we compare Ezekiel's word with John's, we will see how the water flowed out. It flowed out by measuring. In Ezekiel we see that after measuring, the waters came to the ankles; after measuring again, they came to the knees; after measuring once again, they came to the loins; after measuring the fourth time, they became waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over. From this we should notice one thing. In order for the water in John 7 to flow out like a river, there must be the measuring spoken of in Ezekiel 47. By putting the two passages together we can see that the secret for the living water to flow out is measuring.</p><p>What is the meaning of measuring? According to Ezekiel, it means the separation of the holy from the common. The man whom Ezekiel saw in the vision measured several times. Ezekiel 42:20 says, "He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place." The measuring in this verse discriminates between the sanctified and the profane; it separates the sanctified from the profane. After measuring a piece of land, it is regarded as a sanctified, no longer profane, place and it is consecrated to God. God wants us to be consecrated to Him. This is why He measures us. Any part in us that is measured is no longer profane; it is sanctified. What was once worldly becomes godly after it is measured.</p><p>While communing with God, Ezekiel saw the measurer in a vision. His appearance was like the appearance of brass (Ezek. 40:1-3). When the Bible speaks of man meeting God or His angel, it often mentions the appearance. For instance, Revelation 4 says that John saw God sitting on the throne and that He looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. The measurer whom Ezekiel saw had the appearance of brass. The significance of brass in the Bible is judgment. The altar, which was made of brass, represented judgment. The bronze serpent prefigured the Lord Jesus undergoing judgment on the cross on behalf of man. The measurer had the appearance of brass; this signifies that he was a judge. At the time of measuring, there is separation as well as judgment. There must be a definite standard, or a definite scale, in order to measure. Sloppy people cannot measure; neither can those who are unable to differentiate between good and evil. Likewise, those who are ignorant of the measuring scale cannot measure. When we are in fellowship with God and are enlightened by Him, we will come face to face with the measurer. When God measures us, light shines on the areas where we have fallen short of His standard or His delight. This is God's judgment.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Ezekiel 47 says that the water flowed out from under the threshold of the house. After the first measuring, the water reached the depth of the ankles; when it was measured again, it was deeper; after the third measuring, it was deeper still; and after the fourth measuring, it became a river. What is the temple? It is our human spirit. Our spirit becomes the temple, and God's Spirit dwells in our spirit so that the water of life flows out from our spirit. How can the water flow out and become deeper and deeper as it flows on? The secret is in the measuring.</p><p>For instance, after you were saved, perhaps you knelt down by your bed to pray one morning; you came before God and touched Him. At that time it seemed as if someone descended from heaven to judge your lips and tongue, saying, "Your lips are so filthy, and your tongue is so sharp." Your lips and tongue were judged by God. When God's light judged you, you reproved and judged yourself, saying, "My lips are indeed filthy, and my tongue is indeed sharp." This is the same as what happened in Isaiah 6:5 when Isaiah met God in a vision and said, "Woe is me, for I am finished!/For I am a man of unclean lips,/And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell;/Yet I have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts, with my eyes." You met God, and your lips and tongue were judged. Then you went on to pray, "Lord, my lips are filthy. Cleanse me with Your blood so that my lips and tongue will be consecrated to You and placed at Your disposal from now on." From that point on, your lips and tongue were separated. If you utter frivolous or sharp words, you will feel uneasy inside. You can no longer speak so freely, because your lips and tongue have been consecrated to God.</p><p>Wherever there is judgment and measuring, there is the outflow of the water of life. Often you are powerless in preaching the gospel because your lips and tongue have not been measured; consequently, the water of life cannot flow out from your lips and tongue. When you are enlightened, judged, and measured by God, the water of life will flow out from you. Just one measurement, however, is not adequate; God will measure you two, three, and many times. God measures your lips and tongue first, and then He may measure your clothing and adornments. After you are measured by God, others will sense that even your hair and clothing are dripping with the water of life. Your clothing will satisfy those who are inwardly thirsty, refresh those who are inwardly dry, and illumine those who are inwardly dark, because your clothing has been judged, measured, and sanctified by God. How much the water of life flows out depends on how much God has gained you. As God gains more of you, the water of life will flow farther and deeper. Whether or not the water will flow far or deep enough depends on how much you are measured by God.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>The water flowed out from under the threshold of the house. After you are saved, God's life is in your spirit, but it wants to flow out. When God measures you, He starts from the inside. One day as you are drawing near to God, He will touch you and judge the love within you. In His light God will enlighten you to see that your love has not been gained by Him. Even though you know God's love, your own love is still attached to people, matters, and things other than God. God will judge your love and reveal that you have not yet given Him your love. You will spontaneously confess your sin, reprove yourself, and pray, "O God, from this day on I will give my love fully unto You." After your love has been measured by God in this way, life will flow into your love.</p><p>Later, when you draw near to God, He may judge your thoughts. He will show you that your thoughts are like an unbridled wild horse and that they have not turned to God. If you have never learned to rely upon the Spirit to control your thoughts, they will be like wild horses running here and there. As God opens your eyes, you will confess your sin. Then a desire will rise in your heart, and you will say to God, "From this point forward, I consecrate my thoughts to You." After your thoughts have been measured by God in this way, life will flow into your thoughts.</p><p>Still later you will meet God again, and He will judge your will because your will has been obstinate and you have never learned to obey. Then you will confess your sin. This will subdue your will before God. You will pray, "O God, from today on, I do not want to choose what I want; instead I want to choose what You want." After your will has been measured by God in this way, life will flow into your will.</p><p>Is the measuring complete after reaching this stage? No, God still needs to measure. He will measure your body, including your feet, hands, mouth, ears, and eyes. Every part of your body is sound and useful, but none of it has been placed at God's disposal, and none of it is useful in glorifying God. Therefore, God has to measure you. Once there was a woman in her fifties. When others spoke to her about God's Word, she could not hear, but when her son and daughter-in-law whispered to each other, she could hear them perfectly. Her ears were unmeasured. Some people's eyes are very sharp in looking around, but dull when it comes to reading the Bible; their eyes can be used only on the street, but not in the Bible. Their eyes are not measured. One day when God touches such a person, He will judge his eyes. Then he will confess his sin, saying, "My eyes are full of lust, Lord. I beseech You to cleanse me with Your precious blood. Hereafter, I consecrate my eyes to You." Sometimes a certain brother glances at you. He does not need to say anything, yet life enters into you because his eyes have been judged and measured by God.</p><p>God will measure not only our soul and body but also our family, knowledge, wealth, and every other thing. Then His life will flow out abundantly from our various parts.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, if we want God's life to flow out, we have to be measured by Him. When He measures us, He starts from the inside and works to the outside step by step. According to Ezekiel, there are at least four steps in the measuring. After the first thousand cubits were measured, the waters were to the ankles. When feet are immersed in water, they cannot walk as freely as before. The feet of those who have been taken hold of by God are not so free. Many brothers and sisters prefer to walk freely by themselves; they do not want to be restricted by God's life. Therefore, they do not want to be measured by God. Once a person is measured by God, however, his feet will not be free to walk about at will. After the second measuring, the waters become deeper; walking is even more of an inconvenience. The more you are measured by God, the more you will find that it is inconvenient for you to engage in your own activities. After being measured the third time, the waters were up to the loins; the whole body was hemmed in by the water. When a Christian reaches this point, he will lose almost all of his own activities. He will be enlightened, judged, and measured by the presence of God; God will take hold of him to such a degree that he will be bound by life. Brothers and sisters, this experience is precious. When you meet such brothers and sisters, you notice that their eyes do not turn much, their words are not sharp, and their hands and feet no longer act freely. They are immersed more deeply into God's life, and God has gained more of their inward being. In the final step, the river of John 7 comes, and the water becomes so deep that a man can swim in it. At this point, one is fully carried along by the flow of the water. This is Madame Guyon's final experience&mdash;being lost in God. This is the deepest step.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, being measured is the secret to having the outflow of the water of life. While you are in communion with God, He will measure you. Verbal consecration is still not true consecration. You can be sanctified and genuinely consecrated only after you are enlightened and measured by God. Having a heart for God and a heart to offer up everything to Him is still useless. You have to be enlightened, judged, measured, and sanctified before there can be real service. The water of life will flow deeper and wider as you are measured more and more. There will be the fruit of life wherever the water of life goes, and others will receive the supply of life. O brothers and sisters, may we be measured by God again and again so that His life will flow out as a river of living water, going deeper and farther as it flows.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">NOT LOSING OUR TEMPER</h1><p>After a man has received the Lord's grace, there should be some definite changes in his conduct and nature. One of the changes should be in his temper. Some people have believed in the Lord for many years, yet their temper is still the same as it was before they were saved. This is very unfortunate, and it surely does not glorify the Lord. As soon as a man believes in the Lord, he should take care of the problem of his temper. It is wrong for a person to have a terrible temper for years without seeing any change at all.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPRESSIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>There are some clear expressions of the Christian life that should be exhibited as soon as a person is saved.</p><p>In John 15:12 the Lord charged the disciples to love one another. One expression of the Christian life is love. We have to love. We should love our brothers, and we should love all men.</p><p>The Lord also said, "Blessed are the meek" (Matt. 5:5). A Christian should have a meek attitude; he should not be stubborn. We should learn to have a meek attitude. "Behold, your King is coming to you, meek and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden" (21:5). The Lord was meek in His attitude; He came meek and mounted on a donkey.</p><p>Luke 9:23 says, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself...and follow Me." The Christian life is a life of denying the self. The Christian life should not be one that speaks for itself, fights for itself, or builds itself up; rather, it should be one that denies itself.</p><p>First Corinthians 13:7 says that love "endures all things." The Christian life should not be one of impatience, but one of endurance.</p><p>First Thessalonians 5:16 says, "Always rejoice." The Christian life should be one that always rejoices. Nothing should disturb our joy or quench our rejoicing.</p><p>Philippians 4:7 says, "And the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus." A Christian should not allow anything to disturb or usurp his peace. God's children should maintain their peace at all times.</p><p>Matthew 11:29 is also a very important verse. It is the Lord's own word: "I am meek and lowly in heart." A Christian should be lowly in heart. He should not be arrogant; rather, he should humble himself all the time.</p><h2 class="head1">TEMPER BEING INCOMPATIBLE<br />WITH THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>Love, meekness, self-denial, joy, peace, and humility are all proper expressions of the Christian life. Temper and anger are not compatible with these expressions.</p><p>Where there is love, there is no anger. Where love flourishes, anger does not exist. Where love is, temper does not exist. One cannot be loving and angry at the same time. The Lord's command is that a Christian should love others, whether they are unbelievers or believers. If love fills your heart, anger will depart. It is impossible to love a person and be angry with him at the same time. You must realize how important love is for a child of God. Love should not be in just your conduct; it must become your attitude as well. You should not love occasionally; rather, love has to be your attitude. If you have such an attitude, it will be impossible for you to lose your temper.</p><p>The Lord commands us to be meek, and He was very meek when He was on earth. He came on a donkey, which means that He does not reign with severity but in meekness. When the Lord was on earth, it was easy for men to talk to Him, invite Him, and approach Him. It is hard to talk with some people, but a Christian should be anything but unapproachable. It should not be a hard thing to approach him. A Christian should be meek. If we are meek in our attitude and nature, spontaneously we will not lose our temper easily. Temper makes a person hard; those who have a temper are crude in their emotion. Love and compassion are the finest of all human affections, while anger is the crudest. If a man is meek in the eyes of the Lord, he will not give any ground to anger. It is an expression of crudeness for one to constantly argue and lose his temper. This is not compatible with meekness.</p><p>The Lord charges us to deny ourselves and to learn to be self-denying. If a man denies himself and drops his rights, he will not get angry easily. Men become angry when they want to fight for themselves. If a man does not fight for himself, he will not need to lose his temper. Brothers and sisters, as children of God we should deny ourselves and not protect ourselves.</p><p>Sometimes others are unreasonable with us. Many things tend to provoke us, but the Bible says that love is not provoked (1 Cor. 13:5). The Lord shows us that we should be patient. Whatever the Lord allows to happen to us, we should be patient. The Lord's command is that a Christian's life be a life of patience. If we live a patient life, there will be no possibility of losing our temper.</p><p>A Christian should always rejoice. Joy is life. A man cannot be angry and rejoicing at the same time; this is impossible. Either you are rejoicing or you are angry. When you are angry, you cannot possibly be rejoicing. A man cannot be happy and angry at the same time. If the Lord's joy fills your heart, there will be no place in your life left for anger. The Lord has not given you ground for your anger. Brothers and sisters, if your life is filled with joy, your bad temper will be gone spontaneously.</p><p>The Lord intends that we be filled with peace. Nothing should disturb our peace. We should be at peace in the midst of everything, no matter what the circumstance. The Lord's peace guards our minds and hearts from all attacks. If our hearts are filled with this peace, it will be impossible for us to become angry.</p><p>A child of God should be one who humbles himself. God does not want us to be high-minded; He does not want us to sit in a high place. God's Son humbled Himself when He was on earth. He desires that we would also be lowly and that we would go along with the lowly (Rom. 12:16). Temper is incompatible with humility. We have to follow and learn of our lowly Lord who took a lowly way.</p><p>In Matthew 5:22 the Lord said, "But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment." The Lord is not pleased to see any of His own becoming angry or losing their temper easily. It is especially bad to get angry or lose our temper with our brothers. Every child of God should learn to control his temper and not become angry easily.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ROOT OF OUR ANGER&mdash;SELF</h2><p>Anger is a common thing, and there are many people who lose their temper easily. But temper is the most superficial of all problems. Strictly speaking, it should be dealt with the moment we believe in the Lord. It is wrong to see a person with an uncontrollable or unmanageable temper eight or ten years after he is saved. So many people lose their temper easily. Why? So many Christians have not dealt with this problem yet. Why? If we cannot answer these questions, we cannot be proper Christians. We must understand the reason that a man becomes angry easily before we can find the solution to this problem.</p><p>Temper is a big thing. Yet in reading the New Testament, we cannot find the word temper. The Bible does not pay much attention to what we consider as the most common sickness, because temper is not a sickness but the symptom of a sickness. A sickness is one thing, and the symptom of a sickness is another thing. A man may have appendicitis&mdash;this is a sickness. He may have a fever as well&mdash;this is a symptom of the sickness. Symptoms are present because a sickness is present. It is useless to try to deal with the symptoms without dealing with the sickness. The fever may subside temporarily, but the sickness remains, and after a while the fever will come back. Temper is not a sickness but the symptom of a sickness. Hence, we have to know the root of the sickness. Once we know the root, we can get rid of the temper. Once the sickness is gone, the symptoms will surely go away. We have to realize that temper is a symptom and not a root of sickness. It is wrong for us to consider temper a sickness. It is no wonder that we cannot deal with it, because we consider it as a sickness.</p><p>Many brothers have said that they have a problem with Romans 6:11 because they still cannot overcome their temper. Romans 6:11 says that we should reckon ourselves to be dead, but many people have a problem applying this verse. When they are about to lose their temper, they hurriedly try to recite Romans 6:11, saying, "I have died, and since I have died, I can no longer lose my temper." Yet this is not effective. Romans 6:11 is not about delivering us from the symptoms of sickness but about saving us from the sickness. It is useless if we try to apply it to our symptoms. If we try to reckon ourselves to be dead when we are about to lose our temper, we will still lose it. We may not lose it outwardly, but we will lose it inwardly.</p><p>What is the root of our temper? The simple answer lies with the self. If a man has not dealt with his self, he is heading in the wrong direction if he tries to deal with his temper. A man loses his temper because of the self. His self is his sickness; his temper is not his sickness. Because a man has the self, he has temper. If the self is dealt with before God, temper will be gone spontaneously. This is why the Bible pays attention to the self instead of our temper. Once the problem with the self is solved, the problem with temper is solved as well. As long as the problem with the self remains, the problem with temper remains. Concerning the self, there are several things that we should realize.</p><p>First, some people are very subjective. Those who are subjective are surely full of the self. They have opinions and concepts for everything, and they think that their concepts and opinions are never wrong. They also constantly insist on their opinions and proposals. They cannot stand any obstacles, frustrations, or breaking down. Their opinions must prevail and persist to the end. If anyone does not agree with their proposals or go along with their opinions, their subjective nature has no tolerance. Consequently, they lose their temper and become very angry. Brothers and sisters, if your eyes are only on your temper, you will never be healed of the sickness. Your sickness is your subjectivity and strong will; it is not your temper. Once your subjectivity is broken and your will and opinions are bruised, you will say to the Lord, "Lord, this is Your work, and I submit to You." If you do this, how can you lose your temper again? If you kneel down and say, "Lord, this is Your business; it is Your work" when your proposals are cut off, how can you lose your temper? It will be impossible for you to lose your temper. You only have a temper because you insist on your proposals and opinions. When you insist on your way of doing things, the self comes out and temper follows. No one can lose his temper if his self is removed. The root of your temper lies in the self. It is foolish to spend so much effort to deal with your temper while forgetting to deal with your self. Once a man believes in the Lord, the self must be broken. The self cannot remain whole before the Lord, and it is not worth keeping. If a man is free from the self, he will not lose his temper even when he is interrupted, frustrated, or tried.</p><p>Second, some people have a temper because they think they are better than others. They think highly of themselves and think that they are superb. In other words, they are proud. Everyone who is proud not only considers himself higher than others, but also demands that others admire and regard him highly. No proud person is satisfied with just having a high regard for himself. He is not content with just himself saying that he is good; he wants others to say that he is good. A proud person is not content with self-admiration; he wants everyone to admire him and the brothers and sisters to exalt him. If another brother does not appreciate his "worthiness," his "importance," or his high "spiritual attainment" or does not speak marvelously of him, he feels hurt and becomes angry! Where is the source of this anger? It comes from pride. A man becomes angry because he is proud. Brothers and sisters, if you remove your pride, you will remove your temper. It is impossible to remove one's temper without first removing his pride. The root of temper is pride. You will not lose your temper if you are a humble person in the eyes of God, if you consider others' jesting, despising, and slandering as the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and if you accept this disciplining work, saying, "Lord, this is all for my own good; these things have happened to me because You want to deal with my pride. Lord, I thank You for Your perfecting work in these things." Then when a brother does not obey and instead damages your standing, you will feel that pride is wrong and that it is all right to be hurt. If you do this, you will not lose your temper; rather, you will say to the Lord, "It is right for You to deal with my pride." If you know God's hand, you will not lose your temper. Brothers and sisters, temper is not a sickness. If you deal with temper as if you were dealing with a sickness, you will never succeed. You have to learn to prostrate yourself before the Lord and say, "You can do whatever You want." If you put your self aside and are willing to deny and deal with your self, you will see that your strength to lose your temper will be gone, your motivation to lose your temper will be gone, and your temper will lose its grip.</p><p>Third, as a consequence of self-exaltation, you think that others should not be as highly regarded as you. You only want to see yourself being uplifted; you do not want to see others being uplifted. You only want to gain something for yourself; you do not want others to gain anything. You rejoice at others' failure and are sad at others' success. This is jealousy, and jealousy occurs not only in the secular realm but also in the spiritual realm. Those who are proud rejoice at their brothers' failures and are unhappy when they see their brothers standing. This is a despicable attitude. No attitude is more despicable. If a man rejoices when others fall, he is the same as Satan, who loves to see others fall. What a shame for God's children to have Satan's sentiment! The meanest and most despicable sentiment is one which rejoices rather than grieves over a brother's fall. The basis for this kind of feeling is the desire for the self to be exalted. One hopes to see everyone around him fall in order that he can be exalted. Brothers and sisters, a person who knows God wants to see both himself and others rise. Those who do not know God want to see themselves rise, yet do not want to see others rise. They even hope to see others fall so that they can be exalted by the contrast. This is a despicable sentiment. Temper often comes because there is jealousy in the heart. If you are a self-exalting person, you will be angry if you see someone better and higher than you. Jealousy leads to anger. If you ignore jealousy and try to deal with just your temper, you will never succeed. You must uproot jealousy from your heart before you can remove your temper. If jealousy remains, your temper will flare up again and again.</p><p>Fourth, with some people the self is expressed in the form of self-love. They love themselves more than anyone else. Their attention is on themselves, and the only persons they treasure dearly are themselves. When it comes to eating, the most important ones to be taken care of are themselves. When it comes to lodging, the first ones to be taken care of are themselves. When it comes to bedding, the first ones to be taken care of are themselves. In everything related to the human life, the first ones in their mind are themselves. They want more benefit for themselves. They want more comfort for themselves. All of their thoughts are centered around themselves. They care for themselves and treasure themselves. When any discomfort comes their way, they become angry. Many people become angry because their self-love is hurt. They love themselves so much that they are not willing to suffer any hurt, pain, or embarrassment. Once their self-love is hurt and they fall into some discomfort, suffering, or embarrassment, they become very angry and lose their temper. Those who have learned this lesson before the Lord know that they live on this earth for the Lord and according to God's grace; they do not live according to their self-love. They live by His grace and not by their self-love. They realize that they live and stand because of His mercy and protection. When they live this way, they do not lose their temper even if they are very justified in doing so. Their self-love has been dealt with. Brothers and sisters, I hope that we realize that all of our temper stems from the self. If the self is not dealt with, temper will remain. We cannot expect anyone to stop their temper if the self is not dealt with. Those who do not deal with themselves will find that their temper is still with them.</p><p>Fifth, some brothers and sisters love themselves so much that they care only for their own things. They are only interested in their own affairs and have no interest in the affairs of others. They have no interest in helping others. Their conduct and thoughts are centered around themselves. They are the most important persons, and their affairs are the most important affairs. Their thoughts are on themselves, and whatever they do is for themselves. They are busy for themselves, and they care for themselves. Therefore, they have no time left for others. If others bother them, they become irritated, and their temper flares up. Their activities are centered around themselves, and they have no sympathy for others. They love themselves so much that they have no time to sympathize with others. They are so busy with themselves that they have no strength to bear others' sorrow. Many people lose their temper when others infringe upon their self-centered love; they feel disgusted and bothered, and they are impatient and angry. The root of all anger is in man's self. If we are not self-centered and are able to sympathize with others and if we learn to love others, we will not feel bothered and angry when others trouble us. We will feel that it is a joy to help others and that by helping others we are serving God. Therefore, we must not deal just with our temper, because it is not the root. We must deal with the root of the sickness. If our self is dealt with, our temper will be gone. The more thoroughly we deal with the self, the more our temper will go away.</p><p>Sixth, some people love not only themselves, but they have other kinds of love&mdash;they love things; they love money. Some people are not yet delivered from material possessions. Money and material possessions are precious to them. All kinds of things are precious to them. They have a self that craves things, objects. The expression of the self in these people is in their love for objects. If someone comes to their house and breaks an object or loses something that belongs to them, they become very angry because they are hurt; the self which is attached to the objects is hurt, and the result is anger. The cause of their anger lies within themselves, not in others. If you hit a piece of wood with your hand, what kind of sound will you hear? You will hear the sound of wood. If you knock on the wall, what kind of sound will you hear? You will hear the sound of the wall. If you knock on a piece of glass, what kind of sound will you hear? You will hear the sound of glass. The hand is the same, and the knocking is the same, but the sounds that are produced are different. One is wood, and the sound is the sound of wood. One is a wall, and the sound is the sound of a wall. One is glass, and the sound is the sound of glass. Different objects have different sounds because the nature of these things is different. An outward phenomenon is an expression of the inward nature of something. Our temper is within; it is not outside of us. If the self is gone, the environment cannot stir up our temper. A man loses his temper because there is the element of self within him. As long as the self is within, he will lose his temper given the right environment. The environment does not produce the temper; it merely brings out the temper that is within.</p><p>In conclusion, anger comes from man's self. As long as a person is angry, it means that a certain aspect of the self has not been dealt with. Perhaps many aspects of the self have not been dealt with, or perhaps one particular aspect of the self remains. Therefore, the extent to which one's temper is dealt with depends on the extent to which the self has been dealt with before the Lord. The more thoroughly a man's self is dealt with, the more he is delivered from his temper. If the self is not clearly dealt with, his temper will remain. We should not be so foolish as to just deal with our temper. We should remember that the problem of self is much deeper than the problem of temper. If we do not deal with the self, our temper will always be present. As we learn to prostrate ourselves before the Lord, we will be enlightened concerning the condition of the self, and God's mercy will bring about many things in our circumstances. If we have learned some lessons before the Lord, we will bow our head when these things come upon us and say, "Lord, Your arrangements are the best. It is good that You deal with my self this way. I submit and I accept these dealings." If you do this, your anger will not be vented. If you do not know the Lord's hand, like a mule that is without understanding, you will think that men or the environment are inflicting these dealings on you. When your eyes are set on men and the environment, you will be rebellious and angry. It is useless for a person to deal with his temper without first dealing with the self. We have to see that the root of temper is in us. Temper in a Christian is a sign of his refusal to accept the arrangement of the Holy Spirit in his environment. We have to learn to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit and set ourselves aside. We have to realize the futility of the self. If we do these things, the problem of temper will be solved spontaneously.</p><p>Immediately after believing in the Lord, we should deal with the problem of temper. We should not allow this problem to continue; nor should we deal with it only after we have been Christians for many years. A Christian should be one who denies himself. He should not be subjective, proud, jealous, self-loving, or self-caring, and he should not love money. We need to deny the self and realize that everything that comes upon us is under the Spirit's arrangement for our own good. We should learn to accept everything. We should not deal with our temper as a symptom, but we should deal with the root of the sickness. We cannot deal with our temper without dealing with the self. Where there is temper, there is the self. We have a quick temper because we have a quick disposition. However, do not think that those who are slow will not lose their temper. They lose their temper as well, except in a different way. As long as there is the self, there is temper. Brothers and sisters, in order for us not to lose our temper, we have to deal with the self. Once we are enlightened concerning the self, we will be delivered from our temper.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE LAW IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 8:4-8, 12, 14-17; 9:3-12, 15-17; 1 Tim. 5:22; 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6; James 5:14-16; Matt. 18:15-17, 20</h1><p>In order to live the life of the Body of Christ, we must first have the revelation of the Body of Christ. If we do not have the revelation of the Body of Christ, we will never cease our individual activities. Some have said that there is nothing extraordinary about seeing the Body of Christ. Yet, brothers and sisters, if you see the Body of Christ, you will know that there are laws in the Body of Christ and that you have to act according to these laws; these are not empty words. If a man sees Christ, he will not try to save himself by his own works. Similarly, if a man says that he has seen the Body yet is independent and individualistic in his conduct, he is not holding the Head and has not received the revelation of the Body. If a man has genuinely received the revelation of the Body, there will surely be some change in him, and he will surely seek fellowship and learn obedience.</p><h2 class="head1">AUTHORITY IN LIFE</h2><p>There are a few cardinal laws in the Body. Fellowship is one, and love is another. But another great law is submitting to the Head in conjunction with other members of the Body. A member by himself does not have any authority; the authority is with the Head. It is wrong for any member to say that he has authority. A member does not have direct authority; he can only derive authority from the Head. This authority is not a matter of position but a matter of life; it does not come by "appointment" but by one's "being." If a member is not an eye, the Body cannot appoint him to be the eye. If a member is not the hand, the Body cannot appoint him to be the hand. Because a member sees, he has the authority of seeing. Because a member can function, his function becomes a help to others.</p><p>In the church it is wrong to consider authority as a matter of position instead of life. It is wrong to make an appointment based on a person's social status rather than on his spiritual condition. God's Word shows that authority is in life, not in position. Authority lies in one's living, not in his appointment. A man has authority in the church not by his position but by being dealt with in his experience and in many concrete matters. He has learned something before the Lord which others have not learned. As a result, the Lord gives him authority in life. In the Body of Christ, all authority is in life. God has made some appointments in a local church, but these are not according to position but according to life. When life and appointment are joined together, there is the need for submission. If one does not submit, life will stop, and he will be detached from the Body; this is the meaning of "not holding the Head" (Col. 2:19). If there is a problem between you and the members, your relationship with the Head will not be normal. If you are at odds with other members, you may still have your doctrine and work, but the word of life will be gone from you. Brothers and sisters, you may have been a believer for three years, but how much genuine growth have you gained? It is a pity that while your manner and knowledge seem to have improved, the life of the Body of Christ has not increased. In the church you should learn to submit to one another. If the members do not submit to one another, the life spoken of in Romans 8 can never be manifested. You will feel like a deflated tire, and it will be difficult for you to advance. Those who see the Body of Christ will spontaneously see that submission is a joyful thing.</p><p>The case in Acts 8 shows us the principle of the Body. At that time the church in Jerusalem suffered the first great persecution. The apostles did not leave Jerusalem, but the brothers were all scattered. The scattered ones went everywhere to preach the word. Philip was not an apostle. His ministry was to care for the food. Yet because he had life, he went down to Samaria to preach Christ and performed miracles; he cast out many unclean spirits and healed many paralyzed and lame ones. The whole city of Samaria was filled with the gospel. The Bible says, "And there was much joy in that city" (v. 8). This shows that many in the city of Samaria had believed. The Lord used Philip. But if Philip had been proud, he could have said, "In Jerusalem Peter saved many. In Samaria I saved many." He could have considered himself a marvelous man in history. Philip preached the gospel in Samaria, but the experience of the ones saved in Samaria was different from the experience of the ones saved in Jerusalem. In Samaria the Spirit did not descend upon anyone. The Samaritans had genuinely believed, and they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Yet the Spirit did not descend upon anyone immediately. When the apostles heard this, they sent Peter and John to Samaria. When the two arrived, they prayed for the Samaritans to receive the Spirit. After the apostles laid hands on them, they also received the Spirit.</p><p>What is the meaning of the laying on of hands? Leviticus tells us that when one offered a sacrifice, he had to lay his hands on the head of the sacrifice. What does laying hands on the head of the sacrifice mean? Why is it that only the bulls that passed through the laying on of hands could be offered up, while myriads of other bulls in the world could not be offered up? To lay hands on a bull's head meant that a man was identified with the bull. The bull became him, and when the bull was offered up, it meant that he was offered up. When the bull was accepted, it meant that he was accepted. Hence, the laying on of hands means identification.</p><p>The New Testament speaks of the laying on of hands many times. First Timothy 5:22 says, "Lay hands quickly on no man, nor participate in others' sins; keep yourself pure." Since laying hands on someone is being identified with someone, we can become identified with others' sins if we are not careful. The meaning of the laying on of hands is identification and fellowship.</p><p>In the Old Testament, when kings and priests were appointed, someone laid hands and poured oil on their heads. Hence, the meaning of the laying on of hands is bringing men under the anointing of the Head and into the fellowship of the Body.</p><p>Today in the church the apostles are the representative members in the Body of Christ; they represent the authority of Christ. For the apostles to lay hands on the Samaritan believers meant that they acknowledged them as part of the Body. Once they were in the Body, the Spirit descended upon them. If the Samaritan believers had received the Spirit before the apostles came, it might have caused Philip to think, "The apostles can work in Jerusalem, and I can work in Samaria." Then the saved ones in Samaria would have been separated from the ones in Jerusalem. If someone had said that there was a Philip in Samaria just as there was a Peter in Jerusalem, the principle of the Body would have been destroyed. Then there would have been two works, one in Jerusalem and the other in Samaria, and the two would not have been under one work. The case in Samaria shows that one has to be subject to the Body before there can be the anointing. The anointing did not come down until the apostles from Jerusalem came and laid their hands on the believers. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Body; it is not the Spirit of individuals. It is fundamentally wrong for individuals to seek after the Holy Spirit. Some people are deceived, and some have received evil spirits because of their individualism. Some do not see the Body. The vessel that the Lord is after today is a Body vessel, not individual vessels. Individual work and fruit can never satisfy the Lord's heart and never achieve God's ultimate goal. All of our work should be carried out in the principle of the laying on of hands. The laying on of hands is an acknowledgment of identification and fellowship; it is also an acknowledgment that there is only one Body.</p><p>Hebrews 6:1-2 says, "Therefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be brought on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God, of the teaching of baptisms and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment." These six things belong to the word of the beginning, and they can be divided into three categories. The first category includes two kinds of conduct. The second category includes two outward testimonies. The third category includes two doctrines concerning the future. The two kinds of conduct are repentance from dead works and faith in God, the two outward testimonies are baptism and the laying on of hands, and the two doctrines concerning the future are resurrection and judgment. We may not have neglected five of these things, but we have neglected one of them&mdash;the laying on of hands. Although the Bible does not explicitly tell us to practice the laying on of hands, it shows us that at the time of the apostles those who were saved were baptized, and they also received the laying on of hands. Baptism puts us into Christ, while the laying on of hands puts us into the Body. The laying on of hands is a testimony not only of our relationship with Christ but also of our relationship with the Body. It brings us under the authority of the Head so that we will no longer be independent and so that we will reject all individualistic living and work.</p><p>Paul said, "And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it" (1 Cor. 12:26). Once you have received the laying on of hands, you are no longer an individual; you become a member in the Body. Once a man has received the laying on of hands, he should stand in his proper position.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAYING ON OF HANDS FOR THE GIFT</h2><p>Paul said to Timothy, "For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands" (2 Tim. 1:6). This means that the gift which Timothy had received at the time of the laying on of hands needed to be revived and rekindled. First Timothy 4:14 says, "Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given to you by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery." Here we see that the gift was given by the apostle with the presbytery by means of prophecy. They ushered Timothy into the Body through the laying on of hands, while the anointing bestowed the gift. While they laid their hands on Timothy and prayed for him, God gave one of them a prayer of prophecy, which foretold the kind of person that Timothy would be. This prayer governed the anointing. When an experienced person lays his hands on others, his prayer will become the characteristic of the life of those on whom he lays his hands. This is the authority of the Head dispensing the proper gift through the laying on of hands of the representative members. Those who receive the laying on of hands should realize that from that day on they can no longer trust in themselves and no longer be independent. They are a part of the Body, and they can no longer seek their own benefit. Even if they seek after spiritual things, they have to seek them for the sake of the Body. Thereafter, the Lord can use them or others. When other members are used, they are no longer envious. Many people work in an individualistic way, and they pursue in an individualistic way. We have to ask God to deliver us from these things in the same way that we asked Him to deliver us from sin.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER WITH THE ANOINTING OF OIL</h2><p>James 5:14 says, "Is anyone among you ill? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord." This must be read in conjunction with 1 Corinthians 11:29-31: "For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body. Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep. But if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged." Some become sick because they have acted contrary to physiological laws, while others become sick because they have acted contrary to the law in the Body of Christ. If a Christian does not discern the Body and does not act according to the rule of the Body, he will surely become weak and sick. This kind of sickness requires the elders' attention. The elders are appointed by God in a local church as representative members; they represent the Body of Christ in that locality. They should come and anoint the sick with oil. Psalm 133:2 says, "It is like the fine oil upon the head/That ran down upon the beard,/Upon Aaron's beard,/That ran down to the hem of his garments." The ointment was poured on Aaron's head, and it ran down from his head to his garments. God's ointment is on Christ's head; it is an ointment which the Holy Spirit gives to the Son. Christians receive their ointment by coming under Christ the Head. What does it mean for a sick man to ask the elders to pray for him? Suppose a man is sick. We can understand his sickness by looking at the medicine prescribed to him. When the elders are asked to come and anoint a sick man with oil, it means that he has detached himself from the ointment. If a Christian maintains his proper standing as a member, he will not lose his anointing. He becomes sick because he has not discerned the Body. The elders should bring the sick ones under the Head and recover them to the Body. If you live in the Body, you will not lose your anointing. If you leave the Body, you either become sick or you die. Brothers and sisters, everything will be well if you really see the life of the Body and live in the Body.</p><p>The sickness in James 5 is a special kind of sickness. We know that it is a special sickness and not an ordinary one because verse 15 says, "And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him." What kind of sin did he commit? The sin he committed must have been the sin of being detached from the Body of Christ. If his sin were a personal sin, he would only need the blood, and he would be forgiven when he confessed to men and dealt with the sin. There would be no need to ask the elders to come and anoint him with oil before he could be forgiven. The anointing of the elders cannot remove sin; only the blood can wash us of our sins. Yet verse 15 says that if he sins, his sins will be forgiven. This forgiveness comes from the prayer of the elders. Hence, the sin in this verse is different from ordinary sins. This sin is the sin of walking contrary to the Body. This sin cannot be forgiven if one just prays to God; the elders need to pray for him before he can be forgiven. He has to look to others for this forgiveness.</p><p>Verse 16 is even more peculiar: "Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed. The petition of a righteous man avails much in its working." This verse says that we should confess our sins to one another. We have to confess our sins to one another because something is wrong in the Body of Christ, and the mutual confession of sins is needed. The sick have to confess to the elders, and the elders have to confess to the sick. This shows that when one member is in trouble, the whole Body is responsible. If one member who has been healthy in all respects suddenly becomes sick, the elders have to take responsibility for it. It may be that the elders have been lacking in love. It may be that the elders have been negligent in care. Therefore, the elders have to confess these sins. As for the sick, they have to confess the sin of acting independently and the sin of detaching themselves from the Body.</p><p>Not only do we have to confess our sins to one another, but we also have to pray for one another. Praying for one another is asking that the elders pray for the sick ones and that the sick ones pray for the elders. Hence, there is always the need for love and humility in the Body. If a person is detached from the Body, he will incur spiritual sickness as well as physical sickness. Whenever he is detached from the Body, he loses the anointing. Those who are outside the Body need to realize the importance of returning to the Body and coming under the anointing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION PAUL RECEIVED<br />AT THE TIME OF HIS REPENTANCE</h2><p>Acts 9 shows us two characteristics of the revelation that Paul received at the time of his repentance. On his way to Damascus, Paul saw a light from heaven, which shone around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice, saying, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" (v. 4). The Lord said, "Why are you persecuting Me?" He did not say, "Why are you persecuting those who believe in Me?" Paul asked, "Who are You, Lord?" The Lord answered, "I am Jesus, whom you persecute" (v. 5). The Lord showed Paul that all the believers are one with Him. This is the oneness between the Head and the Body. Paul was the first one in the Bible to see the testimony of the Body. One cannot touch the members without touching the Head. Never think that you can offend the brothers without offending Christ. You must remember that anyone who touches a small member of the Body touches the Head. The hurt is in the members, but the pain is felt in the Head.</p><p>Paul was a person who was greatly used by the Lord. Yet on the way to Damascus the Lord told him, "Rise up and enter into the city, and it will be told to you what you must do" (v. 6). The Lord meant, "I will not tell you what you should do. Others will tell you." The Lord used others to tell him what he should do. This was a revelation of the Body; it was a great revelation. The day that Paul was saved, the Lord showed him the principle of the Body. Although Paul was a vessel greatly used by the Lord, God chose another person to come to his aid. Brothers and sisters, never think that we have no need of others and that we can receive everything from the Lord by ourselves. I am not saying that we should follow blindly or that we should go along with others all the time. I am saying that we should not have the attitude that we can receive God's word by ourselves and solve every problem by ourselves. What did Paul do? "And Saul rose from the ground; and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. And they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. And he was three days without seeing, and he neither ate nor drank" (vv. 8-9). Paul was in the city for three days before anyone came to tell him what to do. Had he been impatient, he would not have been able to endure this. After three days, Ananias came. The name Ananias had not been mentioned before this, and we do not see his name mentioned after this. He was not a famous person. Yet the Lord seized him by His authority and sent him to help the greatest of all apostles. The great apostle could not enlighten his understanding by himself; he needed a little brother who was not known by many to open his understanding. Once Ananias met Paul, he laid hands on Paul and said, "Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me&mdash;Jesus, who appeared to you on the road on which you were coming&mdash;so that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit" (v. 17). Laying hands on Paul and calling him "Saul, brother" led him into the Body and filled him with the Holy Spirit; this brought him under the anointing.</p><p>Often the inner leading of the Holy Spirit leads us to the leading of others; He leads us to receive help from others. If we refuse help from others, we will lose many things. Some Christians make decisions according to their own feelings. Where then is the Body? They are living fully in the realm of individualism; they do not see the Body. Brothers and sisters, please consider how many of our actions in the past were in the Body. We have to see that we are members and that we are restricted. We have to receive help from other members. May the Lord show us the Body now. The kind of people who have seen the Body are those who seek fellowship, who are afraid of making mistakes, and who dare not work individualistically.</p><h2 class="head1">THE JUDGMENT OF THE BROTHERS</h2><p>Matthew 18:15-16 says, "Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established." It does not say that your brother has to feel that he is wrong; rather, it says that if two or three brothers say that he is wrong, he is wrong. It is a matter of whether or not he is wrong. It is not a matter of whether or not he feels that he is wrong. Suppose a brother says to you, "You have offended me in a certain way." However, you do not feel that you were wrong, and you pray. After you pray, you may still feel that you were not wrong; therefore, you may tell the brother, "Although you said that I offended you, I do not feel that way. I have prayed and still feel that I have not offended you. I did not pray lightly; I prayed seriously, but I do not feel that I was wrong. I am not reluctant to confess my wrong; I would much rather admit that I was wrong, but I do not see that I was wrong." Then the brother may tell another brother, and both of them come and say that you are wrong. You are a humble person and do not want to refuse confession, yet you do not see any wrong. You feel that you cannot confess your wrong. After you pray again, there may still be no change. However, at that point the Lord may say, "When the brothers say that you are wrong, you are wrong no matter how you feel."</p><p>Matthew 18:20 reveals the reason that we are wrong even when we think we are right&mdash;the brothers think we are wrong. "For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst." It is wrong to take this verse as a promise. The Lord had no intention that this verse be used as the basis for seeking His presence. This verse says that when two or three are gathered into His name, He is in their midst. The meaning of being gathered into His name is to be free from individualism, no longer trusting in oneself, but standing on the ground of the Body of Christ. When we all have Christ, He will be in our midst. If two or three deny themselves and stand for Christ, the Lord will manifest Himself. When they are in harmony with one another, they will have the Body. When we stand on the ground of the Body, the Lord's authority is there. When Christ is in our midst, we can represent Christ. Hence, when brothers see that we are wrong and we do not see that we are wrong, we should listen to the two or three rather than to ourselves. I am not saying that we should listen to others indiscriminately. I am saying that if two or three deny themselves and are gathered into the Lord's name, we would be wise to accept and trust their judgment and to admit that we are wrong.</p><p>There are four kinds of people in the church who can represent the Body: (1) apostles, (2) elders, (3) individual believers who are commissioned by the Lord, such as Ananias who was commissioned by the Lord to speak to Paul, and (4) the two or three believers who have denied themselves and gathered into the Lord's name. These four groups of people represent the Body. If you are wrong, the Lord will send an individual believer to come and speak to you. If you do not take the word of the individual believer, he will tell two or three other believers. If you do not take the word of the two or three believers, the elders should come to help you. You cannot act individualistically. Many unsolvable problems require the apostles to come. They are the ones the Lord has chosen particularly to represent the Body. We should inform the elders and the apostles of all important matters, lest there be any ambiguity. We should do this in order to receive their help. We cannot neglect the Body and cannot neglect the representatives of the Body. If we neglect the representatives of the Body, we will not be able to practice the Body life. May God grant us not only the revelation of the Body but also the testimony of the Body, and may He cause us to submit to the representatives of the Body.</p><p>Once a man is saved, he is brought into the fellowship of the Body. May the Lord cause us to submit not only to the Lord but also to the Body. May the Lord truly deliver us from individualistic and independent acts so that we can fully live out the Body life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">SERVING AS MEMBERS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:4-5</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, we know that we are believers. But how many of us know that we are not just believers but members as well? We know that part of the Adamic life is sinful and natural, and we have to deal with both of these things. However, we also have to deal with the individualistic life. What is the individualistic life? It is the life that exists independently, lives independently, and acts independently. It is the life which lives as if it is the only life on this earth. This individualistic life frustrates us from being blended into the Body of Christ. We must realize that the opposite of the Body is individualism. In order to be blended into the Body, we have to be delivered from our individualism.</p><p>The Body of Christ is not a doctrine; it is something that we have to enter into. If we do not enter into the Body, we will not know the Body. Those who are saved can easily spot those who are not yet saved. In the same way, those who are in the Body can easily spot those who are not in the Body. At the time you were saved, you did not merely hear the doctrine of salvation; you saw Christ as a vibrant life. Some are in the Body of Christ already, while others are not in it. Brothers and sisters, when you were saved, you were brought into a new realm. After you entered that new realm, you clearly could see the condition of those who were not saved. In the same way, those who are living in the Body clearly see the condition of those who are not in the Body. Those who are not in the Body of Christ feel that they are the only person living on the earth and that they are everything. A man can understand the book of Romans and still not be saved. In the same way, a man can understand the book of Ephesians and still not see the Body of Christ. We are delivered from sin, and we are in Christ. It is true that we are saved, but we need another salvation that delivers us from individualism into the Body of Christ.</p><p>It is all right for us to live as individuals, but it is not all right for us to be individualistic. God allows us to be individuals, but He does not allow us to be individualistic. Before we enter the Body of Christ, we are saturated with individualism; even our spiritual pursuit is based on our individualism. Why do we want to be holy? We want to be holy for ourselves. Why do we want power? We want power for ourselves. Why do we want fruit for our work? We want fruit for ourselves. Why do we pursue the kingdom? We pursue it because we ourselves want to gain it. Why are we seeking? We are seeking for ourselves. Everything is centered around "ourselves." But this is not the Body. This is individualism. On the day of Pentecost, three thousand people were saved. We may think that it would be wonderful if we could save three thousand in one day and bear so much fruit, but we have to remember that eleven apostles also stood up together with Peter. Did the other apostles say, "Peter can save men, and so can we. Is Peter the only one who can have a platform and who can save men?" We know, of course, that no such words were spoken. God is not after individual vessels; He is after a corporate vessel. Those who have genuinely seen the Body of Christ are not jealous of others. It does not matter who is doing the work. Everything is in the Body and has nothing to do with individuals.</p><p>Therefore, we must consider ourselves not only as believers but also as members. I am a member; therefore, I am not the whole or even the half. I am only a small part of the Body. If you see the Body and see that you are only a member, this will be a great salvation to you. In the past you might have considered everything in an individualistic way. Your work was an individual work, and your life was an individual life. Everything was individual. When you see the Body, you are spontaneously delivered from individualism. You see Christ, and then you are saved. In the same principle, you see the Body, and then you are spontaneously delivered from individualism to become a member. You do not look at a situation that confronts you and then deliberate whether or not you should act according to the principle of the Body. Rather, you receive the vision and revelation and are brought into the Body. Then spontaneously you act according to the principle of the Body. Once your natural life is dealt with, you spontaneously see that you are a member.</p><p>What does being a member mean? It means that all of our work and living are based on the Body; the Body is the unit of operation. When my hands work, it is not my hands that are working, but my body that is working. When my feet walk, it is not my feet that are walking, but my body that is walking. Every move of the members has the Body as its unit of operation. What one member does is what the whole Body does. When the members walk, the Body is walking. Nothing that the members do is for themselves. Everything that the members do is for the Body. Every move of the members is based on the Body, not on the members. We are happy if God puts us in the first place, and equally happy even if He puts us in the last place. Only the ones who do not see the Body can be proud, and only they can be jealous of others.</p><p>We have to see the relationship between the members and the Body. A member cannot replace the Body; yet it can affect the Body. Even our personal failures or uncleanness affect the Body. Although no one knows or sees our own personal, hidden failures, the devil knows and sees. When a member fails, the Body is affected. Therefore, our pursuit of a life of love, holiness, and spiritual growth is something for the Body.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should ask ourselves, "Are we independent persons, or are we members? Are we merely believers, or are we members?" Brothers and sisters, it is true that we are Christians, but when we contact others, we may be at odds with them in less than five minutes; we cannot be one with them. This proves that we are not living as a member. The Lord is not satisfied with this. May He give us light so that we will have a clear vision of this. Once we see the Body, spontaneously we will be delivered from individualism, and spontaneously we will become living members.</p><p>If our individualism is not smashed, God cannot secure a vessel to fulfill His plan or express the fullness of Christ. God wants a Body to be His vessel. Yet this vessel can only be realized when all the members are joined together as a Body; anything less falls short of God's goal.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Every member has a part in the service of the Body of Christ. Everyone who belongs to the Lord has his portion and has Christ living within. Everyone has received something special, and this becomes the special portion of his service. We serve the Body with what we have received of Christ.</p><p>Our portion of service in the Body of Christ is based on our knowledge of Christ. This knowledge is not a common knowledge; common knowledge is not enough. Only by having a specific knowledge of Christ can we have a specific ministry to serve the Body of Christ. Our special service is based on our special knowledge of Christ. We can only serve after we have learned something that others have not learned, something special from the Lord, some special knowledge of Christ. The eyes see, the ears hear, and the nose smells. Every part has a special function. It is not necessary for all the members to see, hear, or smell. Yet every member has something special that they can do; that is their ministry. What is our special ministry? It is what we have learned from the Lord, what we have acquired in a particular way from Him. Once we have a special knowledge of Christ, that knowledge becomes our particular ministry. Only those who have a special ministry can serve the Body and cause the Body to grow. Only that which comes from above can cause the Body to grow. Only after we have learned something from the Lord can we transmit the life of the Head to the Body, and only then can we supply the church with what it does not have. Therefore, every member must press on continually and must receive from the Lord what the Body has not yet received and transmit that to the Body of Christ. Today the Lord is seeking men into whom He can dispense His life and through whom the life of the Body can grow. Through these ones the church will receive a measure of life which it has not yet received. The measure of the church's stature will increase, and they will become a channel of life to the Body. When the life which they have received from the Lord flows out to others, the stature of the Body of Christ grows. God is increasing the stature of the Body of Christ through the members.</p><p>The meaning of serving the Body of Christ is to receive life from the Head for the supply of the Body. It is to transmit the life that is in the Head to the church. When the eyes see, the body sees. The eyes supply the body with their seeing; this is what it means to serve as members. The hands cannot detect the smell of an object; it takes the nose to serve the body with its smelling function. Smell is the specific ministry of the nose. The ears serve the body with their hearing. Hearing is the specific ministry of the ears. The result of the work of every ministry is the growth of the stature of the Body. In other words, it is the Body gaining more of Christ. The ministry of the members is the ministry of Christ to the church; it is to dispense Christ to others.</p><p>Service in the Body of Christ is based on the knowledge of Christ, and this knowledge does not come from doctrines; rather, it comes from the experience of life. One great problem is that many people replace life with doctrines. Doctrines are useless. Even if one becomes very familiar with doctrines and can recite and speak about them, he can still be completely blind and ignorant. A man does not receive help through understanding doctrines. Understanding doctrines only provides more thoughts for the mind. God needs life to express the doctrines. God first gives us life, and then He gives us the doctrines. This is true in both the Old Testament and New Testament.</p><p>God first gained Abraham as a man of faith. When others see Abraham, they see the doctrine of faith. Abel saw that man could not come to God without the shedding of blood. Hence, Abel carries with him the doctrine of justification in the blood (Rom. 5:9).</p><p>First there is life, and then there is the doctrine. First there is the problem, and then there is the solution. First there is the experience, and then there is the doctrine. Martin Luther went through painful experiences in search of justification. One day God showed him that man is justified by faith. Through faith he was justified. Later we were given the doctrine of justification by faith. First there is life, and then there is doctrine.</p><p>We must never spend all our time in researching, analyzing, or studying doctrines. These are works of reeds; they will not help us when we are faced with real difficulties. The only things that will be of any use to us are the experiences that God brings us through. Experience must come first; then doctrine can follow.</p><p>The New Testament begins with the Gospels. The Epistles are after the Gospels. The Gospels tell us what Christ did, and the Epistles explain the reasons. First there are the experiences of Christ, and then there are the doctrines of Christ. First we have the life of Christ, and then we have the teachings of Christ.</p><p>If a man does not have a special knowledge of Christ, he cannot have a ministry. A man will have a ministry only after he receives something special from Christ. Whatever special function a member has becomes the ministry of that member. The hand has its special functions, and these special functions become its ministry. God allows all kinds of pain, discipline, and trial to come upon us in order to constitute us with His word and so that we can have something to give to the Body. Other than Christ and other than life, nothing will minister to the Body of Christ. Christ is life, and the church will be built up only when Christ is supplied to it. Those who do not have life can kill a prayer meeting even when they say, "Amen." In contrast, those who have life can supply a prayer meeting with a simple word of "Amen." When a person of life sits in a meeting, others will feel the life. The measure of knowledge of Christ determines the amount of life supplied to the church.</p><p>Today God is looking for men. He wants to deposit great measures of Christ's life into them so that they can become a supply to others. Life requires a channel. God wants man to become a channel of life, through whom life can be transmitted to the Body. If life stops in you, you will not be able to supply others with life, and the church will suffer loss. You will be spreading death, not supplying life to the church. Failures of individuals invariably cause damage to the church. This is why all the members suffer when one member suffers in the Body of Christ. You may fail or neglect your prayer in your private room, but the Body will be the one who suffers. Every member affects everyone else. We must not live by ourselves; we must hold to the Head and seek fellowship. Before we make any decision, we should first seek fellowship. Everything has to be in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body. We should do things in the Body and not as individuals. We should do things through the Body and not through individuals, and we should do things for the Body and not for individuals. May God open our eyes to see the Body, and may we serve the church with our ministry, a ministry which comes from our knowledge of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE FUNCTION AND HARMONY<br />OF THE MEMBERS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:12-13, 15-16</h1><p>One of the most important aspects of the walk of a person who lives for the Lord and who is free from the self is his function in the Body of Christ. In the Body of Christ, every member has a function. This is a fact. If you do not function as a member, this proves that you do not live for the Lord and that you are not yet free from your self. If you are free from your self inwardly, your living will spontaneously manifest the particular function that you have as a member of the Body of Christ. Whether you are a brother or a sister, you have a function in the church. You may feel that you are living for the Lord and that you are free from your self, but your feeling is not reliable as long as you are not functioning as a member in the Body. If you are truly free from your self and truly living for the Lord, you will surely have your function as a brother or a sister in the church. Brothers and sisters, we should not deceive ourselves by thinking that we are free from the self and that we are living for the Lord. If we have not reached this stage yet and our function has not been realized in the church, this is a strong proof that we are not yet living for the Lord outwardly and are not free from our self inwardly. If we are truly freed from our self inwardly and living for the Lord outwardly, we will function in the Body of Christ spontaneously.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should never think that the grace we have received is too small and that we have no function in the church or in the Body of Christ. As long as we are members, we have a definite function. Everyone who has the life of God is a member of the Body of Christ, and no member is so small that he does not have any function. Even the least of all the members has a function in the Body. We must never despise any member or consider him to be so small that he does not have a function. Every member has a function, and his function cannot be replaced by any other member. No matter how small his function is, no one can replace that function. The greatest function cannot replace the smallest function. Every member has a particular function, and no one else can replace him. I cannot replace your function, and you cannot replace my function. If we see this, we will jump with joy.</p><p>It is no wonder that there is a need for so many apostles. The Gospels in the New Testament were written by four people. When we read the Gospel of Matthew, we see one aspect of Christ. When we read the Gospel of Mark, we see another aspect of Christ. When we read the Gospel of Luke or the Gospel of John, we see yet other aspects of Christ&mdash;His holiness and His glory. When we read the Epistles of Peter, we see the greatness of Christ. When we read Paul's Epistles, we find things expressed in another way. When we read the Epistles of John, we find that he described the excellencies of Christ in a way like no one else. Our Lord is so great that He requires all the believers past and present, here and everywhere, and throughout all the ages to express Him adequately. Brothers and sisters, the outflow of life is the expression of Christ. The Body is where life is manifested. This life is one; however, when it is expressed in different members, it is manifested in different functions. When this life flows to the ears, the ears hear. When this life flows to the eyes, the eyes see. When this life flows to the feet, the feet walk. When this life flows to the mouth, the mouth speaks. When this life flows to the teeth, the teeth bite. The life is one, yet there are many functions. Although the functions are different, the life remains one. Brothers and sisters, what flows into you is the same as what flows into me; it is the life of Christ. Yet the function that is manifested in you is different from the function that is manifested in me. Many times the work that one brother is able to do could never be done by another brother. For certain things you have to go to certain brothers, and for certain other things you have to go to certain sisters. It will not work if you use another person. As a member you have a special function. The function which is manifested in you through the inflow of Christ's life can never be replaced by another. It does not matter how small you are, you will always have a function as a member.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, you can test yourself in the following way: If you are in a local church and your function has not been manifested, this proves that your living outwardly is not for the Lord and that your life inwardly is not yet freed from the self. This is a very specific test. I am not saying that you have a small function; I am saying that it does not seem to matter whether or not you are in the church. If your function is not manifested, you are not living for the Lord outwardly, and you are not yet broken by Him inwardly. We must realize that in order for the Lord to preach the gospel, carry out His work, and fulfill His will on earth, He must work through His Body. The Lord's will and way cannot be accomplished through one man. He cannot carry out His work through one man; He has to do it through the church.</p><p>The vessel that God uses is not individuals but the church. The life and power of Christ can only be fully manifested through the Body. Hence, the chief work of Satan is to "disintegrate" the Body. He is trying his best to do this. If we consider everything from this view, we will see the seriousness of Satan's work of disintegration. Brothers and sisters are suspicious of one another, and misunderstandings abound; this is the disintegrating work of Satan. We may complain about a brother or murmur against a sister, but if we looked into the reason for this, we would find that there is no great reason other than Satan's disintegrating work among us. Satan wants to divide God's children; he wants to disintegrate them. God's work is to integrate us, whereas Satan's work is to disintegrate us. He is doing his disintegrating work through our corrupted flesh, our strong self, and the world we love. Strictly speaking, the most crucial matter is not whether we deal with the flesh, deny ourselves, or love the world. The crucial matter is that Satan is doing his disintegrating work through these things. When we allow these things to remain in us, we are giving ground to Satan.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, what is oneness? Oneness is God Himself. Why do we say that oneness is God Himself? When we drop all the things outside of God and live in God, He Himself becomes the oneness within us. Oneness is God gaining the full ground within us&mdash;we are after God and God is filling us. Only when God's children are filled with God can they be in harmony with one another. Satan does not need to make us argue or fight with one another. As long as he can put a little impurity within us and as long as there are things that usurp the place of God, this is enough to disintegrate us. Whenever mud sticks to the sand that is used in mixing cement, the resulting concrete will not be compact. In order to destroy the oneness, Satan does not have to do much; all he has to do is sprinkle a little dust within us&mdash;things that are incompatible with God's life&mdash;and we will be disintegrated. There is no need for us to argue or fight. As long as he can sprinkle a little dust within us, that is enough. We can still break bread and drink the cup together, but we are disintegrated. The Body of Christ is absolutely not a doctrine or an organization; it is a life. What is the church? The church is not a matter of scriptural doctrines or scriptural ways. The church is a life; it is the expression of the life of Christ. Oneness is only in life. There is no need for argument or dispute; as long as Satan can put a little impurity in us and others, we will become disintegrated unconsciously! May the Lord be merciful to us and remove all impurities in us, and may He sift us with the cross and the indwelling Spirit.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, do our own inclinations occupy a place within us? Do our own goals occupy a place within us? Does our own work occupy a place within us? Or do we allow the life of Christ to have all the ground within us? Every one of us has to turn back to God. We do not need outward revivals. We have only one need&mdash;to turn back to God, allowing Him to cleanse us and sift us with the cross and the Spirit. We pray that the sifting work of the cross and the Spirit will remove the satanic mixture within us. In order for this to happen, we have to turn back to God. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we will not put any trust in ourselves. Brothers and sisters, even right things can be used by Satan to disintegrate us. We have to learn to turn back to God and receive His enlightening, and we have to learn to go to the brothers and sisters and receive their corrections. We have to learn to pay the greatest price to receive the dealing of the cross so that we can function as members in the church. Have we not said that we love the Lord? Have we not said that we are consecrated? If we have, we have to leave no ground for ourselves and be ready to pay any price. May the Lord cleanse us and remove the mixture and elements that cause disharmony so that the life of Christ can be expressed through us and so that through this same one life we can manifest the functions of the members and live out the testimony of the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">LIFE IN THE DEPTHS</h1><p class="indent1">(Editor's Note: The following article is translated from the Chinese series, Twelve Baskets Full, Volume 7, chapter twelve. The content is similar to the second "Preparation Message" given by Watchman Nee in the Third Overcomer Conference in January 1934 (see Volume 11 of The Collected Works). Since we have no assurance that this article is taken from the same spoken message, we have included it in this volume.)</p><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 4:5-6, 16-17; Hosea 14:5-7; S.S. 4:12</h1><p>From the above three passages we can see the kind of Christian living that God delights in and the kind of living that is enduring and unchanging, one that survives blows and withstands tests. Why do some Christians look quite promising at the beginning of their Christian experience, yet are nowhere to be found after a period of time? Why do some drop out halfway? Why are some unable to follow the Lord to the end? The answer is very much related to the way a Christian lives. If a Christian does not live a normal Christian life, he is shaky, and it is easy for him to drop out. Therefore, we must not neglect this problem.</p><h2 class="head1">A SHALLOW LIFE</h2><p>Mark 4:5-6 says, "And other seed fell on the rocky place, where it did not have much earth, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth. And when the sun rose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered." This is one of the many parables the Lord Jesus spoke on the sowing of seeds. In verses 16 and 17 the Lord explains the parable to the disciples: "And likewise, these are the ones being sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy. Yet they have no root in themselves, but last only for a time; then when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately they are stumbled." From the Lord's explanation we see that a shallow life cannot endure or stand the test of trials. Apparently this kind of life has a good start, but eventually, it ends miserably. The appearance of this kind of life is that "immediately it sprang up." Since it has sprung up, the outer shell of the seed has burst, and it has sprouted. This means that the word is no longer merely a doctrine to a person. It has been transformed into life. It has sprouted and sprung up immediately. As far as its appearance is concerned, it has advanced very fast and progressed in a wonderful way. One should be satisfied with such a growth. However, its end is disappointing because it becomes scorched when the sun comes up and it withers away. It springs up immediately but withers quickly. Sprouts that cannot withstand the heat of the sun have little hope of ripening and wither away quickly. This is the condition of many Christians. Shortly after they hear the word, they receive it with joy under the illusion that they have everything, understand everything, and are prepared to pay any price and embark on any way. Before God they have the will and the consecration; before men they bear their testimony and zeal. However, when trials soon befall them, they immediately shake and become dismayed. They find things to be unbearable. They flinch through fear and eventually fall away. Brothers and sisters, as long as we are Christians, the scorching of the sun is indispensable; it helps our growth and assists our ripening. If we are shaken and fall away as soon as we meet the scorching of the sun, it indicates that we are shallow. The scorching of the sun only exposes our true condition; it will not rob us of what we really possess. Does the word of God wither at the scorching of the sun? No. The problem is how we received the word. Why does God's word sprout immediately and then wither away as soon as it is exposed to the scorching of the sun? What is the reason for this? The Bible shows us three reasons.</p><h2 class="head2">Shallowness of Ground</h2><p>The first reason that the word withers away is the shallowness of the ground. This means there is not much soil and consequently no depth; there is only a little soil on the ground. A Christian with shallow ground has very little inside of him. When such a person hears the word, every sentence seems to be well received and easily comprehended. He is apt to relay the word to other people and ready to bear witness before men. However, it is just as easy for this kind of person to lose the truth, overthrow the truth, and deny what he has said to other people. He is satisfied easily, and he becomes hungry easily. He is happy and sad easily; he is excited and cooled easily; he laughs and weeps easily. Such a person is very shallow; he lives in his emotions and circumstances.</p><p>We know that if a tree is big, its roots must be deep. Some trees can reach a depth of several hundred feet. A tree which cannot absorb water from the surface will send its roots deep until it finds a source of water. The palm trees in the Arabian Desert survive with green foliage, despite the scorching of the sun, because they draw water from the depths, enabling them to defy the blazing sun. If a Christian sends his roots down, he will not need to fear the scorching of the sun. Everyone who lives by his circumstances or in his feelings is living on shallow ground. Those who are prone to be swayed by their emotions or influenced by circumstances are similarly shallow. However, those whose lives are deeply rooted do not care about their circumstances; they do not live by feeling but solely by faith. They do not look to or depend upon circumstances. Instead they look to the Lord behind the circumstances. Such persons receive their sustenance, support, and power from God instead of from the circumstances. If a person lives by his emotions and circumstances, instead of trusting in the Lord behind the circumstances, he will not be able to hold fast to a single truth or teaching. When circumstances are favorable, he will be energetic and elated, but as soon as he encounters trials, he will become disheartened and depressed. He will fall as soon as he is confronted with the cross. Brothers and sisters, if you retreat when trials come, it proves that you are a shallow person. When the sun scorches, you will wither away immediately.</p><h2 class="head2">Lacking in Root</h2><p>The second reason that the word withers away is the lack of root. What are roots? The section of a tree that is above the ground is the trunk, and the section that is hidden under the ground is the root. The visible life-section is the branches; the invisible life-section is the root. Therefore, the root represents the hidden life. Those who are rootless in the Lord live a dry life. Those who have no hidden spiritual life, except that which is manifest before men, have no root. The root is the hidden, invisible part. What is exposed and visible is not the root. Brothers and sisters, we should ask ourselves: Besides the part of our life which is visible before men, how much hidden life do we have before the Lord? If all that we have is that which is exposed, it is no wonder that we wither away as soon as the sun comes and scorches us. In our spiritual life nothing sustains us like the hidden life. If we see a brother or sister falling away, do not regard the fall as an accidental or sudden occurrence. Instead, we should realize that there must be something wrong with his hidden life before God. Since he has no root, he falls when the sun rises to scorch him.</p><p>In Matthew 6:6 the Lord Jesus said, "But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you." To shut the door is to have a hidden life, and this is to have roots. The Lord spoke in a very peculiar way: The Father will see in secret. Oh, praying can be seen! We think that praying is heard, but the Lord said that it is seen. Sometimes when we are before the Lord, we have no words; there is only an attitude&mdash;this is precious also. Brothers and sisters, what proportion of our life is seen by God in secret? Is all that we have apparent before men? How much of our spiritual life before God has never been divulged? How much experience do we have which is comparable to what Paul kept secret from other people for fourteen years (2 Cor. 12:2)? If we have none, it indicates that we have no root. If we are persons without root, we will immediately fall away when the sun comes up to scorch us. Brothers and sisters, only the part of us which can survive the test of trials is reliable. If our roots are not deep enough, we are bound to fail.</p><h2 class="head2">The Rocky Place</h2><p>The third reason that the word withers away is that there are rocks underneath the shallow earth. A person with shallow earth may be willing to send his roots deep, but rocks may obstruct them. Outwardly, he is the same as other people, but within him there are hidden sins and a hardened self. In the Bible the word rock has several meanings&mdash;one relates to a stony heart (Ezek. 36:26). If we wish to send our spiritual roots deep, we should not harden our hearts (Heb. 3:8). Many Christians have never experienced the breaking of their concepts and have never been broken. They give many reasons to reject God's will and insist on their own views. They always have opinions as to whether something should be done this way or that way. They have rocks within, and their hearts are very hard. God has to blast these inner rocks away before they can strike their roots. There is only one kind of people who can strike roots: those who tremble at the word of the Lord (Isa. 66:5). Brothers and sisters, a heart that is not submissive to God is a stony heart. We should ask God to enlighten us and show us how big the rocks within us are. If we have rocks inside, we cannot strike roots, and when the sun comes up and scorches, how can we escape from withering away?</p><p>Rocks not only stand for a hardened heart but also for hidden sins. Perhaps there is a particular sin in your life which you have not given up because the price is too high, and you do not have the courage to deal with it. Perhaps God's demand is strong; consequently, you reason and argue with God because you cannot obey. If you allow your hidden sins to remain, you cannot strike roots. When the sun comes up and scorches, how can you escape from withering away?</p><h2 class="head1">THE SCORCHING OF THE SUN</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, without light we will not realize how shallow we are. Without the scorching of the sun, we will not understand why those who spring up fast also wither away fast. How often we are deceived into complacency with our spiritual state! Yet we regard ourselves as wonderful people! To our great surprise, when the sun comes up and scorches us, we immediately wither away.</p><p>Why does God permit the scorching of the sun to come to us? Why does He allow difficulties to befall us? Brothers and sisters, this is the ultimate expression of the Lord's love&mdash;the cross. There is nothing which can cultivate our spiritual life as much as the cross; no trial can be better than the cross. When we heard the word of truth, we immediately accepted it with joy and consecrated ourselves to God. Perhaps we fancied that we were all right. In reality we overestimated ourselves. God purposely sent us trials and the cross so that we would see ourselves. Yet sometimes we end up having an argument with God because He acts contrary to our expectations. He tells us to go to places that we do not want to go to. He assigns us to work that we do not want to do. Therefore, we are dissatisfied. Inevitably, we misunderstand God, blame God, and have an argument with Him. Brothers and sisters, please remember that arguments bring us into dryness. All spiritual dryness has its beginnings in our controversy with God. If God gives way and we win, we will be doomed to wither away. Therefore, the cross is a test to us; it decides whether our life will end in richness or dryness. In other words, whether our life will be abundant or dry depends on how we deal with our argument with God. If we prevail and God yields, the only result for our life will be dryness. Therefore, we must never rejoice in our apparent victory or delight in our freedom. This merely points out the fact that our life is withering away and that our living will soon degenerate. The experience of many Christians testifies to this fact. Our life does not remain abundant when God yields. If there is an unresolved dispute, an unsolved problem, or an unclarified point between God and ourselves concerning His will, we must be extremely careful. If we are double-minded and not satisfied with God's arrangement, choosing the path which we consider to be good, we will not have to wait until the issue becomes apparent; we will begin to wither away immediately.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should not imagine that we can acquire something simply by listening to a message. God has to create an environment for us to actually feel the need for the word we hear. This will test whether we have accepted the word genuinely or superficially. God has to create an environment to show us that no teaching of the Bible can be ours without paying a price. For example, after we have listened to a word on endurance, God will arrange tribulation for us because "tribulation produces endurance" (Rom. 5:3). After we have heard a word on obedience, God will confront us with hardship so that we can learn obedience from the things which we suffer (Heb. 5:8). After we have heard a word on gentleness, God will bring us face to face with many irritating people and matters so that we will be "gentle toward all" (2 Tim. 2:24). After we have heard a word on faith, God will seem to hide Himself from us and take no notice of us when we call upon Him so that we will not "doubt in unbelief" but be "empowered by faith, giving glory to God" (Rom. 4:20). Each time we hear a word, something always seems to be waiting to test us. Brothers and sisters, if we can stand the test, the word will become real in us.</p><p>God will never allow us to simply listen to a message or consecrate ourselves; He must test us. He can only use the vessels which stand firm after the tests. Once an older sister, long in the service of the Lord, spoke to a young brother who was about to embark on the Lord's service, and said, "Every piece of bread that is consecrated to the Lord's hands must be broken before it can be distributed to others. Unbroken bread cannot multiply and will not sustain others' lives. We often consecrate ourselves to God yet hope in our heart: `Lord, I have consecrated myself to You, but please do not break me up!' We all want the bread to remain intact forever and stay permanently untouched. But every piece of bread in the Lord's hands must be broken. If you do not want to be broken, do not place yourself in His hands." Brothers and sisters, these are words of experience by one who knew the Lord. All the bread that is placed in the Lord's hands will be broken by Him. This is where the difficulty lies with many Christians. They listen to a sermon and joyfully say, "Lord, I consecrate everything to You." But when the Lord breaks them, they yearn to be delivered from their environment. Brothers and sisters, on the one hand, we are captured by God, but on the other hand, we are unwilling to be broken by Him. This is a struggling life. If we want to have an abundant life, we must allow God to send many trials to us.</p><h2 class="head1">LIFE IN THE DEPTHS</h2><p>Hosea 14:5-7 reads, "I will be like the dew to Israel;/He will bud like the lily/And will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon./His shoots will go forth;/And his splendor will be like that of the olive tree,/And his fragrance, like that of the trees of Lebanon./Those who sit under his shade will return;/They will revive like grain/And will bud like the vine;/His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon." In this passage, Lebanon is spoken of three times: once in relation to the lily, once in relation to the olive tree, and once in relation to the vine. Why is there such an emphasis on Lebanon? There is such an emphasis because the cedars on the mountain of Lebanon are very tall and the roots are very deep. The Bible uses the cedars of Lebanon to represent the tallest and biggest trees on earth; they also signify people who strike their roots deep. In this passage Lebanon is first spoken of with reference to the lily, then the olive tree, and finally the vine. For the Bible to speak in this way is profoundly significant. Let us briefly consider these verses.</p><p>Why is the lily linked to Lebanon? A lily is pure and beautiful. The lily that is referred to grows in the wilderness, not in a house garden. No gardener cultivates this lily; it depends solely upon sunshine, rain, and dew for sustenance. Christians are lilies of the valleys (S.S. 2:1); we rely entirely upon God's cultivation and maintenance. A pure and beautiful spiritual life is derived from uninterrupted fellowship with God. Hence, "he will bud like the lily/And will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon."</p><p>Why is the olive tree linked to Lebanon? In the eyes of man, an olive tree has no splendor at all. If we said that something has splendor like a peony plant, it would be easy to understand. But to compare splendor to an olive tree does not sound very appropriate. However, the Bible shows us that splendor to God is not a superficial splendor but genuine fruit. The olive tree bears oil-yielding drupe&mdash;its splendor is in its fruit. The splendor of a Christian is in the bearing of the fruit of the Spirit. This can be achieved only by going inward and striking roots in the depths. Therefore, his splendor is said to be as the olive tree and his fragrance as Lebanon.</p><p>Why is the vine linked to Lebanon? The verse says, "They will...bud like the vine." Have we ever seen the budding of a vine? Vine blossoms are tiny! Very soon after budding, the buds are turned into grapes. We never see vine blossoms in a flower vase. Why does the verse not say that the budding is like that of the peach tree or the chrysanthemum? This is because the budding which God honors is not something for man's appreciation but something that bears fruit like the vine. God requires a Christian to strike roots and bear fruit abundantly. That is why the verse says that they shall bud like the vine and their renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.</p><p>Lebanon is referred to three times&mdash;all for the purpose of drawing attention to a life in the depths. Although this life in the depths is a secluded life (like the lily in the valley), a life that is outwardly unattractive (like the olive tree), and a life that is not prominent (like the budding vine), it looks to God in simplicity and is capable of bearing much fruit. This is the kind of life a Christian should have. Yet it is impossible to have this kind of life unless one strikes deep roots; there has to be a regular daily exercise. We must set aside a little time every day to pray and study God's Word&mdash;reading and praying simultaneously in the presence of God. If possible, we should also appropriate some time to pray for the saints, the churches, and God's work. If a Christian does not read the Bible or pray every morning, he simply does not have any life in the depths. To strike roots is not a matter of words but is an actual practice in our daily life. At the beginning of this practice, one has to pay a price. May God's love attract and lead us into the depths day after day so that our roots may go down deeper and deeper.</p><p>In order to live a life in the depths, it is necessary to have direct and intimate fellowship with the Lord. Song of Songs 4:12 says, "A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse;/a spring shut up, a fountain sealed." What is spoken of here is a garden. According to the Bible, a garden is God's very first thought. A garden is not an ordinary plot of land; it is not for general- purpose planting. Neither is it a field, which is specifically for tillage. A garden exists solely for the purpose of beauty and enjoyment. In a garden there may be trees, but their purpose is not for wood. There may be fruit trees, but their purpose is not for fruit bearing. The importance of a garden is in its flowers. They are planted only for their beauty. Flowers are for the pleasure of the eyes. The description of the garden as "inclosed" means that it is not a public park which everybody has access to for enjoyment. Rather, it is inclosed exclusively for Christ. The inward beauty is to be seen and appreciated by Christ alone. This kind of life is not one that pleases men but one that only pleases Christ.</p><p>This life is "a spring shut up." The word "spring" can be translated "well." A well is for man's use. Although this well is for man's use, it is still under the restriction of the Lord. This life is also "a fountain sealed." A well is produced artificially, but a fountain is not. A well is for man, but a fountain is for God. A fountain stands for the joy and contentment we acquire before God. We cannot consciously divulge our experience to men, because it is a sealed fountain. A Christian should not consciously exhibit his beauty, pursuit, and spiritual experience to others. Everything should be silently sealed up for the Lord. Only this kind of life in the depths will satisfy the Lord's heart.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, our life is often too shallow, and a large portion of it is exposed on the surface. May the Lord grant us grace and do a deeper work in us through the cross so that we may strike roots and have a life in the depths to fulfill God's requirements and satisfy His heart.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE NORMAL MARRIAGE LIFE</h1><h2 class="head4">(A word given at a wedding on October 2, 1936)</h2><p>Prayer: Our Lord Jesus, we thank and praise You because all good things come from You. We acknowledge that all grace flows from You. Lord, we are gathered together this afternoon for the wedding of our Brother Yang and Sister Wu. We pray that You would bless this new couple and that they would see that everything is out of Your grace and Your love. May You open their eyes to see the immensity of their responsibility and to see how great a challenge it is to be a husband and how great a challenge it is to be a wife. Show them that the marital relationship can be a happy relationship and that it can also be a difficult relationship. Show them that the flesh cannot help them through such a relationship. Lord, give them the grace to learn how to be a husband and how to be a wife and to learn to glorify Your name daily. May this act today, this union today, glorify Your name. May it not bring shame to Your name or mockery from unbelievers. Lord, may the husband be a real husband, bearing the responsibility of the house, and the head in everything, and may the wife submit as a woman should in everything. Our Lord, may this couple express Your love, Your authority, and Your proper human virtues in their family. May You give them grace and bless them so that they may be blessed persons in their respective positions. Lord, be gracious to them. We commit the two of them into Your hand. May they glorify You daily, may the work of their hands glorify You, and may everything in this family glorify You. Bless them and bless all of us. In the name of the Lord Jesus, amen.</p><h2 class="head1">HUSBANDS LOVING WIVES AND<br />WIVES BEING SUBJECT TO HUSBANDS</h2><p>Let us read a very familiar passage: "But as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her" (Eph. 5:24-25). The brothers have been telling me for many days that I have to attend this meeting today and that I have to speak a few words. I prayed and considered what I should speak and how I should speak. God gave me these two very familiar verses.</p><p>Needless to say, this is a happy occasion and most people like to say "congratulations." While this, of course, is a fact, we also have to admit that there are troubles ahead. Before a person is married, he or she may have no trouble being a single person. But after a person is married, there is definitely trouble. Troubles for a single person are a possibility, but troubles for a married couple are a certainty. If we are not prepared to face these troubles, we will see one trouble after another. Troubles will perpetuate and propagate themselves. The first thing a Christian should realize is that no trouble within a family can be solved instantaneously.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO BE A GOOD HUSBAND AND A GOOD WIFE</h2><p>Brother Yang, do not think that you can be a proper husband in an instant. You may need three to five years to learn this. Sister Wu, I will say the same to you; it takes three to five years before you learn how to be a wife. Yet I must say that you have to learn. If you do not learn, you will never be able. Never think that you are born a husband or that you are born a wife. Many brothers and sisters think that they can become husbands and wives without learning. Some think that when a man earns forty to fifty dollars a month, has grown to over five feet in height, and is twenty-four or twenty-five years old, he is qualified to get married. There is no such thing. Unless you are determined to learn to be a wife, you will not succeed in becoming a wife. Unless you are determined to learn to be a husband, you will not succeed in becoming a husband. If a student does not have the heart to be a student, he cannot be a student. If an employee does not have the heart to be a good employee, he cannot be an employee. Similarly, if you do not have the heart to be a husband or a wife, you cannot be a husband or a wife. Many things come by accident; many things can be done mindlessly. But a good husband or good wife does not come by accident. Every good husband and every good wife become so through learning.</p><p>I am not preaching a sermon this afternoon. I only want to ask whether our brother and our sister have the heart to be a husband and a wife or whether they are merely trying their luck. There is no such thing as being fortunate by chance in marriage.</p><h2 class="head1">WIVES BEING SUBJECT TO HUSBANDS</h2><p>In these verses we have a biblical principle. Concerning the family, Ephesians 5 first exhorts the wife. Verse 24 is directed at the sisters, and verse 25 is directed at the brothers. I am not saying that everything related to the family first comes from the woman, but I can say that many things in the family come from the woman. Verse 24 says, "Let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything." If a sister wants to be married and she comes to me and asks, "Should I marry a certain person?" I will surely answer, "Can you be subject to him?" If you cannot be subject to him, you are not qualified to marry him. You can only marry him if you can submit to him. If you have never intended to submit to him in your heart, you should not be his wife and should not marry him. The day before yesterday, the brothers came and discussed this wedding with me and asked whether my words should be given before or after the wedding ceremony. Finally, we agreed that my words should be spoken after the wedding ceremony because we were afraid that the words would affect the wedding ceremony itself. Yet what I am saying is a fact. Marrying a person means that you are willing to offer yourself up and say, "I am willing to submit."</p><p>A fleshly man cannot submit. If you are of the flesh, you cannot get married. Do not think that marriage is something for the flesh. You have to realize that only a spiritual person can marry. In the eyes of the flesh, submission is most difficult. But in the eyes of the spirit, every time you are not submissive, you suffer a wound. If you do not submit, you can give yourself some breathing space, but you will be inwardly wounded.</p><p>Once a person asked me, "Why should wives be subject to their husbands?" I do not know. I do not know why wives should be subject to husbands. I only know that the God whom I serve says that wives should be subject to their husbands. I do not know why it is right to do this. I only know that wives should be subject to their husbands. One thing I do know: If a wife is subject to her husband, she always brings in spiritual blessing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE</h2><p>Here we may ask a question: What is submission? Ephesians 6:1 is Paul's word concerning parents and children. He told the children, "Obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right." It is interesting to note that 5:24 uses the words "be subject" or "submit," while 6:1 uses the word "obey." A wife submits to her husband, whereas a child obeys his parents. There is a great difference. What does it mean to submit? Submission is a matter of attitude, a matter of the spirit. What does it mean to obey? Obedience is a matter of the conscience, a matter of outward behavior. Submission is inward, whereas obedience is outward. Suppose your husband tells you that he wants to eat at twelve o'clock, yet you like to eat at half-past twelve. You realize that wives should submit to their husbands, so you set the table at twelve. But how do you do it? Do you make a great deal of noise setting the table? Have you readied the meal by twelve? Yes, you have. But are you submitting? No, you are not. In God's eyes this is obedience; this is not submission. Obedience is carrying something out; it is accomplishing a task. God did not say that wives should obey. If God had said that wives should obey, then wives should do whatever their husbands want them to do. What God asks from wives is submission. Submitting means to be meek and nonresistant. It does not necessarily mean obedience. For example, many sisters among us have unsaved husbands. The Lord is telling you to submit to your husband, not to obey him. If he asks you to go to a dance hall and you go with him, you are obeying, not submitting. What does it mean to submit? Submission is a matter of the heart, an inward matter, a matter of the spirit, whereas obedience is outward and superficial. Do you see the difference?</p><p>Then how do we distinguish the difference? Often wives can disobey their husbands yet at the same time be very submissive. I know of a brother who is not too young; he is in his twenties. When the Bible says that children should obey their parents, it means little children not adults. The father of this brother asked him to do something which a Christian cannot do. When many people obey, they do not submit. But this brother was wonderful; he submitted, but he did not obey. Listen carefully to this word: Submit but not obey. This is a very important word. His father forced him to do something that a Christian cannot do. What could he do? If he did not do it, he would be disobeying, but he had to submit. What could he do? He said, "Father, I wish I could do it, but I cannot." He knelt down before his father, and said in tears, "I wish I could do this, but I really cannot do it." Although he did not obey, he was very submissive. How many times have you said that you wish you could do something? Whether or not you can is a different question. But wishing that you could is submission. I like the expression "I wish I could." I wish is submission, whereas I could is obedience. Every one of us should be submissive. Not only should our sister submit, but also every brother and every sister should submit as well. We should all submit to one another, and no one should have a hard, rebelling, or insubordinate attitude. Often we may do something unwillingly and reluctantly. This is insubordination. We should all learn to submit from our heart.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SUBMISSION OF THE WIFE<br />BRINGING IN BLESSING TO THE FAMILY</h2><p>The husband's demands on the wife are not always that pleasant. Once I was a guest at a brother's house. There was a constant difference of opinion in the house. One person wanted to do one thing, and the other person wanted to do another thing. But the wife in the house was very submissive. Although there were differences in opinion, she was very submissive. Although she did not follow her husband's opinion, she was still very submissive and gentle in her attitude. She said to her husband in a very gentle way, "I cannot do this." Although she did not obey, she was very gentle in her attitude, and the family was a very harmonious one. The cushion of a family is the woman. The floor beneath us does not make any noise because the carpet cushions it. The cushion of a family is the gentleness of the woman. Once we have such a cushion, there will not be much noise in the family. It is true that an unsaved husband may not allow you to be baptized or bind up your hair. But sisters, when you have a husband that does not allow you to do these things, what attitude will you take? Will you say in your heart that you wish you could obey his word but that you cannot? I can tell you honestly that after being a Christian for many years, I have often failed to obey God. Yet God disciplines me and shows me something, and I still fear my God. I have not succeeded in doing many things, but I still fear God; I am still fearful before Him. I wish I could obey. Of course it is another thing when God makes us able to obey. I say this to show you God's demand for us today. There is one element that will keep a family in peace: submission in the sisters.</p><h2 class="head1">LOVE IN THE BROTHERS</h2><p>On the other hand, the brothers have to love; they have to love their wives. Verse 25 is after verse 24. In a family, after the wife submits, the demand is on the husband to love. A husband's love is something active; it is manifested in making provisions for many things. This is not a passive love but an active love. The husband has to actively assume the headship in the family; he has to make arrangements and provisions, provide protection, and take up the responsibility in the family. The ugliest thing in this world is finding a wife who is not submissive. It is also very ugly finding a husband who does not know how to be the head.</p><h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING THE POSITION THAT GOD HAS ORDAINED</h2><p>During these days, two or three brothers have come to me to ask about marriage. I said that there are four kinds of marriages in this world. Only one of the four is good; the other three are bad. The first kind is for a man to marry a woman, that is, for a proper man to marry a proper woman. This is the best kind. The second kind is not as good, which is for a "woman" to marry a woman, that is, for a submissive man to marry a submissive woman. The third kind is for a man to marry a "man," that is, for a responsible man to marry a responsible woman. The fourth kind is for a submissive man to be married to a responsible woman; it will end up being a terrible family. Such a family is hopeless; nothing can be worse than this kind. I thank the Lord that God's ordination is always wonderful. He ordains a man to be a man. The man has to love and actively take up the responsibility of the family. He has to make arrangements for everything in the house. God loves to see a man be a man. He hates to see a man looking like a woman. The woman should submit. God wants the woman to submit. Submission is in a woman's nature; it is the woman's nature to submit. This is very important. Brother Yang, you can never say to your wife, "Why can't I do what you can do?" You can say this anywhere else, but you cannot say this in the family. You can never say to your wife, "Why can't I do what you can do?" You have to remember that you cannot do what she can do. Similarly, she cannot do what you can do. A wife cannot say to the husband, "Why can't I do what you can do?", and the husband cannot say this to the wife. If you can do what your wife can do, you have become a woman already, and you have not stood on the position that God has ordained for you. A wife cannot say this to her husband, and a husband cannot say this to his wife. This is God's ordination.</p><p>May the Lord bless our brother and our sister and show them their responsibilities. You may say, "If I had known that it would be that troublesome, I would not have come this far." This is why I told you earlier that you cannot have a family unless you are spiritual; you will not be able to make it. Many people think that it is a simple thing to have a family. But I must tell you that a family will be an acid test to you. It will show what you can and cannot do. May the Lord bless our brother so that he can love his wife and take up his responsibility to protect, arrange, provide, supply, and be the head of the family. At the same time, may the Lord bless our sister so that she can become a genuine wife and submit in a genuine way. If we all do this, many of the problems in our families will be eliminated, and many blessings will be ushered in.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE DIFFERENCES<br />BETWEEN THE HUSBAND AND THE WIFE</h2><p>There is one final word. Today is the first day for you to begin to deal with your problems together. Do not misunderstand, this is not the first day for you to take a nice walk in the park. If you learn your lesson well, perhaps in five years you will have a wonderful family. What is a honeymoon? A honeymoon is the beginning of days of suffering. When will you begin to have some sweet days? If you deal with the differences between the husband and the wife properly, you may have sweet days after five years. But you have to begin to learn before you can expect those days to come. You have to put in some effort before you learn.</p><p>Once again, may the Lord bless the two of you and pour down His blessings upon you, and may you be dealt with and learn your lessons day by day. May the Lord bless both of you.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">A PERFECT FAMILY LIFE</h1><h2 class="head4">(A talk given on October 6, 1936,<br />at the wedding of Brother Ping and Sister Bau)</h2><h2 class="head1">ADJUSTING THE DIFFERENCES<br />BETWEEN HUSBANDS AND WIVES</h2><p>Every time a brother and a sister are married, I have to say something. It is a little hard for me to speak tonight because I spoke a word just a few days ago. I am here again after only a few days. It seems too soon for me to speak again on this subject. We have mentioned one thing again and again among us; perhaps, it is good to mention it again today. I have said over the past few years that we should not consider marriage to be nothing but happiness. If our hope is too high, our disappointment will become great. Brother Ping and Sister Bau, this may be the beginning of happy days, but there are surely days of suffering ahead. It seems that the word suffering is not a very appropriate word for an occasion like today. Perhaps I should say that all of the days ahead may not be happy ones. A few days ago I said that happiness will come after five years. Two years ago I met a family in Hangchow. Perhaps I can say that it was an ideal family, the best that I have seen. I asked the brother, "It seems to me that you have an ideal family, but at what point did your family become so ideal? Did it start from the day that you were first married, or did it begin sometime afterward?" He wondered what I meant, so I said, "I somewhat hold to the notion that a happy family life begins five years after the marriage. The honeymoon is the beginning of bitter waters; the waters do not turn sweet until later." In the evening we sat and talked in the courtyard. He was silent for a while and then suddenly jumped up and said, "You are right. At the beginning there was quite a lot of friction and noise between the two of us. Later it went away." During the past few days, I have met with Brother Ping a few times and Sister Bau also. They have bought their wok, their dishes, their broom, and their towels. But tonight I will ask you to bring home one more thing. If you do not bring this home, you cannot form a real family. You have to bring this home before your family can become a family. This one thing is the adjustment of the differences between the husband and the wife.</p><p>Formerly you both lived as individuals, and you were free to do whatever you wanted. But now your tent has been nailed down; the stakes are there, and something binds you. From now on there is another person in your life and living. The two are together and have become one. The Chinese have a saying: "To make two become one." If there is only one person, nothing will happen; there is no need for harmony if there is only one person. Oneness is the representation of harmony. The ultimate expression of harmony is oneness. Therefore, it is right to say, "To make two become one." But this is exactly where the problem lies. In the beginning everything was well between Adam and Eve because God made Eve out of Adam and gave her back to Adam. The two became one. They were one becoming two and two becoming one again. The problem today, however, is that Sister Bau did not come out of Brother Ping. The first part of the story is missing; only the second part is present. Our wedding meeting is only the second half&mdash; putting together two persons with different lives, different educational backgrounds, different upbringings, and differences in everything. If we merely put the two together, they are still two. Only when the two become one will the family be free from trouble. If the two cannot become one, the family will never be a success. You can do without all the miscellaneous things in a family, but you cannot do without this one thing.</p><p>You may ask me whether I have the assurance and the way to deal with the differences between husbands and wives. Brother Ping and Sister Bau, are you ready? You have to start picking up this matter immediately. This is one item of furnishing that you must have. From now on, you will see each other more, and you will also rub each other more. The question is whether or not there is oil in your rubbing. It may be difficult to find such a thing among the unbelievers or in the world. But thank the Lord that we are Christians, and it is easy to find this. Some among us today are not yet believers, and it is impossible to find this among them. But we are believers, and we can consider this matter from God's view. God has divided all people into two categories: those who are in Adam and those who are in Christ. If our brother and sister remain in their position in Christ, this couple, this family, will never run into trouble. But if they live in the other realm, if they live in Adam, it will be impossible to not get into trouble as a couple and as a family. We should never think that as long as the woman manages the home well and the man keeps his job, the family will be kept together. Just as spirituality is needed in a meeting, spirituality is needed in the family as well. Just as the meeting life has much to do with our spirituality, the family life also has much to do with our spirituality.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO DEAL WITH DIFFERENCES<br />BETWEEN HUSBANDS AND WIVES</h2><p>I have seen many families. I have been a guest in at least a hundred to two hundred homes. Of course, the number of families I have contacted exceeds this number. Many people think that a golden era will come after they are married and that they will have a wonderful life and family. But after three days, the husband discovers that his heavenly angel is just an ordinary girl, and the wife discovers that her imaginary hero is just one from among two hundred million Chinese. If a couple lacks the calibrating factor, what will be the result? What will happen after one month, two months, a year, or two years? If they were given the choice again, they would say that they would be the last ones to get married. Many regrets and thoughts of change occur because a couple did not adjust their differences at the beginning of their marriage. Therefore, I will speak a little on the adjustment of differences.</p><h2 class="head1">REALIZING THAT GETTING MARRIED<br />IS TAKING UP A JOB</h2><p>A husband has to set his mind on becoming a husband, and a wife has to set her mind on becoming a wife. Many husbands become husbands in a mindless way; they have no intention of living like a husband. Likewise, many wives become wives in a mindless way; they have no intention of living like a wife. They bump into each other, and one happens to become the husband, while the other happens to become the wife. If you want to be someone's husband or wife, you have to do it intentionally. You have to be a husband or wife consciously and conscientiously. Nothing in this world can be accomplished in a haphazard way. Even if you want to be a nanny or a rickshaw driver, you can succeed only if you do it intentionally and conscientiously. No one can succeed in being a husband or a wife in a mindless or haphazard way. Once, a brother and a sister were about to be married, and they asked me for a word to symbolize marriage. I said that marriage is like taking a job. It is a job to be a husband, and our brother is here to take this job. It is also a job to be a wife, and our sister is here to take this job. If you do not regard being a husband as a job, you cannot be a husband, and if you do not regard being a wife as a job, you cannot be a wife.</p><h2 class="head1">ALLOWING CHRIST TO BE THE LORD IN EVERYTHING</h2><p>The wife should never think that her husband will have the same opinion as she does. You may as well drop this dream now, because tomorrow you will wake up from this dream. Perhaps, you have awoken from it already. Perhaps, while the two of you were shopping the last few days, you awoke from that dream. The wife cannot expect her husband's opinion to be the same as hers, and the husband cannot expect his wife's opinion to be the same as his. You have to remember that your husband is an individual person, and you have to remember that your wife is an individual person. You must be prepared to accept this fact. Then what should you do? Many people consider that the only way is through compromise; they step back a little and close their mouth. Suppose you want to buy something red, and I prefer green. Since there is this difference, I let you choose the red and give up the green. But please consider that only the most foolish woman in the world would allow her husband to step back and shut up. He may be stepping back, but in his heart he is secretly saying, "I let her have her way this time, but..." You should never think that you have gained the upper hand. You have just put a hole in your boat with a nail. Nothing may leak out, but something will surely come in. The solution does not involve retreating or stepping back.</p><p>Thank the Lord that you are Christians, and it is easier to deal with this matter. This is not a matter of stepping back or giving way. You should allow the Lord to say what you should do. You should let the Lord be the "bad man." You do not have to allow your husband to be a "bad man," nor do you have to allow your wife to be the "bad man." Let the Lord be the "bad man." As the husband, you should put your proposal aside, and as the wife, you should put your proposal aside. Both the husband and the wife should put their proposals aside and together consider what the Lord is saying. If the Lord says to choose red, neither will have anything more to say. Christ must be the Head of the household. Brother, you are not the head of your household. Sister, you are not the head of your household either. The Head of the household is Christ. Just as Christ is the Lord who is controlling you in your personal life and living, so Christ should also be the Lord who is controlling your family affairs. If your wife insists that something should be done one way, then you should ask whether or not she is assured that this is the will of the Lord. I am not saying that you should merely step back; I am saying that you should step back to God. Those who fear God will not fabricate God's will. If she does not know God's will in the matter, you may be able to say, "I know what God's will is." However, if you do not know God's will either, you should say nothing and buy neither the red thing or the green thing.</p><h2 class="head1">AVOIDING IRRITATION OR PROVOKING ANGER</h2><p>The family is the place where one can easily become irritated. I believe no place on earth irritates a person more easily than the family. One common problem in the family is that some husbands complain that their wives have a quick temper, while the wives complain that their husbands have caused them to have a quick temper. Or the wives complain that their husbands have a quick temper, while the husbands complain that their wives have caused them to have a quick temper. We have to deal with this matter properly. Every time something like this happens, you have to ask whether the other side provoked you or whether you provoked the other side. The one who loses his temper has sinned, but the one who caused the other to lose his temper has also sinned. If the husband is nice, quiet, and gentle but the wife is quick and impatient, there will be no peace in the family. A wife may be quick and impatient, but her anger is often aroused by her husband. Many people are impatient because others force them to be impatient. We often encounter problems in the family, and we believe that the blame belongs to the other person. However, we should not think in this way. We should ask whether we have contributed to the other person's blame. This kind of thought will help build a good family.</p><p>Let me give an illustration. Many wives complain that their husbands are not generous in spending money. Of the many wives that I have met, at least eighty percent have this thought. It is often true that the husband is hesitant in spending money; he does not buy the utensils, food, and clothes that are needed. However, you must realize that there is a reaction for every action in this world. There are two sides to everything in this world. On the one side there is action, and on the other side there is reaction. If you want your husband to spend money, you must not spend money. This is a fact. A man does not have to speak with his mouth; he can speak with his eyes, ears, or actions. The word protestant means one who protests. Every person is constantly protesting. Man's condition is in a constant state of protest. The wife may say, "My husband does not want to spend money. Therefore, since he will not spend money on what is necessary, I will spend more." The husband may then say, "If you decide to spend so much, I will spend even less." The husband protests by his actions. His holding back is a kind of protest, whereas the wife's spending is also a protest. They smile at each other when they meet, they are polite to each other, and they say nothing with their mouth, but when one of them does anything, the other does exactly the opposite. They do not agree with what the other is doing, so they do it the other way. Soon matters become worse, and they do not understand the reason for the change. Brother, you should not say that your wife is a spendthrift. She is so good at spending money because you will not spend money. Sister, you should not say that your husband is stingy or reluctant to spend money. He does not want to spend money, because you spend too much money. Both sides are maneuvering.</p><p>A family is often like the pendulum of a clock. One minute it is on one side, and the next minute it is on the other side. If you push it to one side, it will swing all the way to the other side. But if you put it in the middle, it will no longer swing. This is the way between the husband and the wife. If the husband puts the pendulum all the way to one side, he may be trying to hold his wife to one side, but the more he tries to hold her to one side, the more she will swing to the other side, and the whole family will be thrown into turmoil. The husband will push to one extreme, while the wife will push to the other extreme. This is where the problem lies. Brothers, please remember that this is where the greatest problem in a family lies; this is where husbands and wives fall most easily into arguments. If there is a problem in your family, you should immediately consider, "Have I provoked her in anything? What have I done or what attitude of mine has caused her to act this way?" Please remember that whatever she does may not be that serious. The more serious matter involves what you have done to affect her behavior. Behind all the arguments and problems in a family are the standoffs within the family.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2><p>When I visit others' homes, it is mainly for the purpose of acting as a reconciler. Although I am not that old, I have done a great deal of reconciling work. I often point out the reason for a couple's protests. One time I was a guest in a family. Both the husband and the wife were not young; they were middle-aged. At the table, one was speaking one way, and the other was speaking another way. After one said something, the other overturned what the first one said, and vice versa. This went on and on. The two of them did not know what they were doing. Yet as an outsider, it was very clear to me. Later, they turned to me and asked, "What is happening with the two of us? There is really nothing wrong with us. Yet we cannot say that we are all right. There is really nothing bad about us, yet we cannot say that there is anything good. There is nothing spiritually wrong with both of us. We do not hate each other. Yet neither do we love each other. What is happening with the two of us?" I told them, "You are trying to outmaneuver each other." They asked what I meant. I pointed out how they had been maneuvering. They laughed and agreed with me readily. Please remember that you have to pay attention to the matter of adjustment. You have to adjust yourself properly. Today is the wedding day for both of you. It is also the day of your inauguration into your jobs. As you live together, you will find that there are many wonderful days ahead of you. You have to commit everything into the Lord's hand. As the husband, you should not step back, nor as the wife should you step back. Let the Lord speak to you in everything. If you want to deal with this matter properly, you must not protest in attitude or in action. I hope that in five years, we will have another wonderful family. Someone said that any book published by the Shang-wu Printing Company had to go through twenty-three proofreadings. Perhaps five years from now, the two of you will have gone through your twenty-third "proofreading." I mean that you have to spend time to adjust yourselves. If you do not spend the time, you will be the same five or ten years from now. You will still be dragging along on your side while she drags along on her side. If you will deal with this matter properly, I hope that we will see a splendid family life in five years. May the Lord bless the two of you!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">EXPOSITION OF ROMANS 5:12&mdash;8:39</h1><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 5:12-21</h2><p>Romans 5:12-21 says that everyone in the world is a sinner. Man is born in Adam. A man becomes a sinner first, and then he sins. He does not sin and then become a sinner. He sins because he is already a sinner. Romans 1:1&mdash;5:11 speaks of the sins that man has committed; it deals with what man has done, not with what man is in himself. Romans 5:12-21 speaks of what a Christian is; it speaks of the inward constitution of a Christian. Our deliverance is through the cross. This passage of the Scripture says that the sins committed in Romans 1:1&mdash;5:11 are forgiven and that we will rejoice in eternity. However, this does not mean necessarily that our hearts can rejoice at present. Salvation and deliverance are two different things. Salvation refers to God's forgiveness of what we have done&mdash;our sins&mdash;and this is once for all. Deliverance refers to freedom from the power of sin, from what we are inwardly&mdash;our person&mdash;so that we are no longer under any bondage. This is something we can experience day by day and moment by moment.</p><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 6:1-11</h2><p>Romans 6:1-11 shows that God's way of deliverance is to put us into Christ. First, He terminates us. Then He gives us a new life. The way of deliverance is by death and resurrection. The starting point of deliverance is a revelation of our relationship with Adam; it is seeing that we are of Adam and in Adam and are hopeless sinners. All that we are is nothing but sin, and all that we can do is sin. We inherited everything that Adam was and had. This realization of our relationship with Adam and the fact of our hopelessness is the beginning of our deliverance. The realization of our deliverance also comes through a revelation of our relationship with Christ. God has "grafted" the believers into Christ. Through baptism we are "grafted" into the Lord's death, and through resurrection we are "grafted" into Christ's resurrection. This is like the grafting of the fruit tree; the poor tree is grafted into the good tree. A branch of the poor tree is first cut off and then grafted into the good tree. In this way, the poor branch is joined to the good tree and absorbs into itself the nature of the good tree. "Grafting" means the adoption of a new nature, while "crucifixion" is a discarding of the dried branches so that old branches will not grow again. We are grafted into Christ. Our old nature is crucified because we are joined to the death of Christ. We are delivered from the old nature through death. At the same time, we are joined to Christ through resurrection, through our union in life. This is why we have to reckon ourselves dead to sin. Our deliverance from sin is a reality.</p><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 6:12-23</h2><p>Romans 6:12-23 says that from this point on, the believers must consecrate themselves. Consecration means that we are no longer our own. We consecrate because we have died and resurrected. Consecration does not mean that we offer what we originally had to God. It is offering what He has accomplished in us. The result of this consecration is sanctification. Consecration means that we no longer take control of ourselves; rather, we allow God to take control of us. We no longer live; instead, Christ lives for us. If we allow God to take control of us and live for us, the new life will grow and the new nature will be manifested. How beautiful this is!</p><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 7</h2><p>Romans 7 speaks of a man who wants to do good by himself. This brings in trouble. Romans 6 shows that the old man and sin have been dealt with. Romans 7 speaks of the flesh trying to do good. Actually, God has no intention that man do good. His intention is that Christ live within us. He wants Christ to live instead of us, and He wants Christ to work instead of us. Hence, God has no intention that we act according to the law. We must be delivered from the law and not try to please God by keeping the law. The law is God's demand; it demands that man do good. But today, God is not after men who do good. He wants men to do things through the Holy Spirit. God wants us to accept Christ as everything. His intention is that we no longer sin and also that we no longer try to do good. If we do not try to do anything, we will be delivered from sin as well as the righteousness that is according to the law. When the old man dies, we are delivered from the law. When the new man lives, we belong to Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 8</h2><p>Romans 8 tells us how we belong to Christ and how He performs everything within us. Chapter six removes the sinner; it does not remove the sin. Chapter seven removes the flesh; it does not remove the law. Through the cross of Christ, our old man is removed and sin is made of none effect. Through the flesh of Christ, our flesh is gone and the law is made of none effect.</p><p>Chapters five through eight show on the one hand that we are in Christ and on the other hand that we are in Adam. They show on the one hand that we are in the Spirit and on the other hand that we are in the flesh. Romans 5:12-21 speaks of our being in Adam; this is an objective fact before salvation. Romans 6:1-11 speaks of our being in Christ; this is an objective spiritual fact after salvation. Chapter seven speaks of our subjective experience in the flesh. A man can understand the spiritual fact in Romans 6:1-11, but he will fail if he exercises the fleshly power in chapter seven. In chapter eight we find that the true power is the Holy Spirit.</p><p>In chapter seven we have the flesh and the law, but in chapter eight we only have the Holy Spirit. In chapter seven the law reveals God's will, but the flesh tries to do His will. In chapter eight the Holy Spirit is doing God's will. Now the Holy Spirit Himself has become a law. There are two great problems in chapter seven: (1) The law is not perfect, and (2) man is wrong in himself. In chapter seven we find two laws: the law of sin and the law of death. In chapter eight we find only one law: the law of the Spirit of life. Sin refers to what one does actively, whereas death refers to what one fails to do passively. On the active side, the law of sin relates to sin, whereas on the negative side, the law of death relates to God. Sin is our committing of transgressions, whereas death is our extreme weakness to do anything. The law of sin operates in us and causes us to sin, whereas the law of death operates in us and makes us powerless. The man in chapter seven first discovers the law of death and then the law of sin.</p><p>Doctrinally speaking, we have the law of sin and of death, but experientially speaking, we have sin and the mortal body. Man's sin has to do with his body. The body of sin in Romans 6:6 means that the body is under sin. Chapter six also speaks of the body of sin being unemployed. The sin in Romans 7:5 and 23 dwells in the body. This means that the law of sin dwells in the members. Romans 8:9-10 says that Christ dwells in us through the Holy Spirit. What is the result of these two indwellings? These indwellings occur within us at the same time, yet there is a difference between the work of the two indwellings. Chapter eight speaks of Christ saving our spirit before our body. Chapter seven shows a man who is indwelt by Christ, resulting in his inner man desiring God's will. At the same time, we see the evil in the mortal body. The righteousness referred to in Romans 1:1&mdash;5:11 is an "imputed" righteousness, whereas the righteousness after 5:12 is a "dispensed" righteousness. Romans 8:11 speaks of the Holy Spirit dwelling within us and giving life to our mortal bodies. According to a Chinese maxim, when one draws a dragon, he does not draw the eyes. Because the drawings are so life-like, there is the thought that once the eyes are "dotted in," the dragon will fly away. When the Holy Spirit is "dotted in" in us, the body flies away, and this same body becomes one with the Spirit. We have to wait for the full redemption of the body before we can allow Christ to live in us in full. However, even though the body is not yet redeemed, it no longer has to be a frustration to God's will.</p><p>Chapter six speaks of the body of death. Chapter seven says that a believer should not try to do good any longer, because he has a body of death. If we want to accomplish anything, we have to look to Christ. We have to believe that He is working, and we have to look to His working and believe that He has accomplished what He wanted to accomplish.</p><p>Chapter eight begins with "no condemnation" and ends with glorification; this is the subject of chapter eight. God will not be satisfied until He saves us all the way into glory. The result of man's fall is that he comes short of the glory of God, whereas the Lord has come to bring many sons into glory.</p><p>A man who lives in the flesh is a man who lives by the power of the flesh. With such a one, there are only natural power and the flesh. Chapter seven shows how weak a man in the flesh is. His weakness is proven by the fact that he cannot keep the law. Once God puts man into the Holy Spirit, he overcomes. Being in Christ is objective, whereas being in the Holy Spirit is subjective; the Holy Spirit dispenses all of Christ's accomplishments upon us and into us. Christ is our life, but the Holy Spirit makes us alive. What is the gospel? When the Holy Spirit descends, we have the gospel. The Father designed the plan of salvation; this gives us the hope of salvation. The Son accomplished salvation; this gives us the basis of salvation. The Holy Spirit wrought this salvation into us; this gives us the fact of salvation. The Holy Spirit can only carry out His work according to Christ; He cannot do what Christ has not accomplished. The work of the Spirit is fellowship; therefore, He transmits what the Son has done to us. Everything that is in Christ becomes living when it is in the Holy Spirit. Since both Christ and the Spirit have come, why are believers still lacking in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit? The reason is that they have not experienced Romans 7 adequately. Our position is in Christ, but we are not aware of the corruption of the flesh. Therefore, we still live in Adam. The activities of the flesh put a man in the flesh and cause him to be no longer in the Spirit. Only after a man has become utterly disappointed with the flesh will he be in the Spirit. Whenever God's truth is separated from the Holy Spirit, it becomes the law. Whenever Christ's work is separated from the Holy Spirit, it becomes useless within man. A spiritual matter is living only when it is put into the Holy Spirit. Apart from the Holy Spirit, everything is dead (cf. John 15:5). In this world, only those who have lost hope in themselves will know the work of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Romans 8:1-4</h2><p>The "now" in verse 1 means that there is no condemnation for those who know their flesh and who are in Christ. Verse 2 says that we are no longer impotent (this is the meaning of "no condemnation" in verse 1). When we are in Christ and in the Spirit, we have two deliverances: (1) We are delivered from the law in Christ, and (2) we are delivered from the flesh in the Spirit. Verse 3 speaks of the law and the flesh and the Son of God becoming a sacrifice for sin. The first step is in Romans 1:1&mdash;5:11, in condemning sin in the flesh. The second step is in Romans 6:6. Romans 8:4 says that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk according to the spirit. God is after the righteousness that is according to the law and not the law itself. The righteousness of the law gains God's acceptance through the keeping of the law.</p><h2 class="head2">Romans 8:5-8</h2><p>Verse 5 speaks of being according to the flesh or being according to the spirit. In order to find out whether a man is according to the flesh or according to the spirit, all we have to do is look at the things he minds, whether they are of the flesh or of the Spirit. The thoughts of a man represent a man. Miss M.E. Barber said, "If Satan can control your thought life, he controls the major part of your life." If we are not delivered in our thoughts, we are not delivered from the flesh. Verse 6 says that the mind set on the spirit is life and peace. "Life" means that all spiritual truths become living in us, whereas "peace" means that we are above all circumstances and are not touched by anything. There is no more condemnation or struggling. We have to ask ourselves: How much of our life is fresh, and how much grace do we experience? The animal life only has creature activities. "It is not subject" is a matter of nature, while "neither can it be" is a matter of power (v. 7). As soon as we are delivered from the law, we are delivered from the flesh. How can we be delivered from the flesh? We are delivered from the flesh when we see that the law no longer has a demand on us and that we no longer have to do anything.</p><h2 class="head2">Romans 8:9</h2><p>Starting from verse 9, the flesh is finished, and we have the way to live in the Spirit and enjoy all that God has accomplished in Christ. Verse 9 speaks of the Spirit dwelling in us and of us being in the spirit. Our relationship with Christ is seen from the expression: "He...abides in Me and I in him" (John 15:5). What does it mean to be in the spirit? Every living creature has an environment which is the most optimal for its existence. Similarly, there is an optimal environment for every believer. This environment is the Holy Spirit. Christ has died in the flesh, and He now lives in the Holy Spirit. God has now put all of Christ's accomplished works and all truth in the Spirit. Because of this, all these works and truth have now become living. Apart from the Spirit, everything is dead. Whenever God's truth is separated from the Spirit, it becomes law. Whenever Christ's life is separated from the Spirit, it becomes letter. If Christ is separated from the Spirit, He becomes nothing but a man from Nazareth to us.</p><p>What kind of people live in the spirit? They are those who allow the Spirit to dwell within them. The Holy Spirit has been sent to us to live in us and to be our life. The Holy Spirit lives in us as a person, imparting to us the experience of the Lord Jesus. Many people know doctrinally that the Holy Spirit is a person, but experientially they do not know the Spirit as a person; they think that the Spirit is merely an influence. They do not realize that the Spirit dwelling in us is God dwelling in us. The Holy Spirit dwelling in us is God dwelling in us as a person. We have to believe God's Word, which says that the Holy Spirit dwells in us. Believers should offer themselves up so that the power of the Spirit can be made manifest. Once we know that the Spirit living in us is a person, we will lose our liberty. From that point on, we will not be our own; we will have the Spirit as a living person living within us. We must give Him the freedom to express His power and His everything through us.</p><h2 class="head2">Romans 8:10-12</h2><p>In verse 10, Christ and the Spirit mentioned in verse 9 are considered separately. Verses 1 through 11 cover the work of the Holy Spirit, which affects not only the spirit and the mind but also the body. The Spirit will give life to our mortal bodies. Verse 12 is a response to the preceding chapter. If a believer remains in the experience of chapter seven, he remains there by his own choice and not by necessity, for "we are debtors not to the flesh."</p><h2 class="head2">Romans 8:13-17</h2><p>Verse 13 says that if a man chooses to live by the flesh, he will die. This death may refer to the death in the millennium, that is, the losing of eternal life in the coming age. Verse 13 says, "By the Spirit you put to death..." Those who have received Christ are the children of God. Yet one has to be "led by the Spirit of God" before he can be a son of God. Being the "children" in the first part of verse 17 is unconditional, whereas being "heirs" in the second part is conditional; we have to "suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him."</p><h2 class="head2">Romans 8:18-39</h2><p>The glory in verses 17 and 18 refers to the glory in the millennial kingdom, whereas the glory in verse 30 is the glory in eternity. Verses 18 through 30 speak of the hope of redemption, which is the full redemption of the body and the spirit. Verses 31 through 39 begin with, "What then shall we say?" We can only offer praise.</p></body></html>
