We must all realize that the Christ in this book differs distinctly from the Christ in the four Gospels. In the Gospels we see a Christ who is gentle, tender, and mild; but in the Revelation we see a Christ whom we may describe as fierce. In the Gospels, the Apostle could lean upon Christ's breast, but in the Revelation, when John saw Christ, he immediately fell to the earth. The Christ we see in Revelation is One whose eyes are as a flame of fire and whose voice is as the sound of many waters. Why is there this difference? It is because, when we come to the Book of Revelation, the age has changed. Therefore, the aspect and attitude of Christ have also correspondingly changed.</P><P>In this Book of Revelation we have religion, but this religion differs from the religion in the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles. In all these books, the religion was the old religion, the Jewish religion. But here in the last book of the New Testament, religion takes on a new garb. It is no more the Jewish religion, but the Christian religion, the religion of Christianity. Thus, in the Book of Revelation, Christ is different and religion also is different.</P><P>In the seven epistles of the second and third chapters of this book we get a clear view of the new religion, Christianity. The Christian religion has become a real religion, and it has become so by steps. Here in these seven epistles we see five steps toward this new religion. Only two churches among these seven, Smyrna and Philadelphia, have nothing to do with religion. All the rest have very much to do with it, and with each there is a definite step taken towards its formation. There are five churches with five steps which together form the new religion of Christianity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1. WORK WITHOUT LOVE</H2><P>The first step towards this new religion of Christianity is an abundance of work for Christ without an intimate and personal love to Him. You may never have considered that an abundance of labor for the Lord could be something that would form a religion. You have probably thought that there is nothing wrong with working hard for the Lord. What is wrong with going to the mission field, teaching the Bible, helping people to know the Lord and be saved? The Lord recognizes all the work, as He did that of the church in Ephesus, but there is a danger. You may labor diligently and accomplish much for the Lord without an intimate and personal love for the Lord Himself.</P><P>In the recovery of the church life we must all be on the alert. We must work, we must labor for the Lord, but we must be careful that our work is balanced with intimate and personal love for our dear Lord. Indeed, we need to love Him more than we work for Him. Our love for Him must be more precious, more dear than the work we do for Him. We must not be so concerned for what we accomplish for Christ as much as to what extent we love Him. We need an intimate and personal love for the Lord Jesus, and this love must be the first love, the best love. The word translated "first" in reference to first love (Rev. 2:4) is the same as that translated "best" in reference to the best robe (Luke 15:22). Hence, first love is best love, and this is the love we must maintain continually. We may forget to work for Him, but we must never forget to love Him in the first and best way. He is primarily not our Master, but our Bridegroom. Hallelujah! We must never lose sight of our Lord Jesus as our lovely, precious, and present Bridegroom. To serve Him is secondary; to love Him is primary.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_076.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_078.html">Next</a> </body></html>
