   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO DEALINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first two chapters of Philippians we see the fellowship, the spiritual traffic, between the apostle and the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have pointed out, the third chapter is concerned with two kinds of dealing the dealing with the soul and with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Philippians 3, to deal with our soul in a proper way is to count as loss, even as refuse, all religious, philosophical, and cultural things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may not realize that such things have been wrought into our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our soul is not only filled with these elements, but even constituted of them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These things may be useful for society, but they are damaging to the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are rocks occupying room in our being that belongs to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although you have received Christ, you may confine Him to your spirit and not allow Him to spread out into your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In your soul there may be no room for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Your soul may have been filled with the things of religion, philosophy, and culture, in particular with your national characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both in the Orient and the West, I have seen that every saint has been constituted of these things in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But Paul was rescued by counting these things to be refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No longer would he treasure anything of religion, philosophy, or culture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to gain Christ, he was absolute in counting other things to be refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we have indicated, in Philippians 3 Paul deals with the body as well as the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He points out that the believers should not have excessive enjoyment in physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After writing chapter three, Paul s burden was discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, chapter four serves as a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this conclusion, Paul does not present any additional main points.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The contents of chapter four are related to what Paul has already written and are a confirmation of these points.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, the points in chapter four function as a charge to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Philippians 4:1 says, So then, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The words so then indicate that what Paul is about to say is a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here Paul speaks of the brothers as the beloved and longed for, his joy and crown.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These words indicate that Paul was filled with emotion, full of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Twice he uses the word beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After referring to the believers as his beloved, he again addresses them as beloved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The believers were his joy within and his crown without.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joy is inward, whereas a crown is manifested outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this verse Paul was saying that the believers were both his inward happiness and his outward glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 4:1 Paul charges the believers to so stand firm in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The expression so stand means to stand in a particular way, in the way presented in the foregoing chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this verse Paul was urging the believers in Philippi to stand in the way he had shown them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THINKING THE SAME THING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 2 Paul continues, I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This verse indicates that these two sisters were dissenting from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were not of the same mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, there was the exhortation to strive together with one soul for the gospel 1:27 , to be joined in soul, thinking the one thing 2:2 , and to have the same mind to pursue after Christ 3:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to verse 3, these were very good sisters who had been helpful to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul says of them that they contended with me in the gospel, with both Clement and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Greek word rendered contended is an athletic term; it means to labor with, to strive together for, to wrestle in company with, as a team of athletes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These sisters were a help to Paul and the other workers, contending with them in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, even these sisters needed help to be one by thinking the same thing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the foregoing chapters, to think the same thing is related to pursuing Christ in order to gain Him and enjoy Him in full.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Euodias and Syntyche were not pursuing Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Any who are tempted to be dissenting should heed Paul s word to these sisters to think the same thing.</S>
