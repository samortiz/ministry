	 <h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS AND THE DEVIL</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:13; see also Acts 26:18).</p>
<p>God saves believers out of the devil&rsquo;s kingdom and delivers them out of the authority of darkness so that they are no longer tyrannized by him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:18).</p>
<p>Believers are begotten of God and have the life of God. This life protects believers from the devil&rsquo;s attacks. As long as we live by this life, the devil cannot touch us.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;You have overcome the evil one&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:13, 14).</p>
<p>Those who belong to God and have His life can overcome the devil. If we let God&rsquo;s word of life abide in us and accomplish its life-giving effect in us, we will overcome the evil one, the devil.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Deliver us from the evil one&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:13; see also John 17:15; 2 Thes. 3:3).</p>
<p>We not only have God&rsquo;s life and word within us to enable us to overcome the devil, but God Himself protects and delivers us from the devil. The Lord prayed for this, and we also should pray that God would protect us and deliver us from the devil, the evil one.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 10:19; see also Rom. 16:20).</p>
<p>The Lord has given us the authority to tread upon the devil and his angels and to overcome their power. They have power, but the Lord has given us authority. Authority is higher than power. Authority controls power, just as a policeman controls powerful cars with his authority.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:11).</p>
<p>We can overcome the enemy because of the Lord&rsquo;s blood. The devil often points out our sins and accuses us, but we must rely on the Lord&rsquo;s blood to overcome his accusations. We also can overcome the enemy because of the word of our testimony. When we testify that the Lord has overcome the devil and has already destroyed him, the devil is defeated. Finally, we can overcome the enemy when we do not love our soul-life even unto death, that is, to not love or care for ourselves even to the point of death.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;In My name they will cast out demons&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 16:17).</p>
<p>We can cast out demons in the Lord&rsquo;s name. We cannot cast out demons by our own power and strength but only in the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Neither give place to the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:27).</p>
<p>We cannot give place to the devil. Once we give him a little place, he will work to harm us.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;We are not ignorant of his schemes&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 2:11).</p>
<p>We should not be ignorant of the devil&rsquo;s schemes. We are fighting against him, and he is an enemy who is full of schemes. Therefore, in order to overcome him, we must not be ignorant of his schemes.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Be sober; watch...Withstand, being firm in your faith&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 5:8-9; see also James 4:7).</p>
<p>With respect to the devil, we must be sober and watchful, withstanding him by being firm in our faith. We cannot be loose; we must be watchful.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:11).</p>
<p>In order to stand against the devil, we must put on the whole armor of God. An individual Christian cannot wear the whole armor of God; it must be worn by the church. We must fight the devil&rsquo;s authority of darkness with all the saints. The warfare in Ephesians 6 is a warfare between the church and the devil&rsquo;s authority of darkness; therefore, the armor in Ephesians 6 must be worn by the church. If we live in the church, the Body of Christ, and put on the whole armor of God with all the saints in order to stand against the devil, we will overcome him and bring in the kingdom of God.</p>
