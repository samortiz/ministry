<p>The training of the young full-timers is needed. Whatever we do, we should not be that confident or contented. We still need to hold an attitude that we are learning. We like to be improved and adjusted. I hope that the brothers who have the burden to take care of the training of the young full-timers do it in this way. I told the saints in Taiwan from the very beginning that we were in the &ldquo;lab.&rdquo; We needed to try things to see what would happen. I did not have the confidence that anything was absolutely right or would really work. If it did not work, we should change and improve. Thank the Lord that most of the things we raised up did work so well. I hope that you brothers would take the same kind of attitude and have the same kind of spirit to do the trainings of the full-timers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning How to Contact the Lord</h2>
<p>The next very crucial thing we have to train the full-timers in is that they must learn how to contact the Lord. Every day they must have a proper time to contact the Lord. Everyone must have a private time to pray to the Lord, to have a direct, private, personal contact with the Lord Himself. In our contact we should not pray for so many things, but we need to open to Him to be enlightened, exposed, and judged. We need to exhort them to have some direct dealing with the Lord. This is the way for them to grow up in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Getting into the Word</h2>
<p>We must also help them get into the Word. The best reference books for the young ones to study are the Recovery Version with the notes and the Life-study Messages. If they still have time, they can get into the cross references. If they use this material, they will get into the proper knowledge of God&rsquo;s New Testament revelation. We must train the saints to get into this material to have themselves equipped with the proper understanding of God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up Their Character</h2>
<p>One basic thing we like to train our young people in is their character. We have a little book with thirty aspects of human character. It is worthwhile to train them in this way. I consider this as something basic. One morning in Taipei I dropped in on the full-timers for about one hour, charging them to build up their character. They were wondering what I meant. Then I began to point out specific things. One brother&rsquo;s necktie was the wrong color, and the way he put it on was wrong and loose. I told them to look at the way they combed their hair, the way their shoes were not shined, and the color of socks they put on. I told them that not wearing a necktie was a sign of their bad character. Whatever such a person says to others will not be regarded. In a bank every teller is required to dress quite well because he is representing the bank in his contact with the public. If the young ones who go out are properly dressed with a proper haircut and are very polite, neat, and straight, they are the right persons. The listeners respect this kind of person and regard him regardless of what he says. Whatever he says, they want to listen to him. Another person may wear a blue shirt with a very strange necktie that does not match in color. His tie distracts people&rsquo;s eyes. When he talks to them, they have no heart to listen. They would only be distracted to look at the tie he is wearing. This becomes a big embarrassment to his speaking.</p>
<p>The full-timers in Taipei were convinced by this fellowship and everyone looked much better the next day. They all even improved the combing of their hair. Some began to comb their hair in a good way but later their old character came back. I told the saints that if they did not build up their character, they could never read the Bible properly. A loose person in character could never understand the Bible in the right way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fleeing Youthful Lusts</h2>
<p>We also have to warn them strictly and strongly to not be alone with a member of the opposite sex. Their contact should only be for the work or other necessary purposes. They must be very careful and we must warn them. We have seen a number of young people who had a good beginning get snared by their youthful lusts. The unrestrained contact between the males and females in this present age is terrible. It is an abomination in the eyes of God. The great amount of fornication in the United States frustrates the Lord&rsquo;s blessing this country. For one young male to stay in a room with another female is absolutely wrong. To travel together is also against the principle. We even prohibit the young trainees from giving a ride to someone their age of the opposite sex. Then they will be preserved.</p>
<p>The four items above are the basic things. Of course, they also need some fellowship on how to trust in the Lord. I do not feel that it so necessary to fellowship with them concerning how to preach the gospel. The simple way for the full-timers to take is to learn how to present the printed pages of the ministry and to speak them. If you want to train them in the skill of teaching and preaching, teach them how to use these printed pages.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_044.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 45</div><br></body></html>
