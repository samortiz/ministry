Confessing the Lord</H2><P>The robber not only rebuked the other robber and confessed that he himself was a sinner, but he also confessed that the Lord Jesus had no sin. Please read the last part of verse 41. "But this Man [meaning the Lord Jesus] has done nothing amiss." He seemed to be saying, "The three of us are being punished together. Two of us are robbers, and this manner of execution is indeed just; but this Man, Jesus Christ, did not commit sin. None of the things He did was bad; everything was proper and most holy. But He is being punished together with us sinners. What does this mean? Robbers should be nailed to the cross. But should this One who is not a robber also be nailed to the cross? We are condemned because of our evil conduct, but should this One, whose conduct is the best, be condemned also? We sinners deserve death. There is no argument about that. But this Man, the most holy and most perfect One, why does He deserve death? The guilty ones should die. This is reasonable. But what is the reason for this guiltless One to die? Sinners should perish. This is most justifiable. But what does it mean for the sinless One to suffer the pain of perdition? We robbers have nothing to say about our dying; but why does He, the Christ of God, have to go through the same fate as we?" This really is an amazing question! Truly, no one in the world could answer it! We must see what the Bible says. "For while we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly" (Rom. 5:6). "While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (v. 8). "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree" (1 Pet. 2:24). "For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous" (1 Pet. 3:18). These verses in the Bible tell us why Christ died. He died on behalf of sinners. He died in substitution for your sins and my sins. "Substitution!" "Substitution!" Please take note of this word. There is no other word more important than this. Without substitution, there would be no gospel. Without the substitution, there would be no salvation. Without the substitution, there would be no need for preaching. If Christ had not died in substitution for sinners, I would not believe in Christ, and I would also urge you not to believe in Him. If He had not died on our behalf, we would still have to bear our own sins, and we would still have to perish. What use would it be for us to believe in Him? But thanks and praise be to God! Although His Son has no sin, God gladly gave Him up for us sinners. On our behalf Christ bore all the punishment of our sins and died upon the cross so that whenever we believe in Him, we will have eternal life and not perish.</P><P>It is very meaningful to see this robber speaking about the Lord Jesus' guiltless punishment. He saw the Lord's death; he also acknowledged that the Lord is sinless. But why must a sinless person die? He implicitly acknowledged that Christ's death was on his behalf. He believed in the salvation of the cross. He believed in the Lord Jesus' substitutionary death. For this reason he was saved. My dear sinners, there is only one way to be saved: believe in the crucified Lord Jesus Christ. If you believe that He has died for you on the cross, you will immediately have eternal life. You have sinned; you should perish. Sin and the consequence of sin are two things that cannot be separated. Once you sin, there is a consequence of sin, a punishment: hell and perdition. If you have not sinned, there is nothing to say. If you are altogether righteous and holy, who can punish you? If you have sinned, the punishment of sin will surely fall upon you. Do you want to perish? If you want to perish, then I have nothing to say; but if you do not want to perish, then salvation is here. The sinless Lord Jesus Christ has died in your place upon the cross, bearing all the consequences that you should have received for your sin. Are you willing to believe in Him right now? "He who believes has eternal life" (John 6:47).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Prayer</H2><P>The robber not only believed the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus, but he also prayed out from his faith a most sincere prayer. He prayed, "Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom" (Luke 23:42). Let us look at another verse from the Bible, Romans 10:13. "For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." He called on the Lord; therefore, he was saved. Let us look at the next verse, verse 14. "How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?" After seeing this, we know that faith comes before calling. Without faith, there would be no prayer. Prayer issues from faith. Prayer is the ultimate expression of faith. Faith is the cause; prayer is the effect. We need to pay attention to one thing: although the robber rebuked his companion, he was not saved because of his rebuking. Although this robber confessed that he was a sinner, he was not saved because of such a confession. Although this robber prayed and asked the Lord Jesus to save him, his salvation was not due to his prayer. You must remember that repentance cannot save a sinner; confession cannot save a sinner; praying cannot save a sinner. A sinner is saved because of one thing only: believing in the Lord Jesus Christ's substitutionary death, that is, believing that the Lord Jesus has died for him on the cross. Before this robber prayed, he had the faith; he had accepted the Lord Jesus as his Savior. His prayer was just a spontaneous calling that issued from his faith. One who believes in the Lord's substitutionary death spontaneously cries out to the Lord for salvation. His salvation is not due to calling but due to his believing. Dear sinners, do not trust in your works. Your works cannot save you. Even good works such as repentance, confession, and prayer will not save you. If you want to be saved, please accept with faith the Lord Jesus as your personal Savior, believing that He has borne all of your sins' punishment on the cross. Once you believe, you are saved. Once you believe, you have eternal life. Will you believe?</P><P>The robber thought that being saved is something in the future; therefore, he begged Jesus to remember him when He came into His kingdom (Luke 23:42). This is the salvation of the Old Testament. He realized that he had nothing good to be proud of, nor any righteousness to brag about; he could not ask the Lord to save him according to his own merit. He said to the Lord, "Remember me." He meant that he considered himself unworthy and unqualified, seemingly with not much hope for salvation. If the Lord Jesus would remember him, there was no need of anything else. Just to remember him once would be good enough. He knew all those who were remembered by God would receive exceedingly great grace. So he begged in such a way. Although what he asked for was not perfect, the Lord Jesus Christ did listen to him. The Lord promised him something that he had not asked for, something beyond his expectation. Oh sinners, the Lord is very willing to treat you this way. Do you want Him to treat you this way? There is not much time left! Eternal life or eternal death will soon be decided! Are you willing to take advantage of this crucial five minutes to believe in this Savior who has died for you? At this moment are you willing to call on His name with a believing heart and ask Him to save you? Alas! How great are our sins! How deep is our agony! How long is the final judgment! How terrible it will be! How dangerous is our present position! What confusion! If you do not call on Him now, when will you do so? If you do not come before God with tears and sorrow now and seek His salvation now, how long are you going to wait? I hope that you will quickly turn and be awakened right now. Please take a few minutes in silence now, bow your head, and pray to God. Ask Him to save you for the sake of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 06: The Christian (4) &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
