   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A NIGHT OF OBSERVATION UNTO JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Exodus 12:42 says, It is a night of observation unto Jehovah for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night unto Jehovah, an observation for all the children of Israel in their generations Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the night of the Passover, the children of Israel had satisfaction, rest, and joy, but they did not sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As this verse indicates, it was a night of observation, a night of watching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This implies that God was observing, watching, the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, as the Berkeley Version makes clear, both God and the children of Israel were watching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As God was observing and watching, His people were observing and watching also.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, that night was a night of observation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Exodus 12:42 says that this night was a night of observation unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The children of Israel were watching unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that they were cooperating with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God was doing everything necessary to rescue them from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was watching, and His people were watching unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we apply this to our experience, we see that our exodus was also a night of watching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the reason that in the New Testament we are warned not to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 13:11 says that now is the hour for you to be raised out of sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, in 1 Thessalonians 5:6 and 7 Paul says, So then, let us not sleep as the rest, but let us watch and be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For those who sleep, sleep in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As Paul says in the same chapter, we are sons of light and sons of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are not of the night nor of darkness v. 5 . If we are not alert spiritually, we turn the day into night, but if we are watchful and observant, even our night will be turned into day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To make an exodus from the world is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such an exodus takes place during a night of watching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God watches over us, and we must watch with God and unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The night of our exodus must be a vigil, and we must be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without such a vigil, no one can get out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christians who are slothful and sleeping cannot make an exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only those who are watchful, vigilant, and observant can come out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God watchfully exercises His sovereignty over our situation, and He commands us to be watchful unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then our night will turn into day, and we shall be rescued from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the New Testament we are charged not to love the world 1 John 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, it is possible for us to take this word in a very superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The picture in the Old Testament indicates that the exodus from Egypt should not be regarded superficially.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the night of the exodus, even God was watching and observing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The King James Version of 12:42 says that it was a night to be much observed unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This does not mean that it was a night for the observation of rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, it was a night of observing, of watching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God was watching and observing in order to bring His people out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His people had to cooperate with Him by watching unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They had to be watchful because they did not know at what time they would march out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By this we see that no sleepy ones or loose ones can have an adequate exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you want to make an exodus from the world, you need to be watchful, observant, and vigilant.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then you will know the right time to go out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BECOMING</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE ARMIES OF JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 12:41 we are told that all the armies of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt Heb , and in 12:51, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, 13:18 says, The children of Israel went up in martial array out of the land of Egypt Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Hebrew in 13:18 indicates that the children of Israel went out arrayed in ranks of five.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They did not go out of Egypt in a loose way; they marched out as an army.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the surrender of the Japanese army in 1945, I watched American soldiers march in rows of four through the streets of the Chinese city of Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How excited I was to see those young Americans in martial array!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By contrast, I have been very disappointed to see the looseness of certain young people in the United States today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we would make our exodus out of the world, we cannot be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Spiritually speaking, we must march out of the world in martial array.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everything concerning us must be strict, straight, and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against Satan and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For such a battle, we need to be in martial array, ready to fight against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Day by day the Christians in the church life need to be in martial array.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In everything we do we should be strict, straight, and corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only by being in the army corporately can we be in martial array.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The fact that we are to march out of the world as God s army indicates that it is not an easy matter to make our exodus out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Praise the Lord for this vivid portrait in the book of Exodus!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May this portrait make a deep impression upon us all.</S>
