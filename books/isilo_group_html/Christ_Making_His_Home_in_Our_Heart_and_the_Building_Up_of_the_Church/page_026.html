SPEAKING WICKEDNESS BUT BUILDING UP</h2>
<p>When we look at the earthen vessels instead of Christ, we feel that the saints are full of problems, and as a result, we dislike them, are bothered by them, criticize them, and judge them. In the end, we have nothing to enjoy and are full of criticism. We are accusing the brothers and sisters when we criticize them for this or that reason. If we look at the earthen vessels but do not look at Christ, the treasure, we will always be pointing a finger at others and speaking wickedness. As a result, words of death will spread among us and will infest the church.</p>
<p>The book of Isaiah says, &ldquo;If you remove... / The pointing of the finger and the speaking of wickedness... / Then your light will rise in the darkness, / And your gloom will be like midday&rdquo; (58:9b-10). In other words, the pointing of a finger, the finding of fault, the speaking of wickedness, and the spreading of death are done in darkness. You should check to see whether you feel bright within after you criticize the saints. You may think that you are bright within when you consider that others are wrong but that you are right. However, truthfully, whenever we criticize others, we become darkened within. When we consider others more excellent than ourselves by treasuring the portion of Christ in them, our inner being becomes bright.</p>
<p>Many times, when we point a finger at others, our inner being not only becomes darkened but also dry. We become unsatisfied and dry, like a garden that is not watered (cf. v. 11). You must check with yourself as to whether this is true: the more you criticize God&rsquo;s children&mdash;the church, the elders, the deacons, and the saints&mdash;the more your inner being becomes dry and dark. Not only so, you become a destroyer, not a builder. However, if you stop criticizing others, speaking wickedly, and spreading death, but instead you fear the Lord, treasure the Christ in the saints, and do not look at the earthen vessels, immediately you will be illuminated, refreshed, watered, and satisfied within.</p>
<p>Not only so, you will become a &ldquo;repairer of the breach&rdquo; (v. 12), and you will do a building work in the church. You can build up that which was torn down, and you can repair that which was desolate. Otherwise, darkness, dryness, desolation, and tearing down will be your portion. The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;If you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another&rdquo; (Gal. 5:15). May our heart not be hardened to the extent that we cannot receive the shining of the Lord&rsquo;s word. May we all receive grace from the Lord.</p>
<p>We must see that Christ is in the saints, and we must see that every portion of Christ is precious. We must not forget that we are earthen vessels. If we want to look at shortcomings, we should first look at our own shortcomings before we look at others&rsquo; shortcomings (Matt. 7:3-5). We also should see the Christ in others before we look at the Christ in ourselves. May we continue to learn this lesson.</p>
<p>When we break bread in the table meeting, we are enjoying Christ, and we are also enjoying the saints. For this reason, we must deal with the problems between us and the Lord. Whenever there is disharmony or a barrier between us and the Lord, we must deal with it. At the same time, we must also deal with any barrier or disharmony that exists between us and the saints. We must ask for forgiveness and for reconciliation. We must also forgive others so that we are in harmony with the saints.</p>
<p>If we practice this, we will have God&rsquo;s presence, we will have light, and we will be watered. As a result, we will be builders. Although we are earthen vessels full of weaknesses and deserving of criticism, we will be full of the presence of the Lord, and His presence will make up for our lack. The Lord&rsquo;s presence will make up for whatever shortcomings we have, and His presence will rescue us from our mistakes. We will be blessed. Then our bread-breaking will be genuine, and we will be blessed instead of suffering a loss. We must not be those who argue, criticize, or judge the saints yet at the same time break bread with them. Doing this will offend the Lord&rsquo;s Body and make us unworthy of eating the Lord&rsquo;s bread. Furthermore, we may lose His blessing.</p>
<p>We must each fear the Lord. It is not a small thing to fear the Lord. Every time we break bread, we remember the Lord. The bread indicates that the Lord gave His body for us on the cross, and it also indicates that He has regenerated us with His life, making us His mystical Body. Hence, whenever we take the bread, we should deal with any barrier between us and the Lord and any barrier between us and the saints. When we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we should be able to say that we have no problems with the Lord and that by His precious blood and in His grace we also have no problems with the saints. We do not criticize, blame, judge, or condemn any brother or sister. They are earthen vessels, just as we are earthen vessels. They are weak, and we are also weak; however, we do not look at weaknesses.</p>
<p>We treasure the saints because there is a portion of Christ in them (1 Cor. 12:24-25). We love and honor them because of the portion of Christ in them. By being in harmony with all the saints and blending with them, we enjoy them. Then when we take the bread, we can declare, &ldquo;I enjoy my Lord, and I also enjoy my brothers and sisters. My Lord is my food, and the Christ in the brothers and sisters is also my food. My Lord is for me to enjoy, and He is in all the saints for me to enjoy. Not only do I enjoy the Lord directly, but I also enjoy the Lord indirectly through all the saints. This is my enjoyment at the bread-breaking meeting.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ Making His Home in Our Heart and the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
