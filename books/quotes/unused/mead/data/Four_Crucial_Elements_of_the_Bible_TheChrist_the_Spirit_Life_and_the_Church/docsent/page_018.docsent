   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 7:37-39; 14:16-20; Acts 16:7b; Rom 8:9b; Phil 1:19; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:16; Rev 2:7; 3:22; 14:13; 22:17; John 6:63b</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You as the fountain of living water for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, we come to drink of You again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May You satisfy us more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Open Your word to us, Lord, and wash and renew us with the water in Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>May You, as the cleft rock, flow forth the living water again to us that we all may be refreshed, satisfied, and rejoicing in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We desire to praise You aloud and bear Your testimony forever.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE CENTER OF THE BIBLE BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for us to love a certain thing, that thing must be lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, we love something not because we are capable of loving; rather, it is because a certain thing is lovable and we are drawn to love it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are very reluctant to love something that is not lovable, but it is difficult for us to refrain from loving something that is lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, we love the Lord because we are attracted by His loveliness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is very attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the past two thousand years, innumerable people have been attracted and charmed by Him, and we are among them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes our relatives and friends rebuke us, saying, "Why do you believe in Jesus so blindly?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not know why and we cannot explain it, but we are simply charmed by the Lord Jesus because He is truly full of attractiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This Christ who is full of attractiveness and rich in magnetism is the essence of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible covers thousands of items and deals with a great number of doctrines, but it has only one center Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let us use the human body as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can see skin and hair on the surface, touch the flesh and bones within, and examine the internal organs through dissection or by an x-ray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the center, the essence, of man, which is man's life, is neither visible nor touchable, yet it is real and crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, the Bible has its "skeleton" and "skin."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we touch or see only these things in our reading of the Bible, we are not different from the unbelievers in their reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must realize that the Bible also has its life, its essence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The life, the essence, of the Bible is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible consists of two sections: the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Old Testament speaks of Christ with a great part in types and a considerable part in prophecies but nearly with no plain words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This may be compared to the teaching material in kindergartens that consists of very few plain words but many pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The teaching material in graduate schools, however, contains very few pictures; instead, it contains many classical writings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the Old Testament, like the teaching material in kindergartens, consists mostly of pictures with very few plain words, it is not simple to understand the meaning of the pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, concerning the types in the Old Testament, we need to understand their significance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are six major categories of types in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first category is human beings; the second, animals; the third, plants; the fourth, minerals; the fifth, offerings; and the sixth, foods.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All these six major categories contain types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Human Beings</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some examples from the category of human beings are Adam, typifying Christ as the head of the human race; Isaac, typifying Christ as the seed of Abraham; and Solomon, the son of David, typifying Christ as the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is not only the head of the human race but also the seed of man and the seed of woman.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the King, the Priest, and the Prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the King, He is typified by Judah and David; as the Priest, He is typified by Melchisedec and Aaron; and as the Prophet, He is typified by Isaiah and Jonah.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, to understand all the portrayals of Christ in the aspect of human beings, we have to study Adam, Abraham, David, Solomon, Melchisedec, Aaron, Isaiah, Jonah, and others.</S>
