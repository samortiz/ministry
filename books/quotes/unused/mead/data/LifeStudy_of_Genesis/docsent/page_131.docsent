   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. As the Evil Spirit Working in Fallen Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Satan, the serpent, is the evil spirit that works in fallen man Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This evil spirit does not lie dormant, but actively works in the children of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consider, as an example, how Satan worked in Judas, the man who betrayed the Lord Jesus John 13:2, 27; 6:70 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How Satan worked in that pitiful man!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have already seen that Peter was referred to as Satan Matt 16:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we did not have such a record as Matthew 16, no one would believe that Peter, a leading apostle, could have become Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, even after the day of Pentecost Ananias and Sapphira were filled with Satan and lied to the Holy Spirit Acts 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ananias and Sapphira were not in a gambling casino; they were in the church after the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, they were filled with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we know Satan's whereabouts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is not far from us; he is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some Christians think to themselves, "After we are saved and are in the Body of Christ, Satan has nothing to do with us."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This thought is not the voice of the Holy Spirit; it is the voice of the subtle serpent, and the preaching of this concept is the lie of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all must be on the alert because even now the subtle one is still present with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as we are in the old creation, the serpent remains within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE WOMAN A. Signifying All the People of God</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we need to see who the woman is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Undoubtedly, the woman in Genesis 3:15 firstly is Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Secondly, as all the fundamental teachers agree, this woman also refers to Mary, the mother of Jesus, because the seed of the woman was the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus was not born of a man, but of a woman, a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, His title is "the seed of the woman."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the woman has a threefold significance, not only signifying Eve and the virgin Mary, but also the woman revealed in Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The woman of Revelation 12:1 is a universal woman who includes all the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, she is a corporate woman.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, some people interpret the woman of Revelation 12 as Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Mary was an individual, local virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we read Revelation 12, we can see that the woman unveiled there is universal, not local.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She has twelve stars upon her head, the moon under her feet, and is clothed with the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All of this certainly indicates that she is universal and corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The best way to interpret the Bible is to consult other portions of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We see a similar vision in Joseph's dream Gen 37:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In that dream Joseph saw the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sun signified Jacob, Joseph's father; the moon signified Joseph's mother; and the eleven stars signified Joseph's brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, in principle, the sun, moon, and stars together represent the entire body of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, the woman in Revelation 12 is not an individual, local virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She is universal and corporate, including all the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the Bible, the people of God can be classified into three categories: the patriarchs, Israel, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The patriarchs, who came before the nation of Israel, are signified in Revelation 12 by the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Israel, which lived during the dark time, is signified by the moon under the woman's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Lord Jesus came, the sun shone Luke 1:78-79 , and the church came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In a sense, during the present age the church is in the sun, in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So, the church is represented by the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we can see that this woman is composed of the patriarchs, Israel, including Mary, the mother of Jesus, and all the church people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She includes all the people of God beginning with Adam and continuing throughout the Old Testament period and the New Testament age until the time that the Lord Jesus returns.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are all included in this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have stated many times that our position before God is that of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our status is not that of a man, but of a wife, for we are all a woman before God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not consider that you are a wise, strong, capable man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you assume this kind of position, you are immediately fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether we are brothers or sisters, we all have the same position before God that of a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must say, "Lord, I stand on the position of a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I know nothing and I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lord, I put my trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You are my husband."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever we take such a position, leaning upon the Lord Jesus, we all are a part of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All of the patriarchs were people like this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The genuine Israelites and all the people in the church throughout the generations have been people like this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We also must be people like this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to say, "O Lord, apart from You we are helpless and can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We put our trust in You."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must realize that according to the Bible the woman signifies the weaker vessel 1 Pet 3:7 .</S>
