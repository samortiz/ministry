Thank God that He has allowed me to rest in Him and once again take up the responsibility of the work. My illness during the last two or three years has surely been used by God to test the compassions of many saints. My weakness has become the opportunity for many to love the Lord. When I consider your love and kindness toward me, how grateful I am! When I hear of the many brothers and sisters scattered in different places who, though they have not met me, yet because of our relationship in the Lord, have wept bitterly before Him for my health, I feel that what you have bestowed upon me is so deep while that which I have given you is so shallow. Because of this I cannot help feeling that if I had more life, energy, and time, how much I would like to spend it on the saints.</P><P>Though my sickness has been accumulating over many years, it was worsened by writing The Spiritual Man. Thank God, now I am recovering. I am again able to write a few letters, prepare a few articles, lead several Bible study sessions, and attend a few meetings. There are still many other things I could wish to do but cannot do. Still I am thankful to God for what I can do. Those who know the human body say that I have been close to death several times, but thank God He has been keeping me up to this day. I hope that in the days of my sojourning on this earth I may be able to serve Him and you faithfully.</P><P>I would like to say a few words concerning the goal of the work of the co-workers in Shanghai. We deeply feel that there is a lack in the church in China today because many do not realize the meaning of genuine spiritual work and the way that one should take before God. Therefore, we hope that we can contact those who are seeking the Lord in all places and render them some help. Some may think that the content of The Present Testimony is too deep and too specialized. However, many readers have written to us saying that while other magazines are greatly used by the Lord, The Present Testimony provides what the others do not. For this reason we are convinced that the command which we have received of the Lord is right. By the grace of the Lord, The Present Testimony will therefore continue to speak forth the deep things of God this year and in the years to come, the Lord willing.</P><P>The gospel tracts that we have published have been truly blessed by the Lord. We have given away over five million tracts during the past two to three years. This year alone, we have printed over 1.5 million tracts. We have no lack of money for printing, although we have asked contributions from no one, and no one has given us an endowment fund. The Lord Himself has put the need of this work in the hearts of men, and little contributions given here and there enable us to accomplish what He wishes us to accomplish. We really thank Him!</P><P>The article published in this issue of The Present Testimony, "Self-knowledge and God's Light," is indispensable knowledge for God's children who are going on in this way. May God use it to release the ones in bondage. We hope that as you read it, you will pray much.</P><P>Friends, the time is truly short! Our Lord is at the door! May we seize this last opportunity to give ourselves to God's will and be led to the place that is after His heart. May we be faithful and not regret when we look back in eternity. He loves us and has given Himself for us. He should have our all. May there be nothing that will give rest to our hearts in this desolate wilderness. May our eyes be set all the time on the Lord who is not here. Peace be to you!</P><P>A household slave of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee, Shanghai<br>February 28, 1931</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND GOD'S LIGHT</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 19</H2><P>Today, I believe that God wants me to give a message on how to know ourselves. A Christian never progresses in spirituality if he does not know himself. And a Christian can never spiritually progress further than what he knows. Whatever light (not knowledge) he receives, he expresses life to that degree. No Christian can progress further than the light which God has given him. If a Christian does not know his faults or his real condition, he will not pursue after what is new or go on in the way ahead.</P><P>The most important thing in a Christian's life is to judge himself. He must consider his own flesh as not trustworthy and himself as absolutely useless. Only in this way will he utterly trust God. And only then can he walk according to the Holy Spirit and not according to the flesh. Without self-judgment, spiritual living is impossible. I have already spoken on this matter in another place; therefore, I shall not expand on it here. If one does not know himself, he will not judge himself and he will not have the spiritual blessings that come from self-judgment. God wants us to know how corrupt and how unable our flesh is to satisfy His demand. Because we do not know this, we fail to have the living which is purely in the Holy Spirit. Unconsciously we are filled with a heart of self-approval and self-confidence because of the shortage of self-knowledge. We consider ourselves trustworthy and fail to understand the meaning of the Lord's word, "Apart from Me you can do nothing" (John 15:5). Although the Holy Spirit is given to help our weaknesses, ignorance of our own weaknesses blind us from looking for His help, and so we remain weak. If we do not know ourselves, we will not only be self-confident and self-approving, but we will also be full of self-content, thinking marvelously of ourselves and being full of a pride that is most displeasing to God. Because we do not know ourselves, our daily living will have many shortcomings. We will have no feeling about unfulfilled duties, unrighteousnesses toward others, instances of lack of love, and instances of being angry, anxious, and unmerciful. Although the situation gets worse and worse, we feel at ease and content. Because we do not know ourselves, we do not know how great is our lack and how complete and precious is the salvation in Christ. As a result we miss so many spiritual blessings. Self-knowledge is the first condition toward betterment, because only those who know themselves desire for the better-yes, even God's best. Those who do not know themselves will not have a hungry and thirsty heart, and they will not have the filling of the Holy Spirit. Selfknowledge is absolutely indispensable to a Christian.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IS SELF-KNOWLEDGE DERIVED FROM<br>SELF-EXAMINATION?</H2><P>How do worldly people know their mistakes? They know by the method of introspection. They examine their own deeds and think back on their past. They "turn inward" to examine their motives and deeds. Introspection is commonly described as self-examination and evaluation. If worldly people do not examine themselves, they have no way of knowing themselves. I often hear many Christians say that they must examine themselves to see if they have committed any mistake. But let me tell you: self-examination is not the duty of a Christian. Self-examination is a big deception; many Christians are damaged by self-examination. We need to ask, (1) Does the Bible teach self-examination? (2) Can self-examination enable us to know ourselves? (3) Is self-examination profitable? From these we will prove that self-examination is really not the duty of a Christian.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Does the Bible Teach Self-examination?</H2><P>Does the Bible command Christians to examine themselves? No! Griffith Thomas said that in the whole Bible there are only two places which mention self-examination, but both refer to something specific. Let us look at these two instances.</P><P>"But let a man prove himself, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup" (1 Cor. 11:28). The proving in this verse is not an examination which Christians have in the pursuit of holiness; rather, it speaks of coming before the Lord to eat the bread and drink the cup. We should examine ourselves to see if we confess that the bread and the cup are the Lord's body and the Lord's blood. Eating the bread and drinking the cup is a testimony. Therefore, we must examine ourselves to see if we remember its spiritual significance; otherwise, it will become a ritual. Self-examination in this verse concerns whether or not we come to the Lord's table to remember the Lord. It does not ask us to turn inward to search for wrongs so that we can pursue after spiritual progress.</P><P>"Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves" (2 Cor. 13:5). This verse, even more than the first, does not tell us to examine our inward condition. This portion indicates something specific. At that time in Corinth, there were many who slandered Paul by saying that Paul was not an apostle. Therefore Paul asked them, "Examine yourselves, whether you have faith or not. If you have faith, then that is the proof of my being an apostle. If God had not called me to be the apostle to the Gentiles, then how could you be saved? God called me to preach the gospel to you, Corinthians. Your salvation proves that I am a true apostle. If you have no faith, then I am a false apostle." The self-examination mentioned here is not a self-examination during our pursuit of holiness. Rather, it is a particular case of a particular condition existing in Corinth-a self-examination of whether or not there was faith.</P><P>In the Old Testament in the Chinese Bible, there is at least one more place which mentions examining oneself. "Examine your ways" (Hag. 1:5, 7, KJV). First, please take notice that it does not say that you must consider yourselves; rather, it says that you must examine your ways. This is outward. Second, the word examine in the original language means "to consider." It says that you must consider your outward behavior. It does not say that you should examine your inward condition.</P><P>When we read the context of the three portions mentioned above, we should realize that they are not talking about introspection. Rather, they talk about the examination of a particular matter. Therefore, we have the confidence to conclude that the Bible does not teach Christians to examine themselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Can Self-examination<br>Enable Us to Know Ourselves?</H2><P>Even if we examine ourselves, our experience tells us that we still cannot know ourselves. Let us see what the Bible says about us.</P><P>Jeremiah 17:9 says: "The heart is deceitful above all things / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?" Since our heart is deceitful, our self-examination will not be reliable. Because we are using a deceitful heart to examine ourselves, we cannot avoid being deceived by this deceitful heart. Perhaps you are wrong, but your heart may tell you that you are not wrong. Or perhaps you are not wrong, but because of some weaknesses, your heart may tell you that you are wrong. If the heart were proper, then it could be used as a standard; but, since the heart is deceitful, how can it be used as a standard? If you use an inaccurate standard to examine yourself, surely it will be hard for you not to be deceived.</P><P>A man was installing a chimney, and after he measured it with his ruler, he told the metal worker to make it ten feet long. When it was finished and delivered to him, no matter how he measured, it was one foot too long. He complained to the metal worker, and the metal worker measured it with his own ruler. It was exactly ten feet. However, the installer insisted that it was one foot too long. Eventually, the metal worker looked at the man's ruler and found that one-tenth of the man's ruler had been sawed off by his son who had played with it. Therefore, the chimney always measured one foot too long. If we would examine ourselves, we must first ask whether or not we are trustworthy. We have been corrupted and in the sight of God are very evil. How can we examine ourselves? Many think that self-examination is a virtue. But let me tell you: self-examination is a big mistake.</P><P>We have to know that the structure of our inward psychological parts is complex. Our desire, thought, feeling, and other manifestations of our heart are very complex. We cannot clearly analyze how they influence and interact one with the other. In such a complicated condition, even though we can examine ourselves, self-examination will never give us accurate self-knowledge. While you are examining your feelings, you do not know how your feelings are affected by and connected with all the other areas. Therefore, knowledge gained from your feeling is not trustworthy. Only a little influence can change your feeling completely. Many times concerning a certain matter we lose the proper view and do not have the accurate knowledge regarding our own intentions because there is a little hidden sin, wrong thought, or little prejudice inside us or because of our disposition by birth and innumerable other little causes. Any knowledge which we derive from ourselves is inaccurate because it is so complicated and untrustworthy.</P><P>We often come across a situation in which a person is very good on some point but does not know it; rather, he feels that he is weak on that point. On the other hand, he is weak on another point, yet he does not realize it but considers himself to be very good on that point. We often see this. This shows us that, even though man may examine himself, it is still impossible for him to know himself. Man cannot know himself through self-examination. I have a friend who talked very much about Christian love after he was saved. According to his view he considered himself to have much love, but in his home he was not at peace with his wife. Think about it! If one wishes to examine himself, is his self reliable? If his self is not trustworthy, then examining himself is useless.</P><P>Psalm 19:12 asks, "Who can discern his errors?" No one can know. We cannot know for sure our errors by ourselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Is Self-examination Profitable?</H2><P>Not only is there no teaching in the Bible concerning self-examination and not only do our experiences tell us that we are incapable of examining ourselves, but also there is even great harm to our spiritual living if we examine ourselves. Self-examination will produce two kinds of results: either self-contentment or discouragement. When someone feels that he is quite good after self-examination, he becomes self-contented; when one feels that he is wrong after self-examination, he is discouraged. There is not a third result in addition to self-contentment and discouragement. God has taught me to know that no one can truly know himself through self-examination.</P><P>Hebrews 12:2 says: "Looking away unto Jesus...." In the original language between looking and Jesus there are some small words. We must translate it as "Looking away-unto Jesus." This means in order for you to look unto, you must first look away. You must first look away from what you should not be looking at; then you can look unto what you should. In Chinese we have an idiom "looking away completely," [Editor's Note: Wang Duan]. Therefore, I think this clause may be translated as "looking away completely-unto Jesus." Our spiritual living is based upon looking unto Jesus and not on turning back to ourselves. If we do not obey the command of the Bible to look unto Jesus but instead turn to look inside ourselves, we will suffer much spiritually. I have already said before that introspection-ourselves analyzing ourselves and our own feeling, intention, and thought-is most harmful. Griffith Thomas said, "There is now a common saying that if you look at yourself once, you must then look at Christ ten times. But I think this must be changed to look at Christ eleven times and do not look at yourself even once."</P><P>Two years ago I read a poem which was a fable. There was a centipede talking with a toad. The toad asked the centipede, "You have so many legs, how do you walk? Which leg do you move forward first when you walk?" The centipede then tried to determine which leg moved forward first when it walked. No matter how hard it tried, it could not set its feet right. Afterward it became tired and said, "I don't care, I'm leaving." When it started to go, it again thought of which leg to move first and this inhibited it from taking any step. After a while sunshine came through the clouds. When the centipede saw the rays, it became very happy and ran toward the sun, forgetting all about the stepping order of so many legs. Thus it was able to move once more. This fable is just a picture of our Christian living. The more we turn and look back, the more we cannot move and the more we retrogress. When we look at the light of the Lord, unconsciously we move forward.</P><P>Several years ago I read an article in an English magazine called The Overcomers which talked about very deep spiritual matters. The title of the article was "What is Self." The writer said, "Self is nothing other than one reflecting on oneself and one considering oneself." This sentence is truly deep and real. The time that our selves are active is when we turn and think of ourselves. We must remember that the soul is the feeling of the self. After the Welsh revival, there was a college professor who went to see the revivalist Mr. Roberts. The professor spent one day with him and talked with him about many questions. After he left, he wrote an article in the newspaper about his impression of Mr. Roberts. He said that Mr. Roberts was a man without any self-consciousness. Our defeat comes from too much consideration of ourselves; all we remember is our victory or our defeat. As a result, Christ cannot be completely manifested in us.</P><P>The way of our victory is not through a constant, unceasing analysis of ourselves. Rather, it is to look away unto Jesus. It is not the removal of evil thoughts, but the retention of good thoughts; it is not the eradication of something in ourselves, but yielding to the infilling of Christ in us to the extent that we completely forget about ourselves. Whenever we think back on ourselves, our steps are immediately halted. The Bible does not tell us to consider how we run. Rather, it tells us to run by looking away unto Jesus. If we turn to examine ourselves, we will see that we are in a fog; the more we examine, the more we become unclear. If we look away unto Jesus, we will naturally be able to run well.</P><P>When I was learning to ride a bicycle, many times I would ride it too close to the side of the wall and hit the wall. Every day I hurt my hand. Later I asked a schoolmate who could ride a bicycle to tell me my problem. When I rode on the bicycle, I fixed my eyes on the handlebars on the front of the bicycle, hoping that my hands might be steadier and the bicycle might not weave. But it did not work. The more I looked at the handlebars and tried to steady my hands, the more my hands trembled and the more the bicycle weaved. My schoolmate told me that I veered and hit the wall because I was looking at the handlebars and not the road. In order not to weave and hit the wall, the eyes must keep looking at the road ahead. Our living is the same way. Whenever we turn to look at ourselves, we will fail. We must look forward.</P><P>Many Christian failures are due to introspection and self-examination. When Christians turn to examine themselves, even if there is no other harm, they have lost at least one step. The Bible does not command Christians to examine themselves, because self-examination is not only unprofitable, but it hinders progress as well. Many Christians, after a day is over, review the things of the day and examine themselves. They are just fooling themselves. The apostle Paul did not care how others judged him. He did not even judge himself. He said, "Do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God" (1 Cor. 4:5). Paul knew that only when the Lord shines His light can anyone know what is right and what is wrong. If a Christian repeatedly considers himself, he surely will fail. He will be proud and consider himself better than his companions when he thinks that he has no fault. He will be discouraged and see no way out when he thinks about his faults. If our self-knowledge comes from the shining of God, then the results will be different.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROPER WAY</H2><P>Do we mean to say that we can be careless about our daily life and need not ask whether our walk is right or wrong, or whether our intention is pure or impure? Our understanding is that the Bible does not teach us of self-examination, but we have not read that the Bible forbids us from knowing our self. Turning inward and thinking about oneself is harmful, but indulging oneself in looseness is even more harmful. God never allows us to be loose. Although God does not want us to examine ourselves, He wants us to know ourselves because the coming of the Holy Spirit causes man to reprove himself of his sin. According to the Bible, we should not pursue holiness through self-examination. This, however, does not mean that the Bible does not want us to pursue holiness. The Bible does not want us to know ourselves through self-examination, but this does not mean that the Bible does not want us to know ourselves. It is man's error to assume that self-examination and self-knowledge are inseparable. For this reason he thinks that refraining from examining oneself means that there is no need of knowing oneself. He does not realize that self-knowledge is still necessary, except that this self-knowledge must not come from self-examination. The goal remains the same. Only the way must be changed.</P><P>Since the Bible does not tell us to examine ourselves, what then is the way for us to know ourselves?</P><P>Let us read Psalm 26:2, "Examine me, O Jehovah, and try me; / Test my inward parts and my heart." And Psalm 139:23-24b, "Search me, O God, and know my heart: / Try me, and know my thoughts: / And see if there be any wicked way in me." These two portions of the Scripture tell us the proper way to know ourselves. We do not need to strive in self-examination or ask ourselves how we feel about ourselves in order to know our inward parts and heart. Nor should we strive to know our heart and thoughts to see if there is any wicked way in us. Rather, the way is to ask God to search us and to try us. Only when God searches us and tries us can we have accurate knowledge concerning ourselves. Our self-knowledge does not depend on our self-examination. Rather, it depends on God's inspection.</P><P>These portions of the Scripture tell us that if we want the knowledge concerning ourselves, we must ask God to tell us His knowledge about us. This is the most accurate knowledge. God knows us more clearly and more accurately than we know ourselves. Everything is naked and open before Him. He sees and knows even the most hidden part of our heart, which we are not able to feel or analyze by ourselves. When we have His sight, then we will not be fooled and we will know our real condition.</P><P>Actually, only God's knowledge concerning us is correct. Do you know how God thinks about you? When you think that you are so good, does God also think the same thing? When you think that you are very bad, does God also think the same thing? When you feel that you are good, do not consider that you are good; when you feel that you are no good, do not consider that you are no good. This is not accurate. When God regards you as good, then you are good. And when God regards you as evil, then you are evil.</P><P>While God does not want us to examine ourselves, this does not mean that He does not want us to know ourselves or live carelessly. If we examine ourselves, we will still not be able to know ourselves. Maybe what He considers to be wrong, we think is good; what He considers as defilement, we think of merely as a little mistake. He wants us to have His same view. Therefore, He wants us to reject our untrustworthy feelings in deciding our condition and receive His thought and understand His judgment so that we may have an accurate assessment of ourselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S LIGHT AND SELF-KNOWLEDGE</H2><P>How then can we know God's view concerning us? How can we enter into God's thought about us? Psalm 36:9 says, "In Your light we see light." In this verse there are two mentions of "light" and these two have different meanings. The first light is particular, it is "Your light"-the light of God. The second light is general; therefore, it says only "light" without using an adjective. The light of God is the knowledge of God; the sight of God is the view of God. To be in the light of God is to be exposed by God, to be told by God concerning what He knows. The second light means the real situation of a matter. Therefore, "in Your light we see light" means that when we receive the revelation of God, the shining of God's holy light, we are able to know the real situation of a certain matter. The matter will be clear as light in the eyes of our heart. In our own light we can never see light. Only in His light can we see light.</P><P>Ephesians 5:13 tells us clearly about the function of light: "But all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light; for everything that makes manifest is light." This tells us that the function of light is to manifest. The first light mentioned in Psalm 36:9 is objective, belonging to God. In this light we are exposed so that we see our real situation. This is the light which is seen in the light. We did not know our condition, but when the light of God shines, we see our condition. Many things which we have considered to be very good, when exposed one day under the light of God, we will realize are terrible. Perhaps we thought that we were better than everyone else, but when the light of God shines upon us, we see not only that sin is sin, but also many things which we considered to be good will be manifested to be sins. We should not make a self-examination and then report the results to the Lord; rather, we should be shined upon by the light and then confess before the Lord. Therefore, self-examination is not a virtue; it is a great mistake. It is not through self-examination, but rather through the light of God that we come to know ourselves. Only when we are in the light of God will we have the knowledge to know ourselves. As all the light of God concerning us becomes so bright, we will see what He sees in this light.</P><P>You do not have to ask when the light of God comes. Neither do you have to ask how I know that this is the light of God. There is no need for you to use a candle or a lantern to know the sun in the sky. As long as you can see yourself, you know that you are in the sunlight and that the sun has risen. Therefore, whenever the knowledge of yourself is so thorough and you see the true picture of yourself, utterly understanding the decadence of your own flesh, you will know that God has given you His light. Then you are in the light of God. If, however, your view about yourself is not as sober as the Bible's, if you do not feel that your flesh is as corrupted as the Bible says, and if you do not believe that you are as weak and despicable as the Bible says, then this proves that you have not received the light of God. You are not yet in the light of God. You do not have to ask where or what the light is. As long as you see the effect of light, you know what light is and where light is.</P><P>After Adam partook of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the first thing he saw was his shame-nakedness. This was the feeling of his own conscience. He felt his own shame. But did he fear God? No, he still had his own method. He made an apron out of the leaves of a fig tree to cover his shame. When the voice of God came, asking him, "Where are you?", he hid among the trees in the garden to escape from the face of God. But he had no way. He could not depend on the apron he had made. He had to admit that he was naked. The result of self-examination is at best like Adam seeing his own shame. Not only did he not feel sorry for his sin; he tried to cover it. When God asked him the question, Adam really knew himself. God asked Adam, "Where are you?" Did God not know where Adam was? Certainly He knew. God asked so that Adam himself might know where he was. Those among us who have experience can testify that when we examine ourselves, even though we may see something wrong, we only cover it up by our own method. But whenever we are shined upon by God's light, there is no way to hide.</P><P>A certain believer asked a Jew whether or not he wanted to be saved, and he said no. The believer then compelled him to kneel down and pray that God would let him know himself. He realized how very filthy he was when the light of God shined. He saw his sins and wished that the floor would open up to swallow him. This shows us that a sinner needs the light of God to know that he is a sinner.</P><P>It is very hard for many sinners to confess that they are sinners before they are saved. Although many sinners are truly sinners in the view of others, they themselves do not feel like sinners. They will know how sinful and how wicked they are only when the light of God comes. The self-reproof produced by the light of God will cause them to feel that there is no hiding place. Many sinners know that they have sins. They feel this in their hearts and confess this with their mouths. To others, these people seem to have the wisdom of self-knowledge. But when the Holy Spirit sheds forth God's light, they realize that the sins which they have confessed are only superficial and that they do not hate sins the same way as God. After this enlightenment they will utterly feel that their sins are deplorable and that they need to seek deliverance. Let me add a word here: those of us who labor in the work of God must not convince others of their sins by our arguments; rather, we can only ask the Holy Spirit to do the work of reproving people of their sins. All kinds of self-examinations are equally shallow, inadequate, and erroneous. Only the light of God can cause man to see the picture of his true self as God sees him.</P><P>As Christians, day by day we know ourselves not through self-examination but through the light of God. When the light of God shines upon us, we will realize that we are corrupt to the uttermost. Perhaps we express much love to others. But when the light of God shines, we see that we have not loved others enough. We see that we are still short in many ways toward others. We gain many people and consider our work to be successful. But when the light of God shines, we realize that our works are nothing but the works of the flesh. They are vain and unprofitable. We begin to know that our works have not been done by God. Many times we think that we are doing the will of God wholeheartedly and that we are not seeking after anything for ourselves; but, when the light of God shines, we realize that we are not obeying the will of God. I once asked Miss Barber concerning her experience in obeying the will of God. She said, "Every time that God delays telling me His will, then I reckon that within me there is still a heart unwilling to obey the will of God. Within me there must still be an improper aim. I realized this from many experiences." When we seek the will of God and do not find an answer, we should ask God to search us to see if there is any unwillingness within us. When the light of God shines, we will see the inward situation. We think that we do not have any unwillingness within to obey God. But we are cheated by our own selves. When we wash our face, do we examine ourselves to see if there is white powder, black spots, or dirty mud on our faces, or do we look into the mirror to find out? If we want to know ourselves, we should not think about how we are, but ask for the shining of God's light. Only then will we know our condition. Many times we think that our intention is not wrong, but when God's light shines upon us, we realize how much selfishness, self provision, and even unrighteousness is within us. Without God's shining, we think our living is still acceptable. But when it is shined upon by God, we realize that we have failed. In the light of God, we can then see light.</P><P>The difference between a deep Christian and a shallow Christian hinges upon how much of the light of God they have received and whether it is permanent or temporary. Under the light of God, one sees black as black and white as white. The shallow Christian sees his shortages on a certain point only when he is exposed by God at a particular time. The deep Christian is constantly under God's shining, and he knows himself. Some of us here may have the following experience: we see a young Christian talking about his love for the Lord and how he has consecrated everything to the Lord. But we feel that he does not know what he is talking about. He still does not know how difficult it is to be consecrated to God and what the result of that consecration will be in the future. He only speaks according to his feeling at that moment.</P><P>This is like the Lord Jesus' response to James and John when they asked the Lord Jesus: "Grant to us to sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory. But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized? And they said to Him, We are able" (Mark 10:37-39). They did not know how deep and far-reaching were the things included in these two sentences. They hastily replied, "We are able." When we do not have the light of God, we are like these two disciples. We do not know how weak we are, and we do not know the extent of God's requirement upon us. We think we are able in everything. When the light of God shines, then we know that in many matters of spiritual truth, all we are saying are just words. We do not understand the meaning of them at all.</P><P>Not only will our goodness be manifested under God's light to not be good, but even what we normally consider as not good will be brought under God's light to a point where we further realize the extent of its not being good. Oftentimes we know very well that we are weak in certain points. We feel so. We tell others of the same, and we tell God this in our prayers. However, concerning our weakness, we do not have a deep enough feeling; we do not feel that it is so despicable. Moreover, although we know of this weakness, we still carelessly pass the days away. When the light of God comes, we will realize our weakness to the uttermost. Only then will we desperately feel the pain of this weakness and only then will we have a heart that deplores this weakness. Furthermore, we will feel that if we are not delivered from this, we cannot live on any longer. The difference in depth between the self-knowledge derived from our examination and the self-knowledge received from the light of God is too great to be measured. Therefore, friends, even if you know yourself, without the light of God you do not truly know yourself yet. Self-knowledge derived from examination merely demonstrates what you say about yourself. Self-knowledge received from the light of God demonstrates how God sees you. The judgment we have concerning ourselves can never be as accurate as the judgment of God concerning us.</P><P>Here we see the difference between the light of God and knowledge. Knowledge is what we know; it is understood in our mentality. The light of God is what God knows, and it is revealed to us through His Spirit. Many make a mistake in thinking that the light spoken of in the Bible means knowledge. For this reason we often hear people say that someone has much light, but his life is very poor. This cannot be so. Light is not knowledge. The Bible says that knowledge puffs up. But when the light of God shines into a man's heart, it does not puff him up. Rather, it causes him to reprove himself, repent of the past, hate the flesh, and beg in ashes for God to deliver him from his filthiness. It is possible for one to be full of biblical knowledge, yet at the same time, void of any of the light of God in his heart. If one has backslidden, he can still tell people about the Bible from his previous understanding, but he does not have the light of God. God's light is knowledge which is found in the power of the Holy Spirit, and knowledge is that light of God that is retained by man in his mentality. Knowledge has its place both in the Bible and in spiritual experiences, but knowledge apart from the power of the Holy Spirit is dead. Scofield said, "There is nothing more dangerous than when truth is divorced from power." Even though we may know much truth and receive much knowledge, we have no light and are not able to know our true condition or walk on the path ahead if these are not in the power of the Holy Spirit. If we have received light from God, we must then guard what we have received through the Holy Spirit who gave us the light, and we must make it the lasting light to our path, not letting it lose its power.</P><P>Oftentimes God gives us light and grants us true perception to a certain matter. During that time we seem to discern the deepest and the innermost part of the matter. It seems that everything is laid out before us and manifest in a naked way before our eyes. After a while, even though we still remember the experience and retain the knowledge, our feeling toward the matter seems to be not as deep, as if what we now see is not as clear as before. At this moment, the light of God is gone. What remains is nothing but knowledge. (Note: At the very least we must walk according to the knowledge we have. This does not mean, however, that it is enough just to have knowledge. We also need light.) Light can cause man to have the deepest feeling; knowledge cannot.</P><P>Therefore, if we want to walk in the path, the shining of God is indispensable. Our own feelings will either completely fool us or reduce the conviction of our sin. We will be following a blind guide if we are to pursue holiness through our feelings. There needs to be the light of God. Only then will the real condition of a matter be manifested. Light means how God sees our condition and what God says. When God says it is wrong, it is wrong. When God says it is one hundred per cent wrong, it is one hundred per cent wrong. Before the light comes, it is merely what you think and is not reliable. It is not what you say your life is, but what God says your life is.</P><P>When Miss Barber died, she left a Bible to me. Written in it were the words, "O God, grant me a thorough and unlimited revelation of myself." How deep is this! We often think that as long as we do not see anything wrong that this is good enough. Little do we realize that God has another kind of view regarding us. We will just be fooling ourselves if we do not receive the sight of God. We must have the boldness to be shined upon by God with His light so that He can reveal to us the real picture of ourselves. We have no way to know our own selves unless there is the shining of God. Our own evaluation of ourselves is not trustworthy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHERE DOES THIS LIGHT COME FROM?</H2><P>First, Christ is our light. John 8:12 says, "Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." The Lord Jesus is light. When we draw near to the Lord, we shall see light. Often we think that this is quite good and that is not bad. But when we tell the Lord the facts of a situation, asking Him for enlightenment, we find to our surprise that everything is wrong. Day after day we think there is nothing wrong. But when we draw near to the Lord, everything is manifested to be wrong. One is our own standard, while the other is God's standard. When we draw near to the Lord, we will realize that our standard is not enough. If a Christian does not pray much for a revelation of his real condition, you can guarantee in nine cases out of ten that this Christian is in error. The more we draw near to the Lord, the more we will receive the light of God.</P><P>Second, the Word of God is our light. Psalm 119:105 says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path." Verse 130 says, "The entrance of thy words giveth light." These two verses may be very familiar to us, but if we read them carefully before God we will know how deep these verses are. Is the path in which you are walking justified by man or is it justified by God? The work of the flesh cannot escape the shining of the light of God. It is not what man says; rather, it is what the Word of God says. Day by day we should not follow our feelings in judging whether a matter is right or wrong. Rather, we must let the Word of God decide whether it is right or wrong. We ourselves should not judge. Rather, we should let the Word of God make the judgment. Put yourself in the Word of God, and let the Word of God judge, let the Word of God point out your real condition. For this reason, we must read the Bible more, and we must trust that the Holy Spirit would manifest the Word of God to us so that we may know ourselves.</P><P>Third, Christians are our light. Matthew 5:14 says, "You are the light of the world." We are very familiar with this verse. Normally we think that this verse speaks only of a Christian's good behavior. But actually there is a very deep meaning here. It says that a Christian is light. A Christian can illuminate the true condition of a man. Many Christians who are in the light of God, make other Christians afraid of seeing them because once they are seen, they will be condemned of their own sins. A weak Christian is not afraid of seeing another Christian who is in the same condition. But when you come close to a Christian who is in the light of God, you feel shameful. You were proud, but after being shined upon by him, you feel shameful. You were dishonest, but after being shined upon by him, you feel shameful. Brothers and sisters, we are the workers of God, serving God. If you do not have the light of God, you will not be able to work. People cannot be drawn closer to God by you if you do not have the light to illuminate them. If you draw near to God and are controlled constantly by the light of God, spontaneously you will illuminate the real condition of the people who are contacting you. If we want to obey the will of God and do the work of God, we need to be a light.</P><P>When you come close to Christians who are near to God, they make you feel God. They do not make you sense their tenderness and humility; rather, they make you feel God. When I began to work, I decided, at whatever cost, to obey the will of God. I thought I was obeying the will of God. However, whenever I went to see Miss Barber, after talking and reading a few verses from the Bible with her, I was aware that I was still lacking. Every time I saw her, I always felt something special-God was there. When you came close to her, you felt God. She had light. She was controlled by the light of God; therefore, when you came close to her, her light condemned your sin.</P><P>We must remember one thing. Whether by drawing near to Christ, by reading God's Word, or by being with other Christians, all the light we receive comes from the revelation of the Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit who manifests the unapproachable light in which God dwells. It is He who manifests His glory, holiness, and righteousness. By this we see the absolute standard of God, so that we see ourselves, know our own real condition, and realize how we fall short of the standard of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE POWER OF THIS LIGHT</H2><P>The power of this light is the self-knowledge it renders to man. When a man gets into this light, it reveals to him his real condition. Many believers are very self-vindicating, self-satisfied, and full of self-pride. In this condition no human words, explanation, exhortation, warning, or reproof can make them see their own fallen state. Only when God gives grace and shines His light upon them through the Holy Spirit will this kind of person realize how corrupt, fallen, and hypocritical they are. When the light of God comes, everything changes color. In the light of God, everything shows its true color.</P><P>Actually, no man can be saved without being shined upon by God. No man can progress in the spiritual path and no man can have an effective work without being shined upon by God.</P><P>How can a sinner know that the Lord Jesus is the Savior? Surely not by argument. How can he know that he is a sinner? Surely not by reproof. No matter what method you use, whether arguing with the most logical words, debating with the most sufficient reason, or warning with the most stern words; none of these can make a sinner realize his own sins and see that Jesus is his Savior. I am not saying that all these methods are useless. They have their place. But they can only let people know mentally that they are sinners and that Jesus is the Savior. These methods can never cause them to see. Every sinner is blind, and this kind of blindness keeps him from seeing the true light of the gospel of God. The Holy Spirit opens the sinner's eyes through the light of God, enabling him to see the light of God. Seeing is a special blessing in the New Testament. God reveals His Son in me. This is an experience common to every saved sinner. It is most futile to get people to "receive Christianity," "believe in Jesus," and "become a Christian" by some beautiful thought, reason, warm feeling, emotion, music, tears, or argument. The light of God, the light that God emanates through the Holy Spirit, is the first indispensable element. The basic need is that a sinner must see his own condition and see the glory of Jesus. Getting him to shed tears, repent, be fervent, confess, and have good feelings are all futile. Only seeing in the Holy Spirit can cause a sinner to truly believe and receive the Lord Jesus as Savior. This is because you can never believe in what you have not seen, and you can never receive what you do not see. Because you have seen from within, you believe. Only this kind of faith is unmovable. Only this will withstand trials.</P><P>The progress of the Christian life does not depend upon many exhortations, warnings, and teachings. It is not a matter of telling a believer to be fervent, to do his duty, to read more of the Bible, or to pray more. All these are secondary; they are not primary. The primary element is to see. Therefore, when Paul wrote the letter to the Ephesians, though he knew that they were very good in the Lord and were not like the Corinthians who were so fallen morally, the first thing which he prayed for them was that God might enlighten the eyes of their hearts through the Holy Spirit. The progress of the Christian life is due to receiving the light of God, which opens a Christian's eyes and causes him to know the riches of the glory of God, and the greatness of the power of God that is given to him through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. If a Christian cannot see these things and does not know how rich these things are which he has received from God, then progress is an impossibility.</P><P>Anyone who is doing special work for God must be a person who has been shined upon by God. Only he who has been shined upon by God can judge his flesh. Only he who has judged his own flesh can be used by God. When the light of God comes, a believer is able to see how filthy he is because he has seen the holiness of God. He is able to know how unrighteous he is because he has seen the righteousness of God. He is able to know how corrupt he is because he has seen the glory of God. After a believer has known himself this way, he will be like one who is truly circumcised, not trusting in himself at all (not only not trusting, but deeply hating), but rather depending completely on the Spirit of God. Only this type of worker who is in the hands of God can be used by God. And only this type of worker can have the sight of God, seeing the plan of God and understanding the goal of God.</P><P>Because many people do not have the light of God, they consider themselves to be marvelous. Satan often cheats people by making them think that they have already obtained holiness and are sinless. Little do they realize that the reason they say this is because they do not have the light of God; hence, they do not know the corruption of the flesh. I am one who deeply believes in Christ being our life and that He can enable us to completely overcome sins. No Christian can excuse himself by saying that it is impossible for man to refrain from sin on this earth. But even if we are victorious, we cannot say that our flesh is not corrupted. There is a common error today: man either goes to one extreme or to the other. Some think that since they are corrupt, it is impossible for them not to sin. Others think that since they have received Christ to be their victory, sin is eradicated from within them, and therefore, they are no longer corrupt. Actually both of these are wrong. Truthfully, we are victorious in Christ, but we are corrupt in ourselves. A believer can have a life of complete victory over sin through Christ daily, and he can, at the same time, have the feeling that every day he is corrupt to the uttermost. The feeling of decadence and corruption cannot deter his victory because it is Christ overcoming in him and not himself. Likewise, his complete victory cannot remove from him the feeling of total corruption because the corruption of his flesh will not be changed in its nature by the deliverance of Christ.</P><P>Because so many have been deceived, thinking in their own small and dim light that they are so holy, sinless, and perfect in love, we need to see how many of the best and deepest saints in the Bible viewed themselves in the light of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Job</H2><P>Job was a righteous man. This was God's remark about him. During the time of his suffering, his three friends thought that he had sinned and had offended God. But he himself denied this and used great efforts to argue with them to prove that he was clean and righteous. We all know that when God revealed Himself to him, the Bible recorded it and said: "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; / but now mine eye seeth thee: / wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes" (Job 42:5-6). When the light of God came, he realized how despicable he was. The words of man could not make him reprove himself, but the light of God caused him to be humble.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Isaiah</H2><P>Before God sent Isaiah, He first manifested His own glory to him. In this glory the prophet of God could not but cry: "Woe is me, for I am finished! / For I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell: / Yet I have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts, with my eyes" (Isa. 6:5). Before he saw this vision, Isaiah's lips were unclean, and he was already dwelling in the midst of a people of unclean lips. But he did not feel it, and he probably thought that he could be a prophet serving God. When the bright light of God came, he was able to see the real condition of the people surrounding him. He was also able to see his own real condition, how unclean his mouth was and how unworthy he was to be a mouthpiece for God. So he cried, "Woe is me, for I am finished!" Truly, the holiness of God will bring out our "woe." After he knew himself in this way, the seraphim cleansed his mouth with live coal. Here we see a very good sequence: first uncleanness, then the light of God, then the self-knowledge of uncleanness, then the possibility of being cleansed, and finally the readiness to be sent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Daniel</H2><P>In the Bible there are two persons for whom there is no record of their sins. Daniel is one of them. From this, we know that before God he was pleasing to God. Yet the Bible tells us that when he saw the Lord and was shined upon by God, he said, "No strength was left in me, but my color turned deathly pale; and I retained no strength. Yet I heard the sound of His words; and when I heard the sound of His words, I fell into a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground" (Dan. 10:8-9). In the light of God, even the best saint cannot stand up. He had to bow to the ground.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Habakkuk</H2><P>When Habakkuk was shined upon by God, he also had the same experience. He said, "I heard and my body trembled; / My lips quivered at the sound. / Rottenness entered my bones, / And I tremble in my place" (Hab. 3:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Peter</H2><P>We know that Peter was a self-approving and self-trusting man. But when God shined a little bit of light through the Lord Jesus, giving Peter a glimpse of himself, he could not help but confess his own uncleanness. We know the story of how the disciples labored the whole night without catching anything. Then the Lord commanded them to cast the net in the deep water. They obeyed and caught many fishes, even filling up two boats. In this way the Lord manifested a ray of His glory and caused Peter to fall down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord" (Luke 5:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Paul</H2><P>Paul was the one who fought the good fight, finished his course, and kept the faith. When he was close to departing from this world, he told us, "I am the foremost" of sinners. What we want to note here is that the word "am" in the original language is in the present tense. This tells us how he considered himself at the time close to his death. He considered that the Lord Jesus came into the world to save sinners and that among the sinners he was the chief. He had nothing to boast about. He had no achievements, he had nothing special. He was like the other sinners, saved by the grace of Christ. Not only so, he considered himself to be worse than the others; therefore, he needed the grace of the Lord even more than they. Who has received more of the light of God than Paul? Because the light he received was more than that of the others, his self-knowledge was clearer than that of the others, and his self-judgment was more severe than that of the others. Only those without self-knowledge will consider themselves to be so holy, advanced, and special. The reason that they do not know themselves is because they have not received the light of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>John</H2><P>This disciple whom the Lord loved was closer to the Lord than the others during the time when the Lord hid His glory in His flesh. Recall that he was the disciple who leaned on the Lord's breast. After the Lord's resurrection, he did good works for the Lord for several decades, and the Lord especially used him to write an epistle which specifically talks about fellowship and particularly about the love of God and the light of God. Humanly speaking then, if this disciple saw the light of God, he should not have been so fearful as many others. Yet recall that on the island of Patmos he described the Lord Jesus revealing His glory with the words, "His face shone as the sun shines in its power" (Rev. 1:16); and when he saw Him, he "fell at His feet as dead" (v. 17). There is no one who has seen the light of God who will not fall to the ground.</P><P>Not only do we see in the Scriptures how biblical men humbled themselves, confessed their sins, and obtained self-knowledge through seeing the light of God; even from church history, we see that many of the truly holy saints discovered their own weaknesses and corruption because of their closeness to God's light. Of the persons that we are about to cite, who can deny that they are the most outstanding people in the church? Yet how humble is the view they had of themselves. This is due to no other reason than that the closer we come to God, the more we discover our weaknesses. The more we receive the light of God, the more we realize our corruption. Those who are proud and self-approving are that way because they have not seen the light of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Martin Luther</H2><P>When he was locked up in prison, he wrote a letter to one who was very powerful in the Roman church, saying, "Probably you may think that I am powerless now. The emperor can easily prohibit the petition of a pitiable monk such as I. However, you have to know that I will surely fulfill the responsibility which the love of Christ has placed upon me. I am not the least afraid of the power of Hades, let alone the Pope and his bishops." But when he saw himself in the light of God, this bravest of all reformers could not help but cry: "I am more afraid of my own heart than of the Pope and all his bishops. Within me there lies the biggest Pope-the self!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>John Knox</H2><P>This Scot, for the sake of Christ, was a teacher, evangelist, prisoner, slave, wanderer, reformer, and statesman; at the same time, he was a saint of the rarest kind. In his very last prayer, he said: "This prayer is what I, John Knox, with my dying tongue and my whole mind, request of my God." In this prayer, there are the following sentences:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>O Lord, have mercy on me, do not judge my innumerable sins; amongst them, may you forgive especially those sins which the world cannot reprove. In my youth, my middle age, and until now, how much conflict have I passed through. I have discovered that within me there is nothing besides falsehood and corruption. O Lord, only You are the Lord who knows the secrets of man's heart. Please remember that of all the sins which I mentioned, not one of them is pleasing to me. I often grieve over them: they are deeply hated by my inner man. Now I weep sorrowfully for my corruption. I can only rest simply in Your mercy.</P><P>This is the prayer of a man who has been shined upon by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>John Bunyan</H2><P>John Bunyan was put in prison for thirteen years because he wanted to preach the gospel. In prison he wrote the well- known book, Pilgrim's Progress. Except for the Bible, Pilgrim's Progress may have the most translations in the world. Spurgeon said of him, "In my view, the style of John Bunyan most resembles the style of the Lord Jesus; no man can come close to him." But when Bunyan wrote about himself, he said,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>After my previous repentance, there is again one thing which makes me sad; that is, if I most severely examine the best thing I am now doing, in it I discover sins, new sins mingled in the best thing I do. Therefore now, I cannot help but conclude that no matter how proud of myself and how idealistic I was concerning myself and my work, and even if my former living were without blemish, yet the sins that I commit in a day are enough to send me to hell.</P><P>In such a deep feeling of sins, he cried out: "Unless He is such a great Savior, He surely cannot save such a great sinner as I."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>George Whitefield</H2><P>This extraordinary evangelist, who is as famous as John Wesley, when he was dying said:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Oh, may I be able to lie down and die in the labor of my Lord, for I consider it worthwhile to die for this. If I have a thousand bodies, every one of these bodies will be a wandering evangelist for Jesus.</P><P>The last time he retired to rest, holding a candle, there was a big flock of people surrounding his doorway, asking him to preach to them once more. He knew that he was dying that day, yet he preached to them until the candle burned out, and then he went upstairs to die. When this man talked about himself, he said:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In the fulfilling of all our responsibilities there is always corruption mixed within it; therefore, after our repentance, if Jesus Christ would only receive us according to our deeds; then our deeds would surely condemn us because we cannot offer a prayer which is as perfect as that required by the moral law of God. I do not know how you might think; but I can say that I cannot pray, I can only sin; I cannot preach to you or to others, I can only sin; I can only say this: even my repentance needs repenting again; even my tears need to be washed in the precious blood of my Redeemer. The best deeds we have are but sins with spectacles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Augustus Toplady</H2><P>This very godly person, when he counted his sins, considered that every second he committed at least one sin. That is to say that in ten years, there were more than three hundred million sins. Therefore, he wrote that glorious hymn which caused millions of people, who were tired and oppressed by sin, to find rest-"Rock of Ages, cleft for me, / Let me hide myself in Thee"! He wrote:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Oh, is there one as pitiable as I in this world! Besides weakness and sin I have nothing. In my flesh there is no good thing, and how surprising that I could be tempted to view myself so high. The best work I have done in my life only qualifies me to be condemned.</P><P>But when he was dying of tuberculosis in London, he leaned his sinful head on the breast of the Savior and said, "I am the happiest man in this world."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Jonathan Edwards</H2><P>He was a very spiritual man who was greatly used by the Lord. Whenever he preached, countless people wept for their sins, as if pricked in their hearts, and asked forgiveness of the Savior. He was a most honest man, so he wrote the following very humbly:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>I often feel most deeply how I myself am filled with sins and filth; very often because this feeling is too strong, I cannot help but cry aloud. Sometimes I cry for so long, so that I have no alternative but to lock myself up often. Now I feel very deeply the wickedness of myself and the corruption of my heart, even more severely than before my conversion. Speaking of myself, I have long felt that my wickedness is completely incurable; it fills my thoughts and imaginations. Yet at the same time I feel that my sensitivity toward sins is too little and too slight; I am surprised that I actually cannot have more sensitivity toward sins. What I most hope for now is to be able to have a contrite heart and to most humbly prostrate myself before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>David Brainerd</H2><P CLASS=INDENT1>Oh that the things that were seen and heard in this extraordinary person, his holiness, heavenliness, labor, and self-denial in life, his so remarkably devoting himself and his all, in heart and practice, to the glory of God, and the wonderful frame of mind manifested, in so steadfast a manner, under the expectation of death, and the pains and agonies that brought it on, may excite in us all a due sense of the greatness of the work we have to do in the world, the excellency and amiableness of thorough religion in experience and practice, and the blessedness of the end of such.</P><P>These are the words of Jonathan Edwards at the burial of David Brainerd, who became his son through the gospel. When Brainerd was twenty-five years old, he labored among the poor Indians in the heart of the forest in America. He labored, he suffered, he prayed, he fasted until the Spirit of God was poured upon them, so that many repented, turned to the Lord, and lived for the Lord. Five years later, he rested.</P><P>Yet concerning himself, he sighed this way, "Oh, the filth within me! Oh, my shame and sins before God! Oh, the pride, selfishness, hypocrisy, ignorance, bitterness, party zeal, and the lack of love, candor, gentleness, and peace that have attended my attempts to promote the interests of religion!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Hudson Taylor</H2><P>The head of the China Inland Mission in Canada, Mr. Frost, was a co-worker of Hudson Taylor for decades. He said that he prayed with Hudson Taylor hundreds or even thousands of times, yet not once did he hear Mr. Taylor pray without confessing his sins.</P><P>These are men who drew close to God more than others; yet surprisingly, they had these kinds of feelings about themselves. Let me ask a question. Can ordinary believers, who are not as close to God as these and do not sense their own corruption, be more advanced than these men? Everyone would answer, No. If they do not sense their shortcomings, it does not mean that they are good. On the contrary, this only shows that they lack the enlightenment of self-knowledge. The reason that these men could sense their own unworthiness was because they were especially close to God. They received more of the light of God than others. They knew the absolute measure of the holiness of God. Therefore, they felt their own shortcomings more than the others. First John tells us: "But if we walk in the light...the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin" (1:7). Because we are in the light, sins are manifested and the blood of Jesus becomes necessary. Then it continues: "If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (v. 8). Those who say that they have no sin are self-deceivers. The reason that they can deceive themselves is because truth-the truth that comes from the light of God-is not in their heart. Only those without the enlightening of God will consider themselves to be good, holy, perfect, and sinless. If we draw close to God as these men did, then we will surely also sense our own filthiness. The more we draw close to God, the higher our measure of holiness and the more we will know what is filthy, corrupt, and unrighteous.</P><P>The depth of our feeling toward sin varies with the amount of the light of God that we have received. We did not consider many things to be sin at the start of our Christian living. When we progressed in grace, we understood those things were also sins. Many things which we considered right last year, we discovered were wrong this year because we have received more of the light of God. Perhaps many things which you now consider as acceptable will appear wrong when more of God and His intention is unfolded to you. There is not one Christian in the world who is completely without fault. We have to be careful and not be deceived by the flesh in thinking that we have now attained "sinless perfection."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FUTURE JUDGMENT</H2><P>We know that we Christians have to stand before the judgment seat of Christ in the future and be judged. This judgment does not decide whether or not we shall be saved for eternity. It decides whether or not we can enter into the kingdom and what will be our place in the kingdom. This judgment by the Lord concerns our daily living and work which we have after we are saved. Whether or not we shall receive praise from God in the future depends on whether or not we have obeyed the will of God today. Aside from His will, God is pleased with nothing else. Whether or not we receive a reward is a small matter, but whether or not the Lord's heart is pleased and satisfied is a big question. I believe that every saved person has a common desire to please the Lord, though the degree of the earnestness of this desire might differ.</P><P>Among many believers who want to "gain Christ," some often carelessly say that this is the will of God or that is the will of God; or I feel that this is God's leading or that is God's leading. Beloved, do you know that these things have to go through the judgment of God in the future? It is not what we say that counts, nor what we feel that counts. It is not what we consider or believe that counts; rather, it is a matter of whether or not our work is really out of the will of God. First Corinthians 3 tells us the way we will be judged in the future: "The work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one's work, of what sort it is." (v. 13). What is this fire? We know the function of fire. Sometimes it is used to burn, but often it is used to illuminate. For the work of wood, hay, and stubble, the fire is for burning. But for the work of gold, silver, and precious stones, the fire is for illuminating. If we put this verse together with Revelation 1:14, which describes how the eyes of the Lord of judgment are like a flame of fire, we can understand more the meaning of this fire. When we are judged in the future, the Lord will use His fire to test our work, to manifest our work. This fire is His eyes which are like flaming fire. This means that the Lord will judge through His light and according to His view all the work we have done after we were saved. His light will reveal what is according to His will and what is not.</P><P>Let us be assured that before God there is only one right or wrong, and there is only one standard of right and wrong. This standard is absolute, perfect, unchangeable, and unmovable. We will be judged in the future according to this standard. No matter what we say, how we feel, what we believe, or what we think, if our walk is not really of the will of God today, then in that day we will surely suffer loss. In the light of God, not only will it be impossible for anything to be hidden, but it will also be impossible for anything to be wrong. Today if we do not have the light of God to reveal our real condition and to tell us whether or not a matter fits His will, then in that day when God will judge through His light and according to His will, we will surely be unable to stand. If we have the shining of God in every aspect and we know His will (whether it is towards ourselves, towards others, or towards a certain thing) while we live on this earth, then in that day our work will surely receive a reward. Let us be assured that the light of God we receive for work today will be the light which God will use to judge us in the future. Therefore, if we want to know whether or not our work can stand in the light of God in that day, then we must ask whether or not our work today is done according to the light of God. Let me tell you, the light of God never changes. Whatever the light of God condemns and considers as contrary to His will today, the light of God will surely condemn and consider contrary to His will in the future. Whatever the light of God approves and considers in agreement with His will today, the light of God will also approve and consider in agreement with His will in the future. We should never risk the danger of walking contrary to the light of God, neglecting the will of God, and ignoring the view of God, while wishing to receive a reward at the day of the revelation of God's light.</P><P>What we daily live by now is the light of God. When we say that we are now walking according to the light of God, we mean that we are walking according to the judgment of God and that we have a clear vision of how God will judge our daily walk in the future. Since we are so clear concerning the situation at the coming judgment seat, we should be compelled before God, through this knowledge, to do that which will receive praise from Him, rather than that which will be condemned by Him at that day. The light of God is the light before the judgment seat. If we know ourselves through the light of God and walk according to the knowledge of His will through the light of God, then we know ourselves through the light before the judgment seat and walk according to the knowledge of His will through the light before the judgment seat. We ought to thank and praise God because we do not have to wait until that day to see the light of God and know how He will judge us. Today we already have the possibility of seeing the light. Today we already may know what He will condemn in the future and what He will approve in the future. The Holy Spirit comes to dwell in our heart to reveal the light of God; therefore, our responsibility is inexcusable.</P><P>Paul considered the future judgment of God to be according to the light of God. He told us that the things done according to our feelings were worthless. Therefore he said: "For I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord. So then do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God" (1 Cor. 4:4-5). This portion of the Bible cannot be more clear. Brothers, if the feeling of a man such as Paul was unreliable, who knew of no wrong in himself and still did not regard himself as justified, how about you and me? He said that unless God shines upon us with light in that day, there are many hidden things and thoughts which can influence our actions and cause us to walk our own ways. In that day when God shines on us, then we will know how much we were influenced by that which was hidden. Therefore, he told us in the previous verses that besides being faithful, he had nothing. If we set ourselves to be faithful, willing to pay any price to obey the will of God, then God will surely tell us His will so that we will know what to do. The Lord Jesus said, "If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know" (John 7:17).</P><P>Therefore, brothers, if we seek the light of God now on earth, when we see this light manifested in the future, we will not be condemned, but rather we will receive a reward of full satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PRAYER</H2><P>We know how important it is to obey the will of God. But if we want to know His will, we must have a heart before God that is willing to do His will. Our heart must be weaned from everything. We must have only one desire before God, that is, to know the desire of His heart. No matter what God reveals, we are willing to receive it. In this kind of condition and with this kind of tender and obedient heart, God will surely tell us His will. "The intimate counsel of Jehovah belongs to those who fear him; / And His covenant He will make known to them" (Psa. 25:14).</P><P>Many times we do not know our heart. We do not know how treacherous, how crooked, and how rebellious our heart is. We think that we are willing to obey, that we really desire the will of God, but we do not realize that in the deepest part of our heart there are hidden motives and self-will. Therefore, we must cry as David cried before God, "Examine me, O Jehovah, and try me; / Test my inward parts and my heart" (Psa. 26:2). "Search me, O God, and know my heart: / try me, and know my thoughts: / and see if there be any wicked way in me, / and lead me in the way everlasting" (Psa. 139:23-24). Only when God searches us and knows our heart will we know our heart. Only when God tries us and knows our thoughts will we know our thoughts. When we pass through this kind of searching and trying by God, we will be able to see if there is any wicked way in us-any wicked intentions, so that we may deal with them and be led of God to walk the way of eternal life. Many believers want to understand the will of God. They ask God to tell them His will. Yet they have not received it. There is no reason other than they have wicked ways in their hearts, which makes it impossible for God to lead them. They do not know themselves. They do not know how much inclination, how much opinion, how much fear, and how much lust are in their own hearts. These make it impossible for God to reveal His will. If before God they would ask Him to shine upon them, grant them self-knowledge, and then remove their obstacles, God would surely lead them. Although self-knowledge cannot immediately make known the will of God, self-knowledge can make known what is hidden in us that frustrates the understanding of God's will. Therefore, self-knowledge is indispensable in understanding the will of God. Without the light of God, who can know himself? Therefore, is it not the time for us now to pray the same way as David prayed?</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ANNOUNCEMENT<br>FOR OUR SECOND CONFERENCE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 20</H2><P>"Jesus is Lord!" (1 Cor. 12:3).</P><P>We will hold a special conference this year from October 8th (Thursday) to the 18th (the Lord willing). The purpose of this conference is to unite all the believers in every place who are of the same mind to wait before God and receive the message which will come from Him. Past experience tells us that we must all receive deeper edification. For this reason, we must lay much emphasis on the testimony of "the victory of Christ" which the Lord has committed to us. May those who intercede before the Lord pray in one accord for this conference that we may genuinely have the power which is purely of the Holy Spirit with no mixture of soulish power whatsoever. Amen!</P><P>We are very glad that Brother Wang Lien-chun has promised to be with us in this conference.</P><P>As to the schedule of this conference, we have already put out a separate announcement. If anyone has not received it yet, please write to Mr. Chow Shing-yee, P.O.

A certain believer once said that the whole Bible is like a ring studded with a precious stone. The book of Romans is the precious stone on the ring, and chapter eight is like the light that shines from that stone. This may seem descriptive, but those who have experience will admit that it is true. Although Romans 8 is very clear, it is also very deep. Although it is very easy, at the same time, it is very hard. Romans 8:1-4 occupies a special place in this chapter. There are four chapters in Romans which are quite important; they are chapters five through eight. Chapter five speaks of forgiveness in Christ. Chapter six speaks of union in Christ. Chapter seven speaks of the flesh not being able to keep the law of God. And chapter eight speaks of the fulfillment of the righteousness of God's law in Christ. Romans 8:1-4 embodies the meaning of these four chapters. Verse 1 speaks of having no condemnation in Christ. Verse 2 speaks of union in Christ. Verse 3 speaks of that which the law could not do because it was weak through the flesh. Finally, verse 4 speaks of being able to do in Christ what otherwise could not be done. Hence, these four verses are the crystalization of the salvation that we have received.</P><P>Before I speak on verses 1 through 4, I would like you to pay attention to one thing. What does Romans 7 speak about? Romans 7 says that "to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not" (v. 18). Brothers and sisters, is this not true? Many times, we make up our mind to do good, but we cannot work out our will. We know to do good, but we cannot do it. We do not want to love the world and we want to serve God, yet we cannot. Romans 7 can be summarized by one word: "cannot." Please remember that above every person's head the word "cannot" is written in big letters. If you have never tried to do good, you will not realize your inability. But if you seriously try to overcome, you will find that you cannot. Not only are you unable to perform things as profound as serving God, but you cannot even do a small thing such as getting up early in the morning to pray. You may want to read the Bible uninterruptedly every day of the year, but you cannot. These may be small things. Yet many Christians cannot do them. They may be able to do them for a day or two. At most they can do them for a week, after which they fail again. You may be well aware of a sin, yet you cannot remove the sin. For example, you may have a temper which is very difficult to overcome. There was once a believer with a bad temper who knew that he should not have such a temper. One day, one of the best vases in his house was broken by his servant. He was afraid of losing his temper if he looked at the broken vase, so he went to bed and covered his head with a blanket. But what is the difference between a temper under the blanket and a temper outside the blanket? Many Christians want to speak truthfully and not exaggerate. Yet they cannot. They fall once and they fall twice. Although they do not want to fall again, they find themselves falling still. They do not want to love the world. Yet they cannot avoid it. They want to live fully for God. Yet they cannot. Although they want to work for God, their hearts are distracted whenever they think of what others have achieved. Numerous experiences have proven to us that we cannot. In Romans 7, Paul told us only one thing: "cannot." He was desperate, and he said, "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" (v. 24). Brothers and sisters, how many of you sitting here want to be free from jealousy and pride, and find that you cannot do it? How many of you do not want to love the world and find that you cannot stop loving the world? How many of you have willed to do good and found that you cannot do good? How many of you have failed once, twice, until you have given up trying to overcome? Is this word of mine merely a law which does nothing but serve as a mirror to expose you? No, here is the gospel.</P><P>Romans 8:1 says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus." "Now" means that yesterday is over and that there is a way. Now in Christ there is a way. How precious this is!</P><P>A scholar in Greek demonstrated that according to reliable manuscripts the word condemnation has two kinds of usages. The first is in the legal sense, while the other is in the civil sense. The civil sense is the common usage. According to the civil sense, the word condemnation means "powerless," and "restricted." Brothers and sisters, from this verse we can find immeasurable comfort! Indeed, a person who is in Christ is no longer condemned legally, and as far as his flesh is concerned, he is powerless no more. There are no more restrictions in Christ. What Paul complained he was unable to do can, now be done in Christ.</P><P>Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." Please notice that it speaks of two laws here: the law of the Spirit of life and the law of sin and of death. Why does it say "the law of the Spirit of life" in Christ frees us from "the law of sin and of death," rather than "the Spirit of life" frees us from "sin and death"? What is the difference between "the Spirit of life" and "the law of the Spirit of life"? What is the difference between "sin and death" and "the law of sin and of death"?</P><P>Sin is an inward power. The law of sin is the habit of sin. For example, there is the force of gravity. Whenever we drop something, it is attracted by the force of gravity. The force of gravity becomes a law because it pulls down everything by habit. If I drop a book here, it will fall to the ground. If I drop the book in another place, it will still fall to the ground. This is the effect of a law. If a book falls when it is dropped here, but does not fall when it is dropped elsewhere, then it is not governed by a law. Anything habitual, anything that produces the same result from the same action is a law.</P><P>Sin is one thing, and the law of sin is another. We sin because within us there is the law of sin. This is like a book falling to the ground because there is the law of gravity. Brothers and sisters, have you seen this? Our sinning is a law. We do not sin or fall by accident. To sin is a habit, and to fall is a habit. Both sinning and falling have become a law. A law is something that will give the same result anywhere and in every way when given the same action. If our sinning is accidental and not caused by a law of sin, there are still ways to solve it. For example, if you sin because your environment is bad or your job is bad, you can change the environment or change jobs, and you will then stop sinning. But brothers and sisters, this book, the Bible, tells us that we do not sin by accident, but by a law of sin. Suppose you lose your temper easily. You would lose your temper easily in Shanghai, and you would lose your temper easily even if you go to Hangchow. You lose your temper easily in your business. But if you change your job, you will still lose your temper easily. No matter when or where, your temper will break out. Brothers and sisters, the Bible shows us that a law of sin has firmly grasped us. It may be possible to overcome sin, and it may be possible to overcome death, but it is impossible to overcome the law of sin and of death!</P><P>Why does the Bible say "the law of sin and of death" instead of "the law of sin" and "the law of death"? This is because sin and death are just one law. The law of sin and of death are not two laws, but two aspects of one law. With respect to sin, this law has a habit to positively commit many sins. With respect to death, this law deprives one of the power to keep the demands of the law. This is on the negative side. Many people do not understand the meaning of "death." "Death" means to be weak to the uttermost, to be without any strength, and to be without life. Death is a law because weakness and powerlessness are our habitual experience. Romans 7 emphasizes these two things. Paul said, "I do not do the good which I will"-this refers to death, and "the evil which I do not will, this I practice"-this refers to sin (v. 19). All the problems we encounter daily within ourselves are the result of the law of sin and of death. Many times, we do not have the strength to do what we desire to do, and we do not have the strength to not do what we do not want to do.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we need to see how evil the law of sin and of death is! Not only should we hate sin, but we should hate the law of sin and of death. We are so helpless before this law. But praise and thank the Lord, He has a total salvation. God's salvation does not deal with our individual sins. God's salvation deals with the root, the law. Formerly, when we encountered the same temptations, we produced the same results. But we do not have to have the same results now. This is the difference between having the law of the Spirit and not having the law of the Spirit. Apart from this, there is no victory.</P><P>Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." Where are we freed from the law of sin and of death? We are freed in Christ Jesus. I have to say "Hallelujah! All is well in Christ Jesus." The Bible does not say that in Christ we will be condemned, nor does it say that in Christ we will sin. It says that in Christ there is no more condemnation, and in Him we are free.</P><P>What does it mean to be in Christ? To be in Christ means to be joined to Him. We cannot be joined to Christ by ourselves, but when Christ died, God joined us in His death. We have died in the death of Christ and have been resurrected in the resurrection of Christ. When we believed in Christ, we believed into Christ. John 3:16 says, "That every one who believes into Him...would have eternal life." To believe means to believe into. By faith we are joined into Christ. Romans 6:3 says, "All of us who have been baptized into Christ..." When we believe and are baptized, that baptism puts us into Christ. This is faith. Although you cannot understand how you have been joined to Christ, it does not matter, for when you were baptized through faith, God joined you to Christ. There is not one saved Christian who is not in Christ; every one of them is in Christ.</P><P>What have we received in Christ? Romans 8:1-2 reveals two things were done that are most precious, and for which we can thank and praise God! Christ dealt with our sins through His crucifixion, and Christ dealt with our death-our utter spiritual weakness-through His resurrection from the dead. In the same way that Christ overcame sin, we will overcome sin. In the same way that Christ overcame death, we will overcome death. We are freed in Christ, which means that we are liberated in Christ and are delivered from the law of sin and of death.</P><P>I do not know what kind of law you have inside that does particular things, but I know that within you there is a law of sin and of death. You have your own particular law of sin and of death, but I can tell you that the law of the Spirit of life has freed you in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. The law of the Spirit of life is the law of resurrection, which is the same law that caused the Lord to resurrect from the dead. The life that we received on the day we believed in the Lord is a resurrection life; it is also the regenerating life. When we believed in the Lord, we received not only a resurrection, we also received the law of the Spirit of life. This law frees and delivers us from the law of sin and of death. When we believed in the Lord, the Holy Spirit entered into our heart and dispensed to us the Lord's life which overcomes sin and death, so that we can overcome sin and death through the Spirit of life. Brothers and sisters, perhaps you do not understand this, but that is all right. All that you have to do is to lay hold of God's Word. You can say to God, "Your Word says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." Does the Bible say that we are about to be freed? No. Does it say that we will be freed? No! The Bible says, "Freed!" I was like one who was imprisoned, and the law of sin and of death chained me with a chain that was even stronger than a jailer's chains. The law of sin and of death surrounded me, more than a prison cell surrounds a prisoner. But now, the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ. I am like one who has been released from prison. When a man receives the order that he will be released from prison, does he come out joyfully or does he come out wailing and weeping? The minute he is released, the very same minute, he comes out joyfully. It is the law of the Spirit of life that has freed me and has delivered me from the law of sin and of death. The freeing is the work of the Spirit, while deliverance is the result we have received.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, would you hold onto God's Word by faith? Do you know how much this life includes? God not only saves you from sin and death, but He also saves you from the law of sin and of death. Are you ensnared by filthy thoughts, jealousies, and tempers? Would you believe that "the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death"? Let me ask, "Are you in Christ?" If you are in Christ, you are freed and delivered from the law of sin and of death. Would you believe that the sin that ensnared you, ensnared you even yesterday, has been unshackled in Christ? Even if you are the greatest sinner among one million people, would you believe that as soon as you lay hold of the Word, "the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death," that there is nothing that you cannot do? If I merely exhort you to be good today, what difference is there from the men of the world who exhort you to be moral and ethical? What difference is there from exhorting you to keep God's law? We thank God that the Bible tells us what God has done for us in Christ. As long as we believe, everything will be all right. There is not another way to victory in the whole world. You can buffet your body and deny yourselves. You may be able to overcome sin and death in this way. But you will not be able to overcome the law of sin and of death. Brothers and sisters, we can lift up our heads to thank the Lord, saying, "The law which causes me to constantly sin has been dealt with by You." There is no other way. All we have to do is to believe that, at the time we were saved, God freed us from the filthy and weak law through the Spirit in Christ. Once we believe, we overcome. As soon as we believe, the Holy Spirit will immediately work, and the law that has been enslaving us will not be able to control us any longer. I know that I have sinned, and I know the seriousness of the law of sin and of death. But I believe that in Christ the law of sin and of death will not have power over me.</P><P>Gravity is a law, but if you hold a book with your hand, the power of the hand overcomes the law of gravity. It does not mean that the law of gravity is removed; it merely means that another law has overcome it. In the same principle, the law of the Spirit of life frees me from the law of sin and of death. The law of sin and of death has not been annulled, but another law prevents me from being ensnared by the law of sin and of death. Consequently, I do not feel that there is a law of sin and of death. Suppose the government has a law that forbids robbery. If I never have the inclination to be a robber, the law has nothing to do with me. It does not mean that there is no such a law; it merely means that I have never wanted to be a robber; therefore, I never feel the existence of the law.</P><P>Sin is an outward act, while a law is an inward demand. If a man overcomes sin, he has only overcome isolated acts. If he overcomes the law of sin, he has overcome the demand of the law of sin. Suppose a man loves to drink. He can force himself once or twice not to drink, but he cannot remove from within him the desire for wine. I have a friend who was addicted to theatrical shows before he believed in the Lord. As soon as the gong and the drums sounded, he would be moved in his heart. Once in a village near our school, there was a theatrical show in honor of the idols, and the plays went on for three days and three nights. He attended the shows the whole time and did not go home for three days and three nights. When he became too tired, he fell on the floor and slept. After he woke up, he watched the shows again. He did this continuously for three days and three nights. After he believed in the Lord, the Lord delivered him from the law of sin and of death. Now he does not have to force himself not to go; there is something within him that makes him not want to go. This is how God delivers us from sin and death. God delivers man first from within so that man will not be bound by the inward law. After this, there will spontaneously be good conduct without.</P><P>God frees us from the law of sin and of death; He does not make the law of sin and of death depart from us. Suppose that I do not want this book to fall on the ground. I do not have to exert all of my strength to remove the force of gravity. All I have to do is to hold this book. The law of gravity may still be there, but the gripping force in my hand has overcome it. Although the law of gravity is still there, it has been made of no effect. God's way of salvation is not to remove the fiery serpents, but to set up the bronze serpent (John 3:14).</P><P>We thank and praise God that He can save us to such an extent that we can overcome the demand of the law of sin. Even if I have not given a good sermon today, as long as you hold onto God's Word, everything will be all right. God says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. I have been freed from the law of sin and of death. From now on, I am a freed man. However, after you have believed this way, and you have gone home, the law of sin may appear to still be there. You may ask yourself, "In the meeting I believed that I am freed from the law of sin and of death. Why does it seem to still be there?" At such times Satan will come and accuse you, saying, "What difference has believing made to you? When you did not believe, you were like this. Now that you believe, you are still like this." At such times your faith is being tested. If you ignore your feelings and the accusations at such times, you will overcome. You cannot keep yourself by being more cautious or alert. God's word will keep you. What God says counts. When the first temptation comes and you stand fast, you have overcome. God has to test your faith to see if it is real, and you also have to test if the salvation in God's Word is real. If the faith is not real, you will not receive God's blessing. But if we believe and say to God, "I hold onto Your Word. What You say counts. For this reason, I believe that I am freed from the law of sin and of death." When God removes the veil, you will see what facts have been accomplished in Christ. Please remember that your eyes have to be set on God and not on yourselves. The Bible has never asked you to look at yourselves or to look at your experience. The righteous live by faith. We need faith to be saved, and we need faith to overcome. We have to glorify God at the time of temptations. Satan will say, "After all the believing, you are still the same." You have to say, "After all that you have done, I still believe." Satan will say, "God's Word may not be true." You have to say, "God's Word is true, and only the devil is a liar."</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I truly feel that it is easy to tell people to do good, but it is most difficult to exhort people to believe in God's Word. I have to tell you that without believing in God's Word, there is no victory.</P><P>Why does verse 1 say that we are no longer powerless in Christ? Verse 2 explains the reason clearly. The reason is that we are in Christ and freed from the law of sin and of death. The reason for our powerlessness and bondage is the law of sin and of death. This law has entangled us and has caused us to do the things that we wish not to do. When we are in Christ, His resurrection life and the Holy Spirit free us and deliver us from the law of sin and of death. When we are in Christ, we are no longer powerless. But we have to remember that this freeing is in Christ. Therefore, this experience of no longer being powerless must also be in Christ. We cannot expect God to do something within us that will make us feel that we are quite good, sufficient, and can now overcome. There is no such a thing. We can only have the experience of no longer being powerless when we are in Christ. Once we are out of Christ, we are as powerless as before. This is why John 15 commands us to abide in Christ all the time.</P><P>Romans 8:3 states, "For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh." This verse tells us that since the law could not do anything because it was weak through the flesh, God sent the Lord Jesus to the world to accomplish the work of redemption. On the one hand, He became a sacrifice for sin and died for us. On the other hand, He brought our sins to the cross and judged them there. In this way, sin has power no more.</P><P>Romans 8:4 states, "That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit." This verse tells us that when we are in Christ, we will fulfill the righteous requirement of the law, accomplish God's will, and please God. Thank and praise the Lord. We believe today, we have power today, and we have victory.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JEHOVAH</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 21</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Exo. 3:13-18</H1><P>There are many precious portions in the Bible. This morning God has given me light from this portion of the word and has nourished me. I would like, therefore, to share with you what I have received.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD AND JEHOVAH</H2><P>One thing that we should notice in the Bible is that God's name is not used carelessly. Every time God mentions His name, it is with a purpose. Every time God uses His name, it is not used carelessly. Even the name Jesus is very meaningful and is not used haphazardly. For example, there is Jesus Christ, there is Christ Jesus, and there is the Lord Jesus Christ, etc. If we change Jesus Christ to Christ Jesus, we will be wrong doctrinally. The same is true of the name which God reveals to man. In Exodus 3:13-18 God purposely points out that besides being God, His name is Jehovah. This reveals His relationship with Israel. What is the difference between God and Jehovah? Let us first consider how God revealed Himself through His name in Genesis. From this we can find out the meaning of His names. From Genesis to Exodus 3, God used different names to reveal Himself. He used at least three names to reveal himself. In Genesis 1 He uses the name God. In Genesis 2 He uses a different name- not God, but Jehovah God. Why does Genesis 1 use God while Genesis 2 uses Jehovah God? The amazing thing is that God did not tell man the meaning of the name Jehovah. Although Abraham knew the name (because God told him once that His name was Jehovah), he never knew the meaning of the name. Not until Exodus 3:14-15 did God begin to tell man the meaning of the name Jehovah.</P><P>Why does Genesis 1 not mention Jehovah or Jehovah God, but only God? The name God-Elohim-means the strong and mighty One. The name God has to do with the creatures; it refers to His relationship with the creation. But Jehovah is a name that is related to man. Genesis 2 speaks of the relationship between God and man. Therefore, Jehovah God is mentioned right away. This speaks of God's relationship with man. In Genesis 1 we do not see man. Even when the creation of man is mentioned on the sixth day, the emphasis is still on creation. This is why the name God is used. In Genesis 2 we see man, and so it speaks of Jehovah God. Every time the word Jehovah God is used, it denotes God having a relationship with man. Every time the word God is used, it implies His power and His relationship with the creation. Let us now consider a few portions of the Word to show the difference between God and Jehovah.</P><P>"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord [i.e. Jehovah] shut him in" (Gen. 7:16). Can you see the difference here? All those that went in the ark went in male and female, as God had commanded, and Jehovah shut Noah in the ark. Can we change it around? No, we cannot. It was God who commanded. A command has to do with God's authority. Therefore, the name God is used here. But after man came, Jehovah rather than God shut him in. This is because shutting in has to do with God's care. This shows a difference in usage between God and Jehovah.</P><P>"This day will the Lord [i.e. Jehovah] deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel" (1 Sam. 17:46). Here it says that Jehovah would "deliver thee into mine hand," for the purpose that "all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel." Does it say that "God will deliver thee into mine hand...that all the earth will know that there is a Jehovah?" No! The reason is that Jehovah is related to us; He cares for us and delivers the enemy into our hand. Moreover, God does not tell all the earth, those outside Israel, that He is Jehovah; He only shows them that He is God. Jehovah speaks of a relationship with those who are close to God, while God speaks of a relationship with ordinary men, in which He reveals His power to men.</P><P>"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord [Jehovah] helped him; and God moved them to depart from him" (2 Chron. 18:31). The One who helped Jehoshaphat was Jehovah, while the One who moved his enemy was God. Jehovah helped Jehoshaphat because he was close to God and intimate with God. God used the title God to Jehoshaphat's enemy because they had no relationship with Him. This is another example.</P><P>God is the common name, while Jehovah is the name of intimacy. God refers to His power, while Jehovah refers to His love. God refers to creation, while Jehovah refers to His intimacy. Genesis 1 does not mention Jehovah because it covers the creation. Even when chapter one mentions man, it is in relation to creation and power. Genesis 2 speaks of God's intimacy with man and His relationship with man; therefore, it mentions Jehovah God. Why does it say Jehovah God in chapter two, instead of just Jehovah? This proves that the Jehovah in chapter two is the God in chapter one. Jehovah God is not only the One who is powerful, but is also the One who draws near to man. However, even though the name Jehovah is used from Genesis 2 until Exodus 3, the meaning of the name Jehovah is not explained until Exodus 3:14.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I AM JEHOVAH</H2><P>"And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations" (Exo. 3:14-15). This was God's response to Moses' question about what he should say to the Israelites if they asked about the name of the God of their forefathers when he told them that the God of their forefathers had sent him to them. God told Moses that He is "I am that I am" (i.e., Jehovah), which means the self-existing and the ever-existing One. It was Jehovah who had sent Moses. What was His name? His name was "I am that I am." Who had sent Moses? The "I am" had sent him.</P><P>I am! I am that I am! Brothers and sisters, do you see the preciousness in this name? I feel its preciousness particularly today. I am... I am... I am... How wonderful! I am... Do you realize that God is...? God's Word is most amazing. What He says is most amazing, and what He has not said is also most amazing. What God has fully said is amazing, and what He has not fully said is also amazing. What He has spelled out is most amazing, and what He has only half-uttered is also most amazing. What God has said forthrightly is amazing, and what He has said hesitantly is also most amazing. Here God does not say fully what He is. He merely says that He is... This implies that there is something not yet said. The "I am" has sent Moses. On that day Moses received God's revelation.</P><P>If God adds the word power to the words I am, then He is not love. If He adds love to the first words, then He is only love and not power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, comfort, protection, a high tower, and shelter. God only says that He is, without saying what He is. This allows those who believe in Him to add in other terms; actually, they are not terms, they are spiritual realities! We can add in whatever we want by faith. If we have the need and faith, we can add whatever we need to the words God is and receive God's answer to our need. If we need comfort, God is our comfort. If we need a shelter, God is our shelter. If we need a high tower, God is our high tower. If we need victory, God is our victory. If we need holiness, God is our holiness. If we need a way, God is our way (John 14:6). If we need light, God is our light. If we need the bread of life, God is our bread of life. Whatever you need can be added to His name. We should not have any doubt. We can add whatever we want to His name.</P><P>This is like a checkbook with signatures on all the checks. When the checkbook is given to you, you can put in whatever amount you want. If you tear out one check and write one thousand on it, you will have one thousand. If you write ten thousand on it, you will have ten thousand. Since someone has signed them, all you have to do is write what you need on one of them. Many people do not know God, and many people do not know Jehovah. I feel that the length, the breath, the height, and the depth of this name are sufficient to include everything.</P><P>After seeing this, it is no wonder that those who know God say that the name of the Lord is a strong tower, and the righteous runs into it and is safe (Prov. 18:10). After we understand the meaning of this name, we will proclaim with David that "And those who know Your name put their trust in You" (Psa. 9:10). Because the Old Testament saints knew God's name as Jehovah, they were able to pray, "For the sake of Your name, O Jehovah, / Pardon my iniquity, for it is great" (25:11); "save me, O God, by thy name" (54:1); "do thou for me, O God the Lord, for thy name's sake" (109:21). They also proclaimed, "Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us" (44:5); "He guides me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake" (23:3); "I will lift up my hands in thy name" (63:4). This is why they could praise, saying, "According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise" (48:10); "in thy name shall they rejoice all the day" (89:16); "sing unto God, sing praises to his name...his name JAH" (68:4). God Himself also declared, "I will set him on high, because he hath known my name" (91:14).</P><P>God's name reveals God Himself. God's name is the foundation of our faith. If we can enter the reality of God's name in the power of the Holy Spirit, extraordinary things can be accomplished through God's name.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD JESUS IS JEHOVAH</H2><P>Some are ignorant about this matter; they think that Jehovah is God's revelation in the Old Testament and wonder if we can enjoy the benefit of this name in the New Testament. We thank God! Jehovah in the Old Testament is the Jesus in the New Testament. The meaning of Jesus is Jehovah our Savior.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He admitted that He was the Jehovah in the Old Testament. He said, "Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins" (John 8:24). In this verse the Lord Jesus tells us that He is the "I am."</P><P>A little later He said, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am" (v. 28). "Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am" (v. 58). The Lord Jesus clearly said that He was Jehovah. The Jews understood what this meant; therefore, "they picked up stones to throw at Him" (v. 59).</P><P>We can rejoice because our Lord Jesus is the I am. He is! He is everything for our sake. He is the I am! He says of Himself that He is the life, He is the resurrection, He is the light of the world, He is the bread of life, and He is the good shepherd. We can derive all kinds of supply from the Lord's name. Once we have His name, we have everything. We thank the Lord that He has given this name to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JEHOVAH</H2><P>"Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The Lord [Jehovah] God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Cannanites...unto a land flowing with milk and honey" (Exo. 3:16-17). This name was especially used during the journey from Egypt to Canaan. During this journey the name "I am" is used. From the time we were saved until the time of the kingdom, no matter how many tribulations we pass through, Jehovah is still the I am. He is the one that is called "I am that I am." Friends, during the journey that began at the time we were saved until the coming kingdom, Jehovah's name is enough to lead us through everything. Jehovah is not God's name in creation. Jehovah is God's name for the believers in the wilderness. It is the name in the wilderness and the name that will bring us through the wilderness into Canaan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BELIEVERS' RESPONSIBILITY</H2><P>What effect does the name Jehovah have on the Israelites? It makes the Israelites responsible before God for their conduct.</P><P>God does not reason. If God ever reasoned with man, man would never prevail against God. One prophet in the Old Testament said that God overcomes even when He is judged (Rom. 3:4). God's reasoning is too deep, and man can never come up to it. God does not reason; He Himself is the reason. We can consider a few examples from Leviticus and Numbers:</P><P>"You shall do My ordinances and keep My statutes to walk in them: I am Jehovah your God" (Lev. 18:4).</P><P>"You shall keep My statutes and My ordinances, which if a man do he shall live by them: I am Jehovah" (18:5).</P><P>"I am Jehovah" (18:6b).</P><P>"I am Jehovah your God" (18:30b).</P><P>"Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel and say to them, You shall be holy, for I, Jehovah your God, am holy" (19:2).</P><P>"Do not turn to idols, or make for yourselves molten gods: I am Jehovah your God" (19:4).</P><P>"You shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and for the alien: I am Jehovah your God" (19:10).</P><P>"And you shall not swear falsely by My name, and so profane the name of your God: I am Jehovah" (19:12).</P><P>"You shall not curse the deaf, or put a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God: I am Jehovah" (19:14).</P><P>"You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand up against the life of your neighbor: I am Jehovah" (19:16).</P><P>"You shall not take vengeance, or bear a grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am Jehovah" (19:18).</P><P>"I am Jehovah your God" (19:25b).</P><P>"You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, neither shall you put any tattoos on you: I am Jehovah" (19:28).</P><P>"You shall keep My sabbaths, and you shall reverence My sanctuary; I am Jehovah" (19:30).</P><P>"Do not turn to the mediums and spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them: I am Jehovah your God" (19:31).</P><P>"You shall rise up before the greyheaded, and honor the aged; you shall fear your God: I am Jehovah" (19:32).</P><P>"The alien who sojourns with you shall be to you as the native among you; you shall love him as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God" (19:34).</P><P>"You shall observe all My statutes and all My ordinances and do them: I am Jehovah" (19:37).</P><P>"Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be Mine: I am Jehovah" (Num. 3:45).</P><P>Is there any reason to God's command? You must not sin, "for I am Jehovah"! There is no other reason! I will scourge you and chastise you, because "I am Jehovah." "The Levites shall be Mine," because the Israelites owed God something? No, it is because "I am Jehovah." You shall not curse the deaf, because "I am Jehovah." You cannot this or that, because "I am Jehovah." There is no other reason. If anyone among us obeys God because He has said "I am that I am," he is blessed and will not sin. He can find many reasons in the world to sin. But because of one great reason: "I am that I am," he will not sin and will be blessed!</P><P>Simply put, there are two reasons for God being "I am that I am."</P><P>(1) I am; I am the powerful One. Therefore you cannot do it. I am; I am your power, protection, holiness, righteousness, and supply. Why do you have to sin? You may say, "I have lust within me." Jehovah says, "I am. I am righteousness and holiness. Why do you have to sin?" You may say, "I do not have money, therefore I have to borrow." Jehovah will say, "I am the One who supplies you. Why do you have to borrow? If you sin, it is not because I will not help you nor because I cannot protect you from sin. I am that I am. I can protect you. You sin because you want to sin."</P><P>(2) I am that I am. "I am not only power, wisdom, and the one who loves you and has chosen you. I am not only these. I am that I am, I am Jehovah, I am your God. If you do not do well, I will discipline you and chastise you. If you sin, I will chastise you." In the first point, He is the power. In the second point, He will judge. In the first case, He shows us that He is man's holiness and righteousness. In the second case, He shows us that Jehovah Himself is holy and righteous. He will judge us according to His holiness and righteousness. In using this name, it seems as if He will not reason with us. He told His people, "I am Jehovah, I am the Lord, therefore you cannot sin. I am Jehovah. I have brought you out of Egypt. I am Jehovah. I will bring you into Canaan. I am Jehovah, therefore you must not do any of these things."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM,<br>THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB</H2><P>"And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations" (Exo. 3:15).</P><P>Here is another matter. Who is this Jehovah your God? He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. As far as He is concerned, God is Jehovah, the I am. As far as man is concerned, Jehovah is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. On God's side, God is God, that is, Jehovah. This is God's revelation to man of what He is in Himself. On man's side, God revealed Himself through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In the same way that He was powerful in them, He is powerful in us.</P><P>Why did God not say, He is the God of Adam? Adam had sin, but so had Abraham. Why did He not call Himself the God of Adam? Why did He not call Himself the God of Abel, the descendant of Adam? Why did He rather say He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Why was the Lord Jesus a descendant of Abraham according to the flesh? Why did God call Himself the God of these three men among so many other men? Is it because these three men were somewhat different from others? In addition to the fact that God made a covenant with these three men, which made them special, they were representatives of men. God chose these three men to represent three kinds of people on earth today.</P><P>What kind of person was Abraham? He was a giant in faith. He was an uncommon and extraordinary person. God is the God of Abraham, meaning that God is the God of extraordinary and outstanding persons. But thank God, He is not only the God of Abraham. If God were only the God of Abraham, we would be disappointed, because none of us is an extraordinary and outstanding person. God is also the God of Isaac. What kind of person was Isaac? Isaac was an ordinary man. He was a man who would eat when you gave him food, who would sleep when you gave him a bed. He was not an extraordinary person. Nor was he an evil person. But God is also the God of ordinary persons. What a comfort this is to us! However, God is not just the God of ordinary men. He is also the God of evil men. He is the God of Jacob. Jacob is the most crafty man in the Bible. Through these three persons, God tells us that He is the God of Abraham (the best persons), the God of Isaac (the common persons), and the God of Jacob (the evil persons). He is God to those who are outstanding in their faith. He is God to those who are merely ordinary people. He is also God to the vilest among all men such as the robbers, the thieves, and the prostitutes. If I am one like Abraham, He is God to an extraordinary person like me. If I am an ordinary person like Isaac, He is also God to an ordinary person like me. If I am an evil person from my mother's womb, one who would argue with my brother, and who is evil from my youth, He will say that He is also God to an evil person like me. God is not just the God of Abraham. He is not just the God of Isaac. God is also the God of Jacob. Are you exceptionally good? God has a way with you. Are you an ordinary person? God has a way with you. Are you a particularly evil person? God also has a way with you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RESURRECTION</H2><P>From that day until now, God has always called Himself by this name; He has never changed. Even when the Lord Jesus was about to die, He declared that God is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is the God of the living, and that is why man will resurrect. Here the Lord added another meaning to the name. God called Himself this to show that He is the God of resurrection. Although Abraham was good, he still died and stunk. However, God will resurrect him. An ordinary person like Isaac also died and stunk. But God will also resurrect him. Although Jacob was crafty, he also died and stunk. But God will resurrect him also. In the realm of resurrection, all natural things will pass away. God is the God of the living; He is not the God of the dead, nor the God of those who are about to die. He is God to these three persons in the realm of resurrection. Therefore, every Christian is destined to deterioration, no matter how talented he is, how common he is, or how evil he is. Our God wants to reconstitute us, so that we will receive something new in Him. Although by our natural constitution we have many differences, God will not obliterate these things; He will be God to us just the same. He knows that what He sees is not our natural self, but the life that He gives us. Naturally speaking, there are many differences between Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But in resurrection, they have all received the life of God. God does not care for our natural constitution; He only cares for His own work in grace. Therefore, He can give grace to, use, and perfect men who are entirely different, treating them as if there were no difference at all among them.</P><P>What is the meaning of resurrection? It means the passing away of the natural and the coming of the supernatural. It means the passing away of the first and the coming of the second. Whether you are a talented person, an ordinary person, or a crafty and evil person, your eyes need not be set on your talent, your unattractiveness, or your craftiness. God can give you something new in His Son. God is showing us that everything natural and of man is useless. Only that which is supernatural and of God is useful. He said that He is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob because His eyes are on resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN ETERNAL MEMORIAL</H2><P>"This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations" (Exo. 3:15). This is My name forever. This means that I forever am. With Me, there is only one "I am." In this verse, the name Jehovah speaks of two things:</P><P>(1) I forever am Jehovah. As My name is, so will I be forever.</P><P>(2) My memorial. This is to make you remember that I am Jehovah forever, and I will also remember that I am Jehovah unto all generations. Unless God has forgotten that He Himself is Jehovah, and unless we also forget that He is Jehovah, He will forever be I am to us-He will be all that we need. Hallelujah!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRINCIPLE OF BEING THE SECOND</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 21</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:46-47; Gen. 17:18-19; 25:23; Rom. 9:12-13; Gen. 48:18-19; 1 Sam. 8:5; 16:1; 2 Sam. 12:14, 24-25</H1><P>The message that the Lord gives us this afternoon involves these few portions of the Word. These verses show us a principle that God reveals in the Bible. The subject of today's message can be called "The Principle of Being the Second" or "The Law of Being the Second."</P><P>In the portions that we have read, we can see that God chooses the second and not the first. First Corinthians 15:46-47 says that the first is earthy and the second is heavenly; the first is soulish and the second is spiritual. I have often considered that it is an amazing thing in the Bible that God always chooses the second one. Ishmael was the eldest son and older brother, and Isaac was the younger brother. Yet God chose Isaac. Esau was also the eldest son and older brother, and Jacob was the younger son and brother. But God chose Jacob, not Esau. Manasseh was the first son, and Ephraim was the second; yet God chose Ephraim. Bathsheba had two sons. God smote her first son and loved the second son, Solomon. God loved Solomon so much that He sent the prophet Nathan to give him the name Jedidiah which means "Jehovah's beloved." Our Lord was born from this lineage according to the flesh.</P><P>From the Bible, therefore, we see that God always chooses the second and not the first. This is not all. God did not want the first king, Saul; He chose David, the second king. God said that David was a man after His heart.</P><P>Why did God reject the older brother and prefer the younger? Why did God hate the first one and choose the second? This is what we have to find out.</P><P>God not only deals with the Israelites and the believers in this way, He also deals with sinners in this way. In Exodus, why did God want the Israelites to strike the blood on the side posts and on the upper doorpost for their firstborn? Why was the firstborn in danger and the secondborn not? Why did the Bible require the firstborn of the cattle and sheep to be redeemed, and if they were not redeemed, that their neck be broken? Breaking the neck damages the central nervous system and results in death. Why did the firstborn of the cattle and sheep need to be redeemed? Why did the secondborn of the cattle and sheep not need to be redeemed? Even the firstborn sons had to be redeemed, in addition to the firstborn of the cattle and sheep. The second son, however, did not need to be redeemed. If the firstborn was not redeemed with a price, he was not counted as one of God's people and had to be cut off. Why was God displeased with the firstborn? Why were they not favored? Why were the second sons loved by God? Why was God gracious to them? Why did He also cherish them? Why did God make the whole tribe of Levi the price of redemption for the firstborn of Israel? When the number was short, why did He demand silver to fill up the number? Why did God reject the first son and choose the second son?</P><P>We know that the Bible is not a careless record. The reason the Bible records things in a particular way reveals a very important principle, even though this principle may not be understood by many. God does not do things in a haphazard way. He repeatedly acts this way because this is His way. All of His acts are controlled by His ways. Therefore, if we can learn from this principle, we will greatly advance in our knowledge of God and spiritual things.</P><P>What is the significance of God choosing the second and rejecting the first? Let us read 1 Corinthians 15:46, "But the spiritual is not first but the soulish, then the spiritual." While 1 Corinthians 15 primarily speaks about the resurrection of the body, our purpose in reading this passage is not to focus on the resurrection of the body. Our focus is on the spiritual principle. According to this portion of the Scripture, there is first a soulish body and then a spiritual body. The principle here is that everything that comes first is soulish while everything that comes second is spiritual. This is the reason that God chooses the one that comes second and rejects the one that comes first.</P><P>What is the first? In John 3:3, "Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Then 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." The Lord Jesus was speaking of regeneration. The Lord said that it is not enough to be born once; a man must be born anew. He said that only one birth is not sufficient; a man cannot see the kingdom of God in this way. But if he is born anew, he will have eternal life and be able to see the kingdom of God. Following this, the Lord Jesus explained that the first birth is of the flesh. He also explained that the second birth is of the Spirit. The first is everything that comes from our flesh, our natural birth, and what we possess at the time of our natural birth. The second is everything that is not of the flesh, that is born of the Spirit, and that comes as a result of the birth of the Spirit.</P><P>Let us consider the many things that are included in that which is born of the flesh. We inherit these things from our parents. They include our emotion, talent, intelligence, and all the meekness, humility, love, peace, decisiveness, patience, etc. that come from our natural birth. All the virtues that we possessed before we received the Spirit and were regenerated, and everything that others consider to be most desirable are included in the category which the Lord Jesus calls "that which is born of the flesh." Brothers and sisters, we have to ask ourselves: Is everything that we have, after regeneration, born of God? Or are there still things that are born of the flesh? We should not consider that only sinful and filthy things are born of the flesh and that they are the only things that need to be removed. We should not consider our meekness, patience, loveliness, intelligence, and talent as things that we can retain and that do not need to pass through the process of being born of God. Do we realize that everything we can obtain and do and which can exist without the Holy Spirit, without believing in the Lord, or without trusting in God is inherited from the first? Do we realize that they are from the flesh and from our parents? All these things should be rejected and abandoned. Only the things which we can obtain and acquire and which exist through the Holy Spirit, through believing in the Lord, and through trusting in God are pleasing to God; they are what God desires.</P><P>Therefore, the first thing is regeneration. Blessed are those who have two lives! Blessed are those who have two natures! Some people say with their mouth that they believe in the Lord Jesus; they may even attend church services. But if all they have is what they inherited from their parents, they are still sinners destined for perdition. If all that a man has and is and all that he has acquired and obtained are but things that he has from his birth, he is a hopeless and useless person before God. If one believes in the Lord and acquires the second, he is regenerated, saved, and has eternal life.</P><P>Christians should pay attention to the difference between the first and the second. They should be able to differentiate between what they have inherited from their parents and what God has given to them through the Spirit. Many Christians have very confused views; they cannot differentiate between the first and the second. They do not know what is of the first and what is of the second. Many Christians think that if they are zealous, patient, and speak nice words, if they pray well, zealously distribute tracts, and save people, their life, living, nature, and work will be sufficient.</P><P>Please pay attention to what I am saying. I am not speaking what I do not know; I am speaking what I know. God does not care for our good work. God only cares about where our good work originates from. Where does the work originate? What is the source? Even though you have done some good, where does the goodness come from? This does not mean that God hates meekness; rather, we have to ask where the meekness comes from? Does it come from our self or does it come from the Holy Spirit? Where does our zeal come from? Does it come from our self or does it come from the Holy Spirit? What is the principle? The principle is that in everything we must ask if it comes from the first or the second. God always rejects the first and always approves the second. Therefore, you have to see whether your zeal comes from the first or the second.</P><P>Suppose I have a quick temper. When I see others being patient, I may admire them very much and commend them. But God is concerned about another matter. He would ask about the source of the strength for this patience. He would ask where the power behind this patience originated. When we see goodness in the first, we say that it is good. But God will only say that something is good if the goodness is from Him. Only what God considers to be good is truly good. When we see a preacher with a loud voice, clear enunciation, zest for work, and zeal for saving souls, we often say that he is spiritual. But God asks if these attributes are from the first or the second. A brother once said that Christians today have no discernment at all. When they see a preacher banging the podium with his fist, they say that he is very powerful! But where does his power come from? Any talent, strength, and natural attribute that comes from the first should not be trusted. God only wants what is acquired after regeneration; He wants everything that comes from the second.</P><P>Not only should a preacher reject what is from the first, but every believer should reject what is from the first. Natural goodness and patience are like rubber bands; when the rubber is stretched to the limit of its elasticity, it is no longer flexible. They can never match God. If anything is from God, it can be stretched indefinitely. A fleshly source cannot supply a spiritual need; this fact is certain. Adam cannot help Christ, and that which is of Adam cannot help that which is of Christ. Many people think that as long as they love others, everything will be "all right." But this "all right" is not enough; we still have to ask if this "all right" is given to you by God.</P><P>A brother once said that only what proceeds from heaven will go back to heaven. I think the reason we often say that heaven is our home is because all we are and have comes from heaven; this is why going to heaven is returning home. If all that we have is of the earth, then heaven must be a guest house and not our home! God can never receive what did not proceed from Him. This is certain.</P><P>Is there a difference between the day we first believed and today? Does being a Christian merely involve the removal of the sins, failures, weaknesses, filth, and other negative things that existed before we believed? If this were so, then others will say that being a Christian is just removing all that is bad. But this is not good enough for God. God does not disapprove of only bad things; he also disapproves of many good things. God does not just remove all that is bad; He rejects everything that comes from the first. God rejects not only the sin in the flesh; He also rejects the cleverness in the flesh. He not only rejects the filth of the flesh; He also rejects the goodness and righteousness of the flesh. God is not pleased with anything that comes from the first-the fleshly and natural life. Nothing of the first can mix with that which is new.</P><P>In the four Gospels we see the Lord Jesus telling men that if they do not love Him more than their father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and their own life, they were not worthy to be called His disciples. In another place the Lord said that if a man did not hate his own father, mother, wife, and children, he was not worthy to be His disciple. In Paul's Epistles he not only exhorts children to submit to their parents, but also for parents not to provoke their children. In another place we see a word for the husband and wife: the husband should love the wife and the wife should love the husband. The Gospels repeatedly say that we should hate, while the Epistles repeatedly say that we should love. If you cannot differentiate between the first and the second, and if you cannot differentiate between the flesh and the Spirit, you will not understand the meaning behind these words. If you cannot differentiate between the first and the second, the natural and the supernatural, you will think that you can treat your relatives any way you want when you read that the Lord said that he who does not love Him more than his father, mother, and children is not worthy to be called His disciple. When Paul says that parents, children, and couples should love one another, you will think that you can forget about everything else except loving your relatives. The Lord Jesus forbid natural love, while Paul commanded us to have spiritual love. If your love is natural, you will drift from the Lord, your fellowship will lessen, your love will be diverted, and your intimacy will be lost because of the relatives that you love. If you are willing to put your parents, wife, and children into God's hand, and if you are willing to hate them if God wants this, you will immediately be aware of God's second commandment, which is to love your parents, wife, and children. Then you will be delivered from the first and enter the second. Many people receive only the first half in the Gospels, while many others receive only the second half in Paul's writings. Both of them are wrong.</P><P>Brothers, our work and life must be delivered from the first. For example, it is easy to understand the terms fleshly and spiritual according to the letter, but it is difficult to differentiate between the two in our living. How can we tell if our goodness and righteousness come from the first or the second? Is there any mark that can help us clearly identify which is which? Let me tell you a law: everything that is spiritual has passed through death. Those who have experience will say "amen" to this. In other words, everything spiritual is in resurrection. Anything that comes from birth, that we can acquire without the need for God's strength, is of the first. All the cleverness, loveliness, goodness, and talents that we possess from the time of our birth until the time we believe in the Lord are considered to be fleshly by God. Everything that falls within this period cannot please God. Anything that God puts in after regeneration and that God adds to us through the Spirit from the time when we believed in the Lord Jesus is of the second. As far as natural virtues are concerned, they should be specifically rejected; we should not live by them and boast in them. Instead, we should trust helplessly in the Holy Spirit, looking to Him for guidance and beseeching Him for strength, victory, and the way to live out Christ. Everything that is of the second is from God and requires the specific denial of our own wisdom, strength, and natural abilities. Only after this denial do we have what is resurrected, spiritual, and from the second.</P><P>We have received too little of the second from God! We have lived too infrequently according to the second! What do we do all the time? We try to take away the evil things from the first and borrow the good things. But God says even though evil, filthy, and sinful things should be removed, our naturally clever, talented, meek, and lovely things should also be dropped and passed through death. We may think: if we should not use our own cleverness, should we be senseless? If we should not use our meekness, should we be blunt? No. It merely means that God wants to bring everything through death. For example, I may be a very clever person and may be able to find many new ideas in the Bible through my cleverness. However, I will not trust in my cleverness, but in God alone. I will trust in God in reading the Bible and in prayer. Without trusting in God, I can do nothing. The Bible says that "apart from Me you can do nothing" (John 15:5). If we do this nothing apart from Him, we will pass through death, and our self will be abandoned. We will see God use our renewed wisdom, and we will see God take and use everything that has passed through death and the cross.</P><P>This is indeed a suffering life! How painful is this type of life! If we live this way, we will lose all our freedom. We should not do anything quickly. We have to wait on God, pray more, and know our uselessness and corruption. Yet only this life is a fruit-bearing life. "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" (John 12:24). Many people are not willing to adopt this attitude. Therefore, they live in the first all their life. They never live in the second because their natural being has not died. Although they look good outwardly, they cannot bear genuine spiritual fruit. Consider the example of the Lord Jesus who did not know sin. If He had said anything by Himself, He would not have been wrong. If He had done anything by Himself, He would surely have done it well because He was sinless, clean, and without blemish. His life and nature was perfect. Yet He said that He could do nothing or say nothing by Himself. He only spoke what He heard from the Father. Why would He not do things according to Himself? He realized that to do this would be natural and not be according to God. Even a person like the Lord Jesus, whose natural being was perfect, clean, and beautiful, did not follow Himself. How much more we should do the same! The Lord came from heaven. He did not trust in His perfect flesh, but trusted in the Holy Spirit. How much more should we do the same! The way that He insisted on walking according to God's will and by the power of the Holy Spirit shows us that being sinless alone is not enough. Our life must not be one that merely overcomes sin; it must also overcome the flesh. It must not only overcome filthiness, but must overcome the natural being. God's life has been too suppressed by our natural being. Our life and work have been too controlled by our own will and too motivated by our own wisdom. We have tried to serve God by our own strength too much. God's calling today is that we see the futility of everything that comes from the natural realm so that we will humble and empty ourselves before God, obey, and trust in Him entirely.</P><P>I admit that this is a painful way! This life is a dependent life, a lowly life, a life of bondage, imprisonment, and slavery. This kind of life is a suffering life. If you live by the second, you will be humbled and bound as a prisoner and slave every day. But this is the only kind of life that pleases God. Only this kind of work is spiritually effective. Everything from the flesh, whether it is fleshly holiness or fleshly zeal, amounts to nothing in God's eyes as long as it comes from the natural instinct or emotional impulse.</P><P>Finally, let us remember that anything we can do, will do, or are able to do without much prayer, without a full trust in God, and without the power of the Holy Spirit, is not pleasing to God and will be surely condemned by Him because it is something from the flesh. All that we have must be received humbly through trusting in God. May we put the natural life to death daily by God's life until the day the Lord returns. May God's new creation swallow up our old creation.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 22</H2><P>Many readers have long awaited the publication of this twenty-second issue of The Present Testimony. After the publication of the twenty-first issue, we were busy preparing for the conference in October, and after the conference we were busy with the Bible study. By the time we finished the Bible study, I was quite exhausted. Therefore, the publication of the twenty-second issue was delayed until now. In order to meet the need of many readers, we have enlarged this issue. In the first section of this issue, we discuss the kind of attitude and experience we should have concerning the coming of the kingdom of Christ. In the last article, we emphasize the most important principle in our work.</P><P>Concerning the recent conference, which was our second, we have to confess that God blessed us. Nevertheless, we deeply feel that we did not fully obtain what we should have attained. Perhaps I should be responsible for this myself. As to the expense of this conference, although the amount was quite large, the offerings of the brothers and sisters locally and abroad have left us with even a few dollars over.</P><P>In our conferences our intention is only to speak forth the message of the victory of Christ, not to speak of other matters. The preaching of this message is our particular responsibility. If there had not been some outside brothers raising some questions, perhaps we would have seen more spiritual accomplishments in this conference. In reality, unless a person knows God in the aspects of trusting and obeying Him, it is of little use to speak to him concerning other matters. We can mention many other matters to those who are faithful, but if we share them with those who are yet unwilling to serve God faithfully, it will only give rise to disputes. It is our desire that anyone's commitment concerning issues of the church or issues of prophecy would result from a spiritual background acquired in the presence of God. We do not want any person to have an outward commitment in his stand concerning the church just because he has listened to our exhortation. Our Bible study meetings, on the other hand, are of a different nature: they are conducted for those who are willing to serve God faithfully and are seeking to have a clearer understanding of Bible truths. For this reason, we are free in these meetings to bring up those things which we would be reluctant to bring up in conferences. We hope that in our future conferences, neither the speaker nor the listeners will bring up, either publicly or privately, any matters outside the victory of Christ, in order that we might have God's full blessing. In other words, the content of our preaching in the October conference was the same as what we have preached all these years in The Present Testimony. I deeply believe that those who have been taught in the presence of God know that The Present Testimony preaches a special message. Just as we have not mentioned other matters in The Present Testimony, we have tried to avoid these same matters in our past as well as future conferences. This does not mean that other matters are not important; but it does mean that when men sincerely desire to receive the victory of Christ and to believe and obey the Lord, He will spontaneously direct their attention to these other external matters, and they will automatically obey. There will not be the need for much exhortation from others, and there will not be many disputes. At this stage, if certain things are not clear to some, we would be most willing to help them in the Bible study meetings. We deeply sense that what the church of God urgently needs and what she absolutely must experience today is the victory of Christ-the facts and principles which He declared through His death and resurrection. In this matter we need to be faithful and steadfast, and we need to preach it wholeheartedly. May the Lord bless every one of my dear readers!</P><P>A household slave of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee<br>December 1931</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PATTERN IN THE MOUNTAIN</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 22</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Heb. 8:5; Psa. 19:13</H1><P>In spiritual work, the most important thing is to know the "pattern...in the mountain" (Heb. 8:5). There are many things that are important in spiritual work; the lack of any one of them causes our work to lose its spiritual usefulness and brings about God's displeasure. But among these many things, the most important one is the "pattern...in the mountain." The pattern in the mountain is simply God's plan. If there is no comprehension of God's plan, there is no possibility for God's work.</P><P>Hebrews tells us that the tabernacle was made according to the pattern of God. Before Moses could make the tabernacle, he stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights so that God could show him the pattern of the tabernacle in heaven. From the Holy Place to the altar, including every layer of covering on the tabernacle, there was a definite pattern for the material and color to be used. Nothing was laid out arbitrarily. Everything was definitely specified. The Bible spells them out in a clear manner. Everything concerning the altar, laver, table, lampstand, incense altar, ark, and the rest of the items in the tabernacle, including the kinds of metal or wood to be used, their measurement and color, were specified according to God's predetermined pattern. There was not one item according to Moses' intention.</P><P>Just as He made the tabernacle, God also has a predetermined plan regarding His present work of building the church. Everything must be done in a definite way, whether it is great or small. Moses did not bear the responsibility of drafting the pattern of the tabernacle. He was only responsible for building according to the pattern shown to him on the mountain. The glory of a worker of Christ does not depend on whether he can do something for God based on his own innovative idea, but on whether he is able to carry out God's revealed will. The comprehension of God's predetermined plan is the glory of God's worker.</P><P>When I began to work, a Western missionary (who has since passed away) told me that God's work allows absolutely no liberty. When Moses was building the tabernacle, he had no freedom to decide whether a small nail should be gold or silver; everything had to be done according to God's instructions.</P><P>God called Moses the meekest person on the earth. Meekness means being "very supple and yielding." Whatever God wanted Moses to do, he did. Whatever material and color God wanted Moses to use, whatever the pattern and measurements, all had to be according to God's instructions. In every matter he acted according to God's direction and never according to his own intention. This is meekness.</P><P>Here is something that affords us a great deal of spiritual insight. We can see the position of a servant with regard to the Lord's work. Everything concerning the tabernacle was determined by God Himself. He did not let Moses decide one thing. He did not give Moses the opportunity to contribute any idea. God not only told Moses the general scheme for building the tabernacle, He also told him the details. Not only were the pattern, material, and color according to God's instructions, but the measurement of every item was also determined by Him. It was not sufficient just to work with the materials chosen by God; there was also a definite charge concerning how to handle the material. For instance, the curtains should not just be made of fine linen, but of fine twined linen. The Bible tells us further that the lampstand should not just be pure gold, but one piece of pure beaten gold. God did not leave any room for Moses to provide an idea. God knew what He wanted for Himself; He did not need man to tell Him what His wishes were.</P><P>The greatest blessing of a worker of Christ is being able to receive God's instructions on the mountain and to know the work that God has entrusted to him with its pre-determined pattern. In all that we see today, can we say that the servants of Christ have come before God to ask Him to assign them the work that they should do? Do they come before God and ask Him to direct them concerning the time and the way of their work? Is it not true that we see many meetings, discussions, plannings, deliberations, and decisions? Many assume that God does not have a detailed arrangement regarding their work and that many matters are their responsibility. They have not seen that in God's work they are merely servants and should only do what they are told. "Whatever He says to you, do" (John 2:5b). In the Body of Christ, we are just members; we have to be absolutely under the control of the Head. "Holding the Head" (Col. 2:19). These people assume that God will use their natural life and natural ability to make up what is lacking in God's plan. We are not saying this for the purpose of criticizing. Rather, we desire that God's children see that in God's work, Christ is an absolute master. Everything concerning the work must be first received as an order from Him before it can be carried out. The manifestation of the ability of a worker of Christ and the demonstration of an abundance of spiritual usefulness can only happen when one attentively listens to God's plan and, accordingly, carries it out. Other works may be thriving and may look great in men's eyes, but they do not have real power or usefulness.</P><P>Psalm 19:13 says, "Keep Your servant from presumptuous sins; / Do not let them have dominion over me; / Then I will be blameless and cleared / Of great transgression." Our sins toward God are of two kinds: one is rebellion and the other is presumption. When God tells you to do something, and contrary to His wishes, you do not obey but do what He does not want, that is a sin of rebellion. We all know that this is a sin and are willing to make an effort to terminate it. None of us want to commit this sin. But, brothers and sisters, please remember that the Bible not only tells us that rebellion is a sin, but that presumption and rashness are also sins. When we begin a work that God has not instructed us to do, we are committing a sin of presumption. Rebellion is refusing to do what God has commanded, and presumption is doing what God has not commanded. Acting outside of God is the sin of presumption. He says, "Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal" (Exo. 20:14-15). If a man commits these, it is sin. We all know this. But in things which He has not commanded, we assume that we can act carelessly, without realizing that this is also a sin. If we begin anything that He has not commanded, even the very best thing, it is also a sin. When He has not given us the command, even working for God is a sin. The prayer in Psalms is really good. The psalmist asked God to keep him from presumptuous sins.</P><P>God knows what He wants. All the things that He wants from us are revealed either through the Bible or through the Holy Spirit. Therefore, whatever He has not said is simply work He does not want. In spiritual work it is not a matter of quantity, but a matter of measuring up to the standard of being useful to God and matching His desire. The most important task for a worker of Christ is to know exactly what God wants him to do and the time and method that he should use to carry it out. There is no need for a worker of Christ to consider what he ought to do, nor is there the place for words such as, "I imagine that this would please the Lord." It is a wonderful thing in the New Testament that a man can know God's will. A worker of Christ can receive, within him, the revelation of the Holy Spirit and clearly know God's requirement of him. This knowledge is real. It is not his own idea or the encouragement and instruction from others. Neither is it just the teaching of the Bible in letter. Rather, it is the clear seeing of God's command in his spirit, in the deepest part of his being. Today those who understand spiritual revelations have declined in number. There are few who can say, "I have clearly seen." Consequently, "God's work" is no longer a work that God wants to accomplish. Rather, it becomes something which man regards as good and spiritual, which man earnestly strives for and counts as beneficial. It becomes something which replaces God's work.</P><P>What we see today is that there are more volunteers than those who are called. Many can only say, "I have come," but not, "I have been sent." Therefore, we see that God's work is overcast with spiritual death. There are many works which God has not asked for but which have come about because man initiated an enthusiasm for God. Under the assumption that God needs these works, they proceed to perform them and call them the work of God. Actually, in this kind of work the portion that is from God and of God is almost nil.</P><P>It is God, not us, who determines that any spiritual work is necessary. The most that we can do is express His desire. Actually, every work that has any spiritual value is initiated from God's heart. We are merely those who, by the revelation of the Holy Spirit within us, are granted the understanding to work. Presently, regardless of their outward appearance, there are only two kinds of work, commission and results. One is initiated by God and the other by man. In the former, God wants it so; in the latter, man thinks that this is what God wants. My dear brothers, what kind of work are you doing?</P><P>It is most regrettable that the workers of Christ either have not paid attention to the sin of presumption or have not thoroughly understood the sin of presumption. Before God they have not been brought by the Holy Spirit to the point where they thoroughly judge themselves and realize that only God is the Lord and that they have entirely no leeway to propose any idea. We need the reproving of the Holy Spirit so that we realize what is sin, what is presumption, and how detestable they are. We ought to know that it is not only a sin for us to ignore His command, but it is also a sin when we do what He has not commanded. Many often say, "Why can I not do this, since God has not forbidden it?" Instead, we should say, "How can I do this, since God has not commanded it?" Any person who is not deep and spiritual in the Lord assumes that we can do anything that the Bible has not forbidden. But those who are deeper and more spiritual know that if they do many things which the Bible has not forbidden, but which God has also not commanded, they are committing a presumptuous sin. Brothers and sisters, I have a deep realization that, if God eventually brings you to a deeper stage, you will not only realize that you must not rebel against Him, and that you must refrain from things which He has forbidden, but that you must also stop doing those things which He has neither commanded nor forbidden. If, by your own will, you can refrain from doing the things which God has not commanded, you will be a mature man, a man whom God can use. A mature man does not act if God has not commanded; he does not commit presumptuous sins. If God has not commanded him, he will just be quiet and still. God will use only this kind of person.</P><P>Today in God's work, we see that man almost always acts according to his own desire. If a person does not inquire concerning what is God's will, God's time, and God's way, then, even if his work is the best work, it is merely done according to the enthusiasm of his soulish life. Many of God's children do not realize that the flesh not only resists God, but it also attempts to help God. They do not realize that even our natural, soulish life has some merit. They do not realize that their soulish life has initiated their zeal for God. Thus, the soulish life will consider ways to make the church of God prosperous, calculate ways to expand God's kingdom, or strive in many ways to save sinners. Their motives and intentions are good, but they do not realize that the natural life is driving them, making them so zealous, calculating, planning, maneuvering, and endeavoring. They do not realize the preciousness of being under God's command alone. They assume that as long as it is "God's work," then it is the best work. They do not realize that God has no pleasure in anything that comes from the natural life, no matter how good its motive, how noble its goal, and how impressive its result. God takes no pleasure because it does not originate from His will, and, therefore, is not fitted for His use. They also do not realize that God does not supply His power for any work which does not come out of His will. On the contrary, they assume that their zeal, tone, emotion, strength, and tears for the work are the result of God's strengthening power. Little do they realize that at such times they are actually drawing on the power of their natural life to supply the work of their natural life.</P><P>What is the cause of presumption? It is nothing other than a manifestation of the natural life. Although many go along when God gives commands, they do not sincerely delight in God's will. In their hearts they still prefer their own ideas. Therefore, when God is silent and does not speak, they proceed to act presumptuously. If we do not judge the flesh and take up the cross to deal with our self, we may reluctantly obey when God gives a command; but, when God gives no command, we will act unavoidably according to our own ideas.</P><P>With respect to God's work, being presumptuous does not necessarily mean that one has a wrong intention. Before we are captured by God, our self life does not delight in serving God. But after we are captured by God, we desire to serve God. This is the most dangerous moment. In the past we were absolutely not serving God; now we intend to serve God and want to serve according to our own way. God demands that we do not merely serve Him, but that we serve Him according to the way of His delight. We make a mistake in thinking that all He demands is our service and that the way to serve can be left to our own design. We fail to realize that any service not done according to God's command and will is not acceptable to Him. Not only is our work ordained by God, but the matters concerning the process, method, and time of the work are also ordained by Him.</P><P>No matter how good a motive may be, it cannot replace God's will. No matter how much success a work produces, it is far inferior to God's delight. Many works are done "to meet the need of the circumstances," "to help the believers in their spiritual life," and "to save the souls of sinners"; they are not done for the purpose of obeying God's command. We cannot say that there is definitely no result from this kind of work, but this kind of worker and work are not suitable for God's use. We should not be concerned about the outward need of sinners and believers, but for God's need at this hour. We are here for God's need, not for the sinners' needs or the saints' needs. We are God's servants. Although God has entrusted us with the responsibility of the work, He has reserved for Himself the authority to command the workers. Although the Holy Spirit called Paul and Barnabas to work, they could not go to Asia according to their own wish. The authority to administrate the movement of the workers rests forever in the hands of the Holy Spirit. It is not that Asia did not have a need, but at that time God did not have a need for Asia. Acts shows in a wonderful way that the Holy Spirit gives us the power to work and that the Holy Spirit also commands the direction of our work. Supplying God's need at this time is the responsibility of our work.</P><P>The Bible shows us that God has not put His work into our hands. God has only servants, not managers. We are not hired by God; we are purchased by Him. He requires that we be servants. The word servant is slave according to the Greek. A slave is not a hireling; he is bought with money. A hireling will serve his master if the master's disposition is good, but if not, he can resign. This is what some people refer to as "staying if in agreement and leaving if in discord." But if we are slaves, we have to serve. Even if we do not like it, we still have to serve. We are God's slaves, not His workers, and even less, His managers. Therefore, we cannot do anything according to our own wishes. God has not committed matters to us so that we may propose ideas according to what we perceive to be good or bad. God does not work in this way. For everything, God has a definite command for us to follow. If we have not received a command from Him but work presumptuously, He cannot accept us and cannot use us; consequently, our work will certainly be burned.</P><P>The Bible shows us that God manifests His work not only in great things, He manifests it also in small matters. For this reason, we should let Him occupy not only the first place but also the last place. We should honor Him not only as the Lord of great things, but also as the Lord of small things. He is through all and fills all. If we have done something that is not according to God's will, we may still receive praise from men and still consider that we have done an excellent work, but God will have no use for us.</P><P>The Bible shows us many examples. Leviticus 10:1-2 says, "Now the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, each took his censer and put fire in it, and placed incense upon it, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them. And fire came from before Jehovah and consumed them, and they died before Jehovah." The ordinances concerning offerings stipulate that every time incense is burned, one must use the fire on the altar to ignite it. Nadab and Abihu's failure was due to the fact that they used some other fire to burn the incense, rather than using the fire on the altar. The consequence was death before God.</P><P>The altar is a type of the cross. The incense is our service before God. The zeal of our service must come from the altar of the cross. Those who do not follow the ordinances concerning offering must die. What is the cross? It is the place where we put the self to death and let the Lord live. "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20). The wisdom of the self, the opinion of the self, the ability, enthusiasm, expectation, and longings of the self and natural life are all dealt with in this verse. After passing through the dealing of the cross, we are worthy to come to serve before God.</P><P>We do not know how much of man's zeal is strange fire! It has not gone through the dealing of the cross and is not severed from man's desires and cleverness. Their zeal is completely according to the desires of the flesh, and man supposes that if he does this or that and the work prospers, then God must be pleased. The zeal may indeed be a form of zeal, but it does not originate from God. The fire may be genuine fire, yet it is not the fire on the altar. Rather, it is strange fire. Whatever does not come from the altar of crucifixion and from self-forsaking is altogether strange fire. Strange fire is nothing but the fire of the self, the fire that issues from the soulish life. This is the fire of the fleshly and natural life. It is nothing other than the natural life interfering with God's affairs. Although the matter is from God, the natural life proposes how it should be done. The self insists on its proposal, method, and wisdom in God's affairs. Even though the strange fire is fire, God will not accept the incense of our service. On the contrary, we will die before Him.</P><P>Nadab and Abihu were sons of Aaron. Aaron was the high priest chosen by God. What these two men did was not rebellion and resistance against God. They were burning incense to serve God and please God. But they did something that God had not commanded, something that God had not ordained; therefore, they received God's judgment. The sons of Aaron assumed that since God had not forbidden the use of other fire to burn the incense, that strange fire would surely be all right. They did not realize that, in the matter of serving God, we should not do something that God has not specifically commanded. They did not realize how strict God is. In God's work whatever He has not commanded, He forbids. If men do it, they commit a mistake and sin. Because these two committed such a presumptuous sin, God slew them. Although they were the sons of Aaron and were priests waiting on God, He could not forgive them.</P><P>What they did was not cheating, law-breaking, fornication, or robbery, as was the case with the sons of Eli. They did not rebel against an obvious command from God to intentionally commit what God had forbidden. Rather, they purposely intended to serve God and please Him. They purposely and personally prepared two censers and used the fire they brought to light the incense, assuming that they would gain God's favor in this way. Little did they realize that, even though their intention was good, they were following their own idea in coming before God to serve Him. They did what God had not commanded. Little did they know that doing something beyond God's will is sin and offends God. In every matter concerning God's service, God does not consider something good merely because our intention is good. Our intention may be good, but if we act presumptuously, God will still punish us for the presumptuous sin. We may not see much severity in God's dealing with us in our work today. But the numerous works that come out of strange fire will be consumed before the judgment seat. May God open our eyes to realize what is sin. Not only are fornication, robbery, deceitfulness, extortion, unrighteousness, and filthiness sins, even "doing God's work," "preaching to save souls," "rendering help to others," and "leading others," are also sins if they are not done according to God's command. God will judge these sins just as He will judge the sins of unrighteousness and filthiness. Whatever you do apart from God's command is a service of strange fire.</P><P>The record in 1 Samuel 13:8-14 concerning Saul's offer of the burnt offering should be a great warning to us. There were three reasons why Saul made the offering. First, he saw the people scattering away from him. Second, Samuel did not come at the appointed time. Third, his enemies, the Philistines, had pitched in Michmash and gone down to Gilgal to fight against him. Therefore, he took it upon himself to offer the burnt offering. Saul did not commit a sin of fornication, robbery, or extortion. He was just making an offering to Jehovah. In his heart he was afraid God would not be pleased if he did not make supplication. So he thought if he made more supplication, God would certainly accept him. He assumed that if he could do a little more service to Jehovah, he would be able to deliver the people out of the hands of the enemies. He did not realize that this was not the case. Samuel said to Saul, "Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee" (1 Sam. 13:13-14).</P><P>"Therefore said I" was not God's command (v. 12). God wants us to serve Him according to His instructions. He does not want us to work according to "I thought" and "I assume." Everything that is done according to what one thinks or assumes is altogether rejected by God. What God wants is that man would be after His heart's desire. What God stresses is not what we have done, but what we have made subject to Him. Obeying is better than offering burnt offerings, and hearkening is better than the fat of rams.</P><P>We are oftentimes like Saul. We rush into many things. We believe that God would not delay, so we do not wait for God's time. We only see our need and the need of the circumstance; we forget to wait for God's time and rush into things which God has not commanded us to do.</P><P>Brothers, Saul lost his throne because he was too enthusiastic, too hasty to supplicate, and too eager to sacrifice. But how justifiable were his reasons for doing this! Yet God said, "I would seek a man after My own heart and anoint him to be king." God does not want a man who can barely wait or who can labor in many works. God does not want outstanding people or fruitful people who can save and revive many. Rather, He wants some who are after His heart. If it were up to us, we would surely prefer a person like Saul because he was an outstanding man. When Saul was anointed king and stood among the people, "he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward" (1 Sam. 10:23). We only care for the outward appearance of man, while God does not want a man with an attractive face, but one who seeks after His heart. May our goal never be great performances that please others and ourselves, but rather be touching God's heart and pleasing Him. Only this kind of person can be used by God. God is seeking after this very kind of person.</P><P>Let us go on to read 2 Samuel 6:1-4 and 6:6b-7. "Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims. And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah...accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark...Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God." When many people come to this point, they ask, "What is the reason for this? Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it. This should be to his credit. He did not do anything bad." But God immediately smote him. We have to know that a principle in the Old Testament is that God's glory depends on the ark. If the ark, God's glory, falters, and you step forth to uphold it, is this not a very good thing? But God wants man to obey His instructions more than He wants him to help in His work. God does not need man to uphold His glory. If a man touches the ark, God will slay him. The question is not the seriousness of the consequence of the ark's fall, but whether God has commanded you to do something related to its fall. You may think that when everything is peaceful and trouble-free, you should naturally not touch the ark for fear of danger to your life. However, when the ark is at a critical point of failing, you assume that it is your duty to touch and uphold it, lest it fall. You assume that you have a way to comply with the necessities of circumstances and, therefore, will not die. But with God, one rule applies to all; there is no room for change according to circumstances. Whoever does anything without God's command will incur either physical death or spiritual death.</P><P>God does not ask whether we have done a good or a bad job. Neither does He ask whether or not we are helping Him. He said that man's hands should not touch the ark. Therefore, whoever touches it will surely die. God would rather let the ark fall into pieces than to let men help Him without His command. Too often we identify various needs, and we begin to help God. But we should never do what Uzzah did; our hands should never reach forth. We should never step forth to help just because the circumstances beckon our help. God's command is the only thing that we should pay attention to. Those who want to comply with the necessities of the circumstances for the purpose of rescuing a situation due to its urgency, without waiting for God's command, never please God in His work. The work can be left temporarily, outwardly in failure, but God's sovereignty cannot be set aside for a moment, and man's flesh must not be unbridled at any time. God does not need the flesh to uphold and help His work. Rather, He has to judge all activities of the flesh.</P><P>Many people want to do things which God has not given them; they have a craving for many things. They insist on pleasing God according to their own ideas. What God has not commanded them to do, they, on the contrary, do with all their might. Little do they know that by so doing, they do not please God, and they also commit a sin in God's eyes. When we were unbelievers, we all conducted our lives according to our wisdom and did many things which were against God's nature. Once we are saved, we think that we can use our wisdom to serve and help God according to our perception of what is good. Little do we realize that, just as it was a sin to oppose God with our wisdom when we were unbelievers, it is also a sin to help God in His work with our wisdom after we are saved. God does not need our wisdom to help Him. God is not pleased when man uses his wisdom to oppose Him; neither is He pleased when man uses his wisdom to help Him. God does not need man to help His work. We must take the principle of the cross and reject all activities of the self life. We must be willing to put the flesh to death and be ready to forsake our own ideas. Whenever we assume that by doing this or that, we will prosper God's work, we prove to others that we have never forsaken the self and have never known the cross. Man must be brought to a position of nothingness before God can use him.</P><P>May we not act presumptuously so that we damage God's work. We should pay attention only to God's command and to nothing else besides. Even if the work collapses before our eyes, we should pay no attention to the collapse; rather, we should persist in our affairs and maintain our position before God. God will not hold us responsible for what He has not commanded. Although everything may collapse around us, God still will not reprove us.</P><P>Actually, every presumptuous act arises from the fact that man's wisdom has not yet passed through the dealing of the cross. Today God requires that we would lay hold of this matter: whatever God has instructed, we should do; whatever God has not instructed, we should not do. We have to hold on to our position and should not go beyond our duties to meddle in the affairs of others.</P><P>Perhaps some consider this way to be too narrow, that if a man takes this way, his work will become too quiet and ordinary. However, "that day" will show whether this was the right way or not. You will know then whether any work outside of God's will was good or worthwhile. Let me put it in a blunt way: if the way of undisciplined self-appointment were applied in our human employment, we would definitely be suspended. If we were in an army, we would certainly be court-martialed. It is fortunate that we have the overshadowing of the Lord's blood and are spared from the Lord's severe dealing. But at the judgment seat this kind of work will be shown to be cause for reproach.</P><P>Please read 2 Chronicles 26:16-21, in which a king wanted to do things according to his own intention. God's command said that only the sons of Aaron could carry out the holy service and priesthood; only they were allowed to enter the temple to burn incense. Besides this class of people, no one else could perform this work. But Uzziah insisted on doing this work. He went into the temple himself to burn incense. Consequently, God punished him, and immediately leprosy rose up on his forehead. This account affords us a great warning. We should never do anything on our own initiative that God has not commanded, lest we be punished by God. Spiritually speaking, leprosy is filthiness and sinfulness. All those who presumptuously act without God's command are filthy and sinful before God. In God's work, there is no room for natural enthusiasm. Man cannot apply natural enthusiasm in God's work. Entering the temple and burning incense is good, but because Uzziah did something that God had not commanded, it became a punishable sin. The consequence of participating capriciously in God's work was a lifetime of leprosy.</P><P>Paul was an apostle with a very deep spiritual life. In his second epistle to the Corinthians he said, "But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you...but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance" (10:13, 15b). This word, though ordinary, is spoken from much experience. Paul said that he would not reach for a place beyond what God had measured to him. Paul would not go to any place that God had not measured to him. He recognized that it was his responsibility to go only to the places that God wanted him to be responsible for. He would not go to any place that God had not asked him to be responsible for. Today if every worker would be this way, how could there be any of the numerous divisions and sects in the church! Every worker has a specific work which God measures to him. Every believer has a pathway upon which God wants him to walk. If you are standing in your rightful position, working in your rightful service, and walking on your rightful pathway, that is the highest glory.</P><P>We work, not because we reckon that the work is good or that it can save and help people. Rather, we evaluate our work by considering whether or not our position is one that is ordained by God. A big pillar in a house is crucial, but a little iron nail is nevertheless indispensable. In the church, if everybody is a great revivalist, evangelist, and leader, how can the church have a healthy standing? The way we ought to take is a narrow way according to God's will. We do not plan to accomplish great things. We just stay in the position arranged by God. If God wants me to work quietly on small matters only, I am willing to do so. God does not need to use those with great talent; He uses those who let Him use them. May we be willing to remain in the position God ordains for us and stand where he wants us to stand. All desire for change, high hope, and great ambition is worldly, soulish, and fleshly. We must guard ourselves against all these.</P><P>Paul said, "That I may finish my course" (Acts 20:24). What is this course? A few months ago I read a biography of Mrs. Penn-Lewis. (The first chapter of this biography was written by her. She passed away before the whole book was finished.) She said the following words, </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>There is a "course" prepared for every believer at the time of his regeneration for the purpose of bringing the new life he has just received to its full maturity, and for the purpose of making his life useful to God to the uttermost. The responsibility of every believer is to seek out this "course" and walk therein. Others cannot determine and say what this course is. Only God knows and only God can make man know; only He can lead the believers into this course. Today [the situation] is the same as in the past when He led Jeremiah and the other prophets, and Paul, Philip, and other apostles.</P><P>The most glorious thing in a man's life is that he would do the things that God wants him to do on the very ground that God has set for him. For every believer, there is a pathway predetermined by God for him to walk on.</P><P>God only uses men chosen by Him to do His work. He does not want those who enlist and volunteer to do His work. Those who are chosen by God have absolutely no freedom. If they try to be free and go their own way, they will only stumble and suffer more. If God never uses you, that is the end of the matter. But if He does, even if you want to run away, you will not succeed. You can flee to Tarshish, but a wind will turn you over into the sea and a great fish will bring you back (Jonah 1-2). You may run away, but you will never escape. God's workers have no freedom from the beginning to the end. Today many believers zealously work, but there are few who do what God measures to them and take the way that God ordains for them.</P><P>When Moses was leading the people of Israel through the wilderness, God instructed that no work should be done on the Sabbath day. But some reported to Moses that they found a man gathering sticks outside the camp on the Sabbath day. Moses did not make any decision on his own concerning this man. He seemingly said, "God has not declared anything and I do not know how to handle this matter. Let me go to inquire of Jehovah." Later he went to ask God, and God told him to stone to death the man who trespassed against the Sabbath day. So they stoned him to death (Num. 15:32-36). Moses waited for God to instruct him on what to do before he dared to do anything.</P><P>If we are not willing to wait a little, God's work will suffer a great loss! How hasty is our disposition. We always consider that God is too slow. We cannot patiently follow God step by step. Anything we perceive as good we hastily do. Wherever we detect a lack, we immediately try to supplement it. We assume that if we wait for everything, we will not be able to do anything in our whole lifetime. We forget that the workers who are blessed are those who can wait before God and obey His instructions.</P><P>Today we bear a heavy responsibility; we must be crystal clear about God's instructions before we start working. Before we receive God's command, we must do absolutely nothing. God's command is an expression of God's desire. If we want to be a useful vessel in His hands, we must secure God's command before acting. If we do anything which God has not commanded, we cannot please Him. When a certain work is put before us, we must first ask: Will this go along with God's desire? Can it gain His heart? May we seek to be compatible only with God's desire. We should engage ourselves in a spiritual work because we seek after God's desire, not because it is a good work or because the circumstance needs our help. If we desire to be useful in God's hands, we must walk according to God's will.</P><P>The pattern in the mountain cannot be changed at will; we must work according to that pattern. Are we going to say that this is our work and that we need not go by God's will? Or are we going to say that this is God's work and that we will go by His will? All things considered, we cannot but lament that God's work has been ruined in man's hands!</P><P>I will frankly say that if our wisdom has never passed through judgment and our thoughts have not been put to death, we cannot work. May God bring us to a stage where there is no self, so that we will have no thought of our own, but will only have God's will. Every time we work, we must first know if it is God's will or not. If we know for certain that this is God's will, then we should be encouraged to proceed according to the pattern He has shown us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 23</H2><P>This issue of The Present Testimony is the first of this year. There are many reasons for the delay of the publication of this issue, but we praise God who has made it possible for us to now complete it.</P><P>When we looked at God's provision for The Present Testimony during the last year, we could not help but praise God. Year after year, the number of copies printed has increased (we are now printing five thousand copies of each issue), and the expenses have increased also. However, God has provided all our needs. He is worthy of our trust. The offerings of God's faithful stewards to Him, though small at times, has been a genuine touch of their love. Praise God!</P><P>Some people have asked whether the content of The Present Testimony can be simplified so that it can reach the ordinary believers. Some have asked whether The Present Testimony can mention other particular truths. Some people have even mailed us some very good articles and asked if these can be published in The Present Testimony. For these reasons, I realize that God wants me to clarify the nature of The Present Testimony once again.</P><P>I think that the readers who have been reading this magazine for several years will feel that the messages delivered in The Present Testimony are substantially different from other magazines. It is even different from Notes on Scriptural Messages which is a magazine published by us for young believers. The reason for this difference is that The Present Testimony has a specific goal, a specific nature, and a specific direction. We feel deeply that there is a great deal of literature that is very helpful to people, and we have no intention of discrediting their merits. But God's church is lacking a special kind of magazine that emphasizes only spiritual principles, that does not mention anything but "Principles of Spiritual Life," so that it may provide a little light to those who are genuinely seeking progress in the spiritual pathway. We also have special conferences each year for this purpose. We admit that The Present Testimony is not for all believers; it is for those believers who have a need. If The Present Testimony falls into someone's hands who does not have a need or who does not feel a need, it will not mean much to him. If, however, The Present Testimony falls into someone's hands who happens to have a need, he will feel that he has found his food. The purpose of The Present Testimony is to meet a need; therefore, it will only help those who have the need. Many people have told us that at first they did not think too much of it, but after a period of time when God began to deal with them, they realized that The Present Testimony had its special usefulness.</P><P>We have paid careful attention to this special nature ever since we published the old edition of The Present Testimony in 1923. We have even paid more specific attention to this point since we started the new edition of The Present Testimony in 1928. This is God's commission to us, and we hope in the future that we can be faithful to this commission and not change for any reason. May God open our eyes to see that some truths are different from other truths. Praise God that more than a few people have already seen this difference. Peace be with you all!</P><P>A household slave of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee<br>May 1932</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FOUR CRUCIAL JOURNEYS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 23</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 2:1-14</H1><P>In this passage of the Scriptures there are four journeys. These include setting out from Gilgal, the journey to Bethel, the journey to Jericho, and the crossing of the Jordan River. Before Elijah was taken into heaven and Elisha received a double portion of the Holy Spirit, they passed through these four places. If we want to be like Elijah, who was taken into heaven, or like Elisha, who received the outer clothing of the Holy Spirit (that is, the Holy Spirit descending upon him like an outer garment), the crucial lesson is that we must travel on these four journeys. Whether we are raptured or receive the power of the Holy Spirit, we all must set out from Gilgal and journey until we cross the Jordan. Now we want to see the significance of the names of these four places.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. GILGAL-THE FLESH<br>(VERSE 1)</H2><P>The interpretation of every name must be based on its first mention in the Bible. If we read Joshua 5:9, we see that Gilgal means "to roll away." Verses 2 through 9 of this chapter tell us that the generation of Israelites who came out of Egypt were circumcised; however, those of the second generation, who were born in the wilderness, were not. At that point, they were about to enter Canaan and to receive the inheritance; they needed to have the old flesh and shame of Egypt rolled away so that they could begin a new living. Therefore, the meaning of circumcision is to put off the body of the flesh (Col. 2:11).</P><P>Is there anyone who knows what the flesh is? Is there anyone who knows what dealing with the flesh and judging the flesh are? Many people think that once they overcome sin, they are perfect. Little do they realize that the flesh still exists out from which comes sin! In the Bible the flesh is condemned by God and is very displeasing to God. The flesh is everything we possess from our birth. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" (John 3:6). All that we possess from our birth is of the flesh. In the flesh there is not only sin, uncleanness, and corruption, but also natural kindness, talent, zeal, wisdom, and ability. The most difficult lesson for a believer to learn in his life is recognizing his flesh. God must bring him through every kind of failure and exposure before he will know the flesh.</P><P>In the spiritual journey and work of a believer, the thing that hinders him the most is his flesh. He does not know that God's calling involves giving up his entire flesh. He considers that it is sufficient just to do away with sin. Little does he realize that his ability, zeal, wisdom in God's work, goodness, and capability in spiritual life are all displeasing to God. In God's eyes, what we consider to be good according to the flesh, including what we plan and ingeniously orchestrate, should all be rejected, put to death, and taken through judgment. God does not need man's flesh to help Him, either in his spiritual life or in his work.</P><P>Gilgal is the place where the flesh is judged and the place where God gives us the light to judge the flesh. God says the flesh must be put off; we must, therefore, agree with Him. When God says it must be cut off, we have to cut it off. We must start from Gilgal, and we must reject the flesh. It is not a matter of how much cutting should be done, but a matter of judging the flesh. The present error is that men pay attention to being zealous, doing good, and working, while forgetting to reject their flesh. But it is very important to judge the flesh the way God judges it. According to what I have learned before God, regeneration, sanctification, perfection, the overcoming of sin, and the acquisition of power are not the highest expressions of spiritual life. Rejecting the flesh is the proper spiritual path and goal of spiritual living. All those who have not set out from Gilgal have not started on the spiritual pathway. All those who have not learned to reject the flesh do not truly know the spiritual life. They can be zealous, work, and rejoice, but they do not truly know the spiritual life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BETHEL-THE WORLD<br>(VERSES 2 THROUGH 3)</H2><P>We now come to Bethel. What is the meaning of Bethel? We have to read the portion in the Bible which first mentions Bethel to determine its meaning. Please read Genesis 12:8. Bethel is the place where Abram built an altar. The altar is a place of fellowship and communication with God. It is the place where we consecrate ourselves to God, the place where we are totally given to Him.</P><P>Genesis 12:9-14 records Abram's going down to Egypt. There was no altar in Egypt! His fellowship with God was discontinued and his heart of consecration to God was lost. This is the difference between Bethel and Egypt. Bethel and Egypt are opposites. What then is the meaning of Bethel? Bethel means the opposite of Egypt.</P><P>The record in Genesis 13:3-4 is very meaningful. "And he [Abram] went on his journeys from the south [Egypt was in the south] even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord." Abram did not have any fellowship with God in Egypt. Later, he returned to his original place, Bethel, and called on the name of the Lord. Only at Bethel will a person have fellowship with God and only there will he consecrate himself to God.</P><P>While Gilgal refers to the victory over the flesh, Bethel refers to the victory over the world, because Egypt signifies the world. Victory over the world is a condition for being raptured and receiving the power of the Holy Spirit. Our living should be such that the world cannot touch our heart. Are we separated from the world? Does our manner of life indicate that we are a people who are separated from the world? Does our attitude and conversation indicate that we no longer belong to this world? What about our intentions? Do we still have a little secret craving for all the things in the world? Do we secretly delight in men's praise? Do we secretly avoid men's slandering? Whenever we experience some gain or loss, does it touch our feelings? How much difference is there between our feeling toward the world and the feelings that others have toward the world?</P><P>If our heart has not completely overcome the world and the people, affairs, and things of this world, and if these things have not lost their place in our heart, we will not be able to arrive at the goal before us. If a believer truly desires to be filled with the Holy Spirit and be raptured, he must pay the price to take the way of the Lord, which is to journey to a place where the Lord can give him His Spirit. We must forsake the world and learn to fellowship with God on the altar of total consecration. This kind of consecration and fellowship is indispensable.</P><P>There was no famine in Egypt. Even if there had been one, there was the relief of the old grain that had been stored. But in the land of Canaan, there were frequent famines. This tells us that there is no famine in the world. But, on the pathway of obedience to God, there are unavoidable times of famine. In the world there are no trials; but the pathway of obedience to God is full of trials. This is the road that must be traveled in order to be raptured and receive power. Nevertheless, no matter how great the trials, there always is a way out with God. We should be faithful, and we should be watchful. If we are not watchful, we will find ourselves in Egypt with one fall! In Egypt there is no consecration and no drawing near to God. Living temporarily in Egypt is sinning temporarily. Living permanently in Egypt is even more pitiful. Even though we can avoid trials in Egypt, there is no altar there.</P><P>Some are like Abraham, who did not immediately go down to Egypt, but first went to the land of the south. Their direction is toward Egypt, but they have not yet reached Egypt. This way of living in the land of the south is half with the world and half with God. However, in the land of the south, there is no altar and no fellowship. Bethel signifies a place absolutely separated. It is not the worldly Egypt, nor is it the land of the south, which is a place mixed up with the world.</P><P>There were two million people among the Israelites. In the exodus out of Egypt, God did not allow a single person to build an altar in Egypt. To serve God, they had to take a three-day journey from Egypt (Exo. 8:25-27). In Egypt they could have the Passover because God delivered them out of the punishment of sin, which is death. However, they had to leave Egypt to come under the Lord's name and worship Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. JERICHO-SATAN<br>(VERSE 4)</H2><P>The passage which most clearly speaks of Jericho is in Joshua. In it we see an entire account of the subduing of the city of Jericho.</P><P>Joshua 6:26 says, "And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho." Thus, the name of this city means cursed. This portion of history speaks of the Israelites' first victory over the enemies in Canaan. The Canaanites signify evil spirits, which are of the devil. They are the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies mentioned in Ephesians 6:12. We struggle against them.</P><P>We have overcome the flesh and the world; now we still must overcome the enemy. The only way to overcome the enemy is to believe in God's Word, act according to His Word, and believe that we will receive the results of carrying out His Word. God has spoken, and it is sufficient. The men of Jericho said that they had a city; we say that we have God's Word. The men of Jericho said that their city was as tall as heaven; we say that our God is in heaven. The men of Jericho said that every place surrounded by their city belonged to them; we say that God has promised us every place that the soles of our feet will tread upon.</P><P>Many know only of the struggle between the spirit and the flesh; they are ignorant of the struggle between the believers and the evil spirits. This is what is spoken of in Ephesians 6. The real spiritual warfare is the warfare between us and Satan with his evil spirits. Every mature believer should join in this warfare. God's children on earth are often attacked by evil spirits. Some of these attacks are in the environment, some are in the physical body, mind, emotion, or spirit. At these end times, the evil spirits are particularly doubling their efforts to frustrate the believers from properly serving the Lord. In many matters, believers will experience great difficulties. They are not aware that they are being attacked by evil spirits. They do not know why everything is against them and everything is "messed up." They think that these things are just naturally that way and do not realize that they are being harassed by the evil spirits.</P><P>In these end times, it is crucial that the believers know their adversary and know how to struggle against him and overcome him. If we have overcome the flesh and the world without having overcome the work of the enemy, we will still not be able to go on.</P><P>It is not by power that Jericho fell, but by the Israelites' relying on God's Word and standing firm in their position. In order to overcome the attack of evil spirits, we first must disregard every situation and feeling and believe in God's Word of promise. This will defeat the enemy. Second, we must stand in the position that Christ has given us, which is in the heavens, and must put down Satan and his evil spirits to their inferior position.</P><P>Without God's Word and without exercising our faith to choose the position God has given, we cannot overcome the enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE RIVER JORDAN-DEATH<br>(VERSES 7 THROUGH 14)</H2><P>The Jordan signifies the power of death. Crossing the Jordan is overcoming death. This is to be raptured.</P><P>This is especially related to the Lord. The Lord was baptized in the river Jordan. The Lord's baptism signifies death, and coming out of the water signifies resurrection. By the power of resurrection, the Lord overcomes death. The greatest power of Satan is death. The Lord seems to have said to the enemy, "Try your best to do what you can to Me." Satan exhausted what he could do; but God resurrected Him. Satan wanted the Lord to die, but the Lord has a life which death cannot touch or hold down. The Lord passed through it on dry land!</P><P>There is no power other than the Lord's resurrection which can overcome death. We obtained this resurrection life at regeneration. The power of the resurrection life will wash away all death and everything that is of death.</P><P>There is a difference between crossing the Red Sea and crossing the river Jordan. The crossing of the Red Sea was forced upon the Israelites at that time. They had no alternative but to cross over because there were enemies pursuing. But crossing the river Jordan comes out of man's willingness and is man's own choice. There are some who will not cross the river Jordan. Many do not want the power of resurrection. Paul regarded the power of resurrection as important, and he pursued it (Phil. 3:10-12). Many people have already resurrected with the Lord, yet they still do not know the power of the Lord's resurrection. Therefore, they do not have the experience of overcoming death.</P><P>At this hour when the rapture is imminent, the last enemy that believers should overcome is death. Whether it is the death of the body, the death of the mind, or the death of the spiritual life, everything should be overcome. The present world is truly filled with the atmosphere of death. On the one hand, many who are used by the Lord often experience weakness and sickness in the body. On the other hand, the mental ability of many seems to have grown so numb that their thoughts, memory, and concentration are not as focused as before. Moreover, many seem to have their spirit surrounded by death. They are not lively but, rather, are powerless and impotent. They seem to be paralyzed and unable to control or deal with the demand of the circumstances upon their spirit. While preparing to be raptured, the believers must learn how to cross the Jordan and overcome death. They must learn to resist the power of death that exists in them and in their environment and must manifest the power of resurrection in all things. We should prove more and more that our Lord is resurrected. At the same time, we should demonstrate that we are joined to Him and have also been resurrected.</P><P>If we want to receive the rapture of Elijah and the outer garment of Elisha (the Holy Spirit), we must start from Gilgal and continue until we cross the river Jordan. The Holy Spirit can only descend upon those who are full of the resurrection life. We must not think that since we are born again, we will surely be raptured. God cannot rapture those who are not prepared. We must pass through Gilgal, Bethel, Jericho, and the river Jordan. We must pass through all these places before we can be raptured, just as Elijah did in that day. God has told us that we will be raptured. Now we need to follow our course. We should start from Gilgal and go on until we cross the Jordan. God is waiting for us there!</P><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/epub.css"><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEW COVENANT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 23</H2><P CLASS=INDENT1>(This and the following messages on the new covenant were given by Brother Nee in the second Overcomer Conference in October 1931. A later book under the same title The New Covenant is an edited and expanded version of these messages.)</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:28</H1><P>Today we will speak on God's grace and how it is manifested in the new covenant. Many people today do not understand the new covenant. The new covenant does not have any power in them. For this conference I have looked to God to give me the message that I should preach. The initial burden I had was on the new covenant. Since then, this message has been growing stronger and stronger in me. This message is a central truth; it is the truth that the Lord has committed to us. Today our message will be on the new covenant.</P><P>Every Christian, whether he is a worker or not, whether he is a beginner or has walked a long way, must know what the new covenant is in his experience. Unfortunately, if you ask ten Christians about the new covenant, probably nine of them will not be able to answer you. Try this for yourself. The new covenant is the basis of everything. Our sins are forgiven because we have the covenant. We have the strength to obey God and bear a proper testimony because we have the covenant. We thank God that this covenant is not our covenant, but God's covenant. Our sins can be forgiven, and we can have the strength to obey God, testify, and accomplish what He has committed to us because of the covenant He has enacted. Moreover, we can rest in His covenant.</P><P>If a tailor cannot use his scissors and needles skillfully, or even worse, does not know anything about them, he cannot be a tailor. If a carpenter cannot use his saw and chisel, he cannot be a carpenter. If a cook does not know how to prepare a dish, he cannot be a good cook. Similarly, if a Christian does not know about the new covenant in his experience, he will not be able to accomplish God's purpose. It would be an impossible thing to do.</P><P>One thing that comforts our hearts is that even though the new covenant is a truth that many have forgotten, it is not a truth that is opposed by them. Many truths are not wrong, yet they are opposed. Many other truths can be understood, but they are forgotten. The new covenant is a very easily forgotten truth, but it is not a truth that is rejected by men. For this reason, we can take some comfort.</P><P>Some have said that our Bible is composed of the New and Old Testaments. Strictly speaking, however, the Bible cannot be called the New and Old Testaments. The terms New Testament and Old Testament were made up by the Protestant reformers. They were not the original name of the Bible. Actually, the New Testament is within the Old Testament, and the Old Testament is within the New Testament. The Lord Jesus called the Bible the "Scripture." He always said, "Thus says the Scripture." We have gone along with men's habitual usage and called it the Old and New Testaments. Although it is not so good to call the Bible the Old and New Testaments, the reformers, nevertheless, have given us some light in distinguishing the old covenant from the new covenant.</P><P>There was a famous Englishman who was called the "sweetest soul in the world." What made him so distinguished was the letters he wrote. Once he wrote in a letter: </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Satan may have a great deal of water, but I have the fire. If we engage in a war in the air, the water and fire will clash and it will be just like thunder. I will not be afraid at all because I know that the fire belongs to Christ. As long as I put the fire in His hand, He will be responsible for keeping the coal burning.</P><P>This is dealing with Christ on the ground of the covenant. He did not beg, and he did not pray. There was no struggling and striving. He had absolute confidence and was not afraid at all. Even when the warfare was like thunder, he was still not afraid. He knew that Christ was responsible for the fire and for everything. This brother knew what a covenant is.</P><P>Mr. A. M. Toplady, who wrote the hymn "Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me," had tuberculosis of the lungs for over ten years. When he was very ill, he wrote a hymn. One of the stanzas says:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Resting in the Lord's faithfulness-<br>How sweet it is!<br>For His love is truly wonderful.<br>Resting in the Lord's gracious covenant-<br>How sweet!<br>For His covenant is forever dependable.</P><P>Unfortunately, many people do not know how to live on earth by the Lord's faithfulness and the Lord's covenant. Although we may know that the Lord's grace is sufficient for us and the Lord's love can satisfy our hearts, there are other things which we know nothing about, such as God's faithfulness and His covenant. I will speak on faithfulness and the covenant today. The above-mentioned brother shows us that we do not rest only in God's love, but also in His covenant.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT IS A COVENANT?</H2><P>All of us know that the Bible is the Word of God. God's Word reveals that grace involves three things: promises, facts, and covenants. In God's Word, there are also commandments, teachings, laws, and declarations. But as far as His Word is concerned, grace involves three things: promises, facts, and covenants. We can consider the following chart:</P><div align="center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/images/diagrams/CollectedWorks/vol9-chart.gif" width="400" height="130" border="0" alt="God's Word (in Grace) - chart"></div><P>If we want to know the meaning of a covenant, we have to know the meaning of a promise and a fact. We also have to know the difference between a promise and a fact, and what a covenant, a promise, and a fact have in common. After we know the meaning of a covenant, we will then go on one more step to see what the new covenant is.</P><P>There are two aspects to God's Word. One is what He gives to man and the other is what man is responsible for.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT IS GRACE?</H2><P>Grace is God giving us something, not our asking God for something. When God requires something from us, it involves a teaching, commandment, law, etc. These all speak of what God requires of man. They are not grace. Grace means God giving us something, God wanting to give us something, and God accomplishing something for us. There are three aspects to grace in God's Word: (1) the promises that God gives to us; (2) the facts that God has accomplished for us; and (3) the covenants that God establishes with us, which are the things that He will definitely do.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God's Promises</H2><P>A promise is very different from a fact. There are also differences among a promise, a fact, and a covenant. A promise concerns the future, while a fact concerns the past. A promise is something that one will do, while a fact is something that one has done. A promise is what God will do for man, while a fact is what God has accomplished for man. A promise is: "If you do such and such, I will do such and such." A fact is what God accomplished for us in His mercy when He realized that we were powerless and unable to go on. After God accomplished the facts, He told us the facts through the Bible.</P><P>We can give a few illustrations to show the difference between a promise and a fact. Suppose that you are very poor, and your family is not well-off. A friend sees your suffering and tells you that in three days he will send a servant to give you a thousand dollars. What is this? It is a promise. What then is a fact? When your friend sees your poverty and deposits a thousand dollars in a bank account under your name, that is a fact. Anytime you need the money, you can have it. You can use your seal or your signature to draw money from the account. This is a fact. What your friend has given you has become a definite fact. A promise is something that will be done in the future, while a fact is something that has already been done, something that you do not need to do anymore. In the Bible we can find many examples of these two kinds of words. In the Bible there are thousands of promises. At the same time, God has accomplished numerous facts for us. If God says that He will do something and He does, then that is a promise. If God says that He has done something and He has, then that is a fact. God's promises have conditions. When we fulfill the conditions, we receive what has been promised. But if something is God's fact, it is already there. There is no need to fulfill any condition; all we have to do is to believe in the fact. Now let us first consider some promises.</P><P>"`Honor your father and mother,' which is the first commandment with a promise, `that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth'" (Eph. 6:2-3). Here we see one thing: God promises that we can be well and live long on the earth. But does this mean that everyone can be well and live long on the earth? No. Everyone cannot be well and live long. Only those who honor their parents can be well and live long. Therefore, this is conditional. Most promises are conditional. God loves to see men being well and living long. But not everyone can be well and live long because not everyone fulfills the condition. If you do not fulfill this condition, you will not receive this promise. In the Bible there are some promises with conditions and other promises without conditions. Any promise that has a condition has the possibility of not being fulfilled. I do not mean that God will be unfaithful. Rather, if a man does not fulfill the condition, he will not receive the fulfillment of the promise.</P><P>"Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant" (1 Kings 8:56).</P><P>"Now, O Lord God, let thy promise unto David my father be established" (2 Chron. 1:9).</P><P>"After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise" (Num. 14:34, KJV). According to the original language, the expression my breach of promise can be rendered, "I have left my promise."</P><P>"For it was not through the law that the promise was made to Abraham or to his seed that he would be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith. For if those of the law are heirs, faith has been made void and the promise has been annulled" (Rom. 4:13-14). This verse says that if a man keeps the law, there is the possibility that the promise may be annulled.</P><P>"And these all, having obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not obtain the promise" (Heb. 11:39).</P><P>From these verses, we can see many principles concerning promises. (1) A promise requires one to beseech God for its fulfillment. A promise requires prayer and requires one to ask for the promise to be fulfilled in him. Not only do we see this in the Bible, we see this in the experience of many Christians. Many times, a man will not receive God's promise if he does not pray. (2) A promise not only requires one to ask God for its fulfillment, but the conditions also have to be fulfilled before one can receive the promise. If he does not fulfill the conditions, the promise will be annulled. Why were two million Israelites kept from entering Canaan? [Of the Israelites that left Egypt] why did only two living and two dead Israelites eventually enter Canaan? God let them wander in the wilderness for forty years because the Israelites disobeyed God in Kadesh-Barnea. This shows that God annulled His promise. Therefore, we see that a promise requires prayer. If we are not faithful to the promise and do not fulfill the conditions that should be fulfilled, the promise may be annulled. A promise must be fulfilled according to God's conditions; otherwise, it will be annulled. (3) More than just sin will annul God's promise. Romans 4 says that when we do anything or implement anything with our fleshly energy apart from God, the promise will also be annulled. (4) There is another group of people, who have prayed, have not sinned, and have not done anything by their fleshly energy apart from God; they have not done anything such as trying to do good or keeping the law. Yet they still have not received the promise. The reason for this is that the time is not yet ready. They have to wait for a certain time before they can receive what is promised.</P><P>How can God's promise be accomplished in us? Every time we see a promise in God's Word, we have to spend some time before God to pray until His Spirit rises within us, and we have the deep realization that this promise is personally for us. If a promise is without any conditions, we can receive it immediately by exercising our faith to consider this promise as ours and by believing that God will work according to His promise. Since He has promised, He will surely fulfill it. He will fulfill what He has promised in us. We can then praise and thank God, based on this faith. If a promise has a condition, we have to fulfill, obey, and deal with the matter according to the required conditions. After this, we should go to God in prayer and ask Him to accomplish His promise in us according to His faithfulness and righteousness. We should pray in this way until faith rises up within us. When this happens, we do not need to pray anymore because we know that God has heard our prayer. We can begin praising and thanking God. Soon, we will see God's promises truly fulfilled in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Facts</H2><P>The word fact is not in the Bible, but in reality, there are many accomplished facts in the Bible. A fact can also be called an accomplished work. Saying it in this way may make it more easily understandable. What is the difference between a fact and a promise? What is a fact? The death of Jesus Christ on the cross is a fact. The coming of the Holy Spirit is also a fact. Are these promises? Strictly speaking, they are no longer promises. In the Old Testament they were promises. But now they have become facts. In the Old Testament God promised that the Lord Jesus would be born of a woman under the law and would redeem men under the law. This promise has been fulfilled. Some of the promises in the Old Testament have become accomplished facts. Can we kneel down and ask God to let the Lord Jesus die for us and redeem us again? No, we cannot! But I have heard many people who pray this way. Solomon prayed for God to fulfill in him and accomplish what He had promised to David. But he did not need to ask God to make him a king because he was already a king. Doing so would be foolish. The crucifixion of the Lord Jesus has been accomplished once for all! The advent of the Holy Spirit has also been accomplished once for all. There is no need for more prayer and beseeching.</P><P>Furthermore, God has accomplished many other things in Christ. All these have become facts. The Bible shows us that many things concerning life and godliness have been accomplished in Christ. All these are accomplished and, therefore, are facts. As far as God's promises are concerned, we have to pray. If we do not pray, we will miss these promises because God will not work to accomplish His promises. But if we do not pray, will God's facts-the accomplishments of the Lord Jesus-not be fulfilled in us? No. Whatever is a fact is a fact. There is no more need to ask for it again or beseech God to accomplish it. All we have to do is believe that it is true and apply it as if it is real. The Word of God shows us that even a dying sinner can be immediately regenerated and saved if he believes in God's Word and accepts His facts. This is possible because the redemptive work of Christ has been accomplished. In the Bible God never asks us to do anything that He regards as an accomplished fact. All we have to do is to fulfill one simple step-believe.</P><P>A promise is different. A promise can be delayed, while a fact cannot be delayed. On the one hand, we cannot receive God's fact and, on the other hand, say that God will only give us what we want five years from now. What God has accomplished and has given to us in Christ cannot be withheld for a later time. Even God Himself cannot withhold His facts or delay giving them to us. If there is any withholding or delaying, it is a contradiction of the fact.</P><P>Friends, the redemption of Christ and the coming of the Holy Spirit are not the only facts; even many things that we daily attempt to solve but cannot are facts; Concerning this point, we can look at Ephesians 2:1-10: "And you, though dead in your offenses and sins, in which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience; among whom we also all conducted ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest; but God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved) and raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus, that He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast. For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them." "Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ...and raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus."</P><P>Brothers and sisters, in verses 5-6, the word "together" is used three times. Are these words God's promises or are they God's facts? God did not say that before we can be raised and ascended, we should do good and overcome the world. He said that when He raised Christ from the dead, He also raised us up. When He caused Christ to ascend, He also caused us to ascend. All these are accomplished facts. Can any one of us ask God to raise him and let ascend him with Christ? No. There is no need. If you have been joined to Christ, you are raised and ascended already. There is nothing more to ask for. If this was a promise, there still might be a need for asking. But if it is a fact, there is no need to ask and no need to pray. We should continually pay attention to this point. Many people cannot differentiate between God's fact and God's promise. They think that they must ask in order to obtain the fact. But what is the result of this asking? The more they pray, the more they lose their faith; they pray their faith away. All we have to do is to apply God's fact. There is only a need to apply; there is no need to ask.</P><P>God has shown us that the facts that He has given us are accomplished matters; there is no need to ask for them anymore. Our death, resurrection, and ascension with Christ are accomplished facts. We do not ask for God to give us a resurrected and ascended life today. If we ask, God will answer, "You have the resurrected and ascended life already." No Christian has received a life that is not the resurrected and ascended life. If we think that we can only obtain by asking, we still do not know God's accomplished works. A promise is something that God will give us, while a fact is something that God has given us. A promise is the word God will give to us when we are in trouble and pray to God for help. We can hold onto these words of promise and receive His help. Facts are all the things pertaining to life and godliness which God has already given to us in Christ. They are God's accomplished works. Since God has given them to us, there is no need for us to seek for them. All we have to do is to apply them. Hallelujah! Glorious facts! Accomplished facts! All the facts that Christ has accomplished are ours.</P><P>When we read the Bible, it is important to determine what are God's promises and what are God's facts. Every time we read about God's grace-how God has worked for us-we have to ask if this is a promise or a fact. If it is a promise, we should meet its conditions and pray much until God gives to us the assurance within that the promise is for us. We will have the faith to believe that God has heard our prayers, and we will spontaneously praise God. Although God's promise may not be fulfilled immediately, we can say by faith that it is already in our hand.</P><P>What should we do if it is a fact? Should we ask God to accomplish it again? Should we ask God to make it a reality again? Should we ask God to give it to us again? If we pray to God, "God, make me resurrect with Christ and ascend with Christ," God will say, "You have already been raised and ascended with Christ." All the facts in the Bible have already been accomplished by God. All the facts of God have been done and cannot be done again. If we see a fact, we can immediately exercise faith to thank God, saying, "God, it is so. The matter is settled." We must believe that our life is according to the fact and should begin living according to the fact. We prove our faith by such a practice. God says that we have already resurrected and ascended. We do not have to ask God to cause us to resurrect or ascend anymore. We should believe that we are indeed resurrected and ascended and thank God that we have been resurrected and ascended. Towards the world and Satan, we should adopt the attitude that we have already resurrected and ascended. We should not adopt an attitude of hoping that we will resurrect or ascend, but that we have already resurrected and ascended.</P><P>When we read the Bible, we should be very careful to determine God's facts and exercise our faith over them one by one to believe that these facts have been accomplished according to the Bible. If we do this, our spiritual life will be many times richer. If we cannot believe, we have to honestly confess that our hearts are evil and that we have an evil heart of unbelief. We should ask God to have mercy on us and remove this heart of unbelief from us. It is unfortunate that, even though God has accomplished many facts for us, we do not have any experience of them because of our lack of faith.</P><P>We can take Romans 6:6 as another example. "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves." This verse speaks about three things: sin, the old man, and the body of sin. Sin is the master, the old man is the self that likes to go along with sin, and the body is the puppet of the old man, which practices sin outwardly. Sin is the master within us which directs the old man and causes the old man to direct the body to sin. Therefore, when a man sins, he should not only blame it on the devil or inward sin. He should blame the old man-himself. We have sin within us. This sin is what we commonly call the sinful nature. The old man represents everything that comes from Adam. This old man follows sin's direction and causes the body to sin. The body is merely the outward slave. Some have thought that the way to be delivered from sin is by inwardly eradicating the root of sin. Others have thought that the way is by outwardly suppressing the body of sin. But God's work is completely different from man's work. He deals with the old man. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, God crucified us there as well. "Our old man has been crucified with Him" (6:6). Just as the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, we were crucified on the cross. God has dealt with our old man. Many times, we want to deal with our old man by ourselves. But we find that our old man is still alive in our experience. Thank God, the Lord Jesus has already crucified our old man on the cross. God has put the resurrection life of Christ within us. This is our new man. Sin has not changed and the body of sin has not changed. God has crucified the old man on the cross and the new man is now within us. Since the old man is crucified and the new man is here, we can have new hopes, new desires, new inclinations, and new thoughts. Although sin remains powerful, it cannot direct the body anymore. It is as if the body has become unemployed. "Annulled" in the original language includes the sense of being unemployed. When God crucified our old man with the Lord Jesus on the cross, the body of sin became unemployed. Since the old man is gone, the boastful mouth, the hasty hand, and the wandering eyes have all become unemployed. As a result, we are no longer a slave to sin.</P><P>Some have said that the body has hurt us and hurt us seriously; therefore, we should suppress the body. Others have said that the root of sin has hurt us and hurt us seriously; therefore, we should eradicate the root of sin. But God does not say this. God did not deal with the root of sin nor the body of sin, but with our old man, crucifying it with the Lord Jesus on the cross. As a result, the body of sin is unemployed and sin is no longer the master. The root of sin and the body of sin still exist. Even though the root of sin still tries to tempt us, the fact that we have the new man and our old man has been crucified makes it possible for every one of us to have the experience of victory.</P><P>Many have asked, "Why can I not overcome sin?" I am afraid that the problem with many people is that they only know God's promises; they do not know God's facts. They try to handle God's facts the same way that they handle God's promises. Some have thought that, before there is the possibility for victory over sin, they have to receive a "second blessing" or "second work" to remove the root of sin. But the Lord Jesus has died and resurrected. Many think that even though Christ has been crucified, they have not yet been crucified. Many think that even though Christ has been resurrected, they have not yet been resurrected. Many people do not realize that the old man has been crucified, so they beseech God to crucify their old man. They do not realize that they have been resurrected, so they ask God to grant them the resurrection life. Little do they realize that they are asking for the impossible because God has already done these things. Once He has done them, they are done forever. He cannot do them a second time. There is a great difference between promises and facts. If we do not distinguish between them, we will not progress at all in our spiritual journey because the first step in our spiritual journey, the victory over sin, is missing. A promise will be done, while a fact has been done. God does not need nor can He accomplish the facts again.</P><P>Some have asked, "If this is the case, why do we sin again? If the old man has already been crucified and if we have the new man, why do we still sin?" This leads us to a new question.</P><P>What should we do to realize God's accomplished facts?</P><P>A mistake that many people make is that they change God's facts into promises. The old man has been crucified. However, some think that God has only promised to crucify the old man. They think that they should ask God to crucify the old man. Whenever they sin, they think that their old man is still not crucified. So they again ask God to crucify it. Whenever they encounter temptations, they think that the old man has not been dealt with, and they again ask God to deal with it. They do not realize that God's facts are different from His promises. God has done many things. Facts are not things that God has promised to do.</P><P>Therefore, we do not need to pray. We do not need to have more zealous prayers, but to believe. Toward God's facts, we must only believe. If we believe, we will have the experience. Fact, faith, experience-this is the order that God has ordained, and this is a great principle in our spiritual life. We only need to do this: First, we should know God's facts. God must reveal them to us through the Holy Spirit. Second, after we know God's fact concerning a certain matter, we should lay hold of God's Word and believe that we are already according to His Word. God's fact says it and we are what His Word says. Third, we should exercise this faith and thank God that we are what He says we are and should live according to what we already are. Fourth, whenever temptations and trials come, we should believe that God's Word and facts are more reliable than our experience. All we have to do is fully believe in God's Word; He will be responsible for giving us the experience. If we only pay attention to our experience, we will fail. We should pay attention to believing in God's fact. This is our only responsibility. We can commit our experience to God because it is His responsibility.</P><P>The basis for a Christian's experience is Romans 6:6. All we have to do is to allow God's Spirit to show us how our old man is crucified. Then we should lay hold of God's Word and believe that we are dead to sin. After this, we should live as if we are already dead. Even when temptations come and tell us that we have not died, we should still believe more in what God has done than in our feelings and experience. If we do this, experience will follow. We should note that God's fact does not become real by doing this. Rather, we do this because God's fact is already real.</P><P>If our old man has not died, we could pray and ask Him to crucify it. But if the crucifixion is an accomplished fact and we still ask God to accomplish it again, then there is nothing more to say except that we are entirely lacking in faith. May we have greater faith before God. I admit that if I had not personally passed through my sickness in the past three years, I would not have known what faith is. In many places I have seen many dear brothers. But I have seldom seen a person who believes in God. What is faith? Faith is believing that whatever God has said means exactly what He has said. It is believing that everything is according to God's Word. God has said that the old man is dead. This means that our old man is dead. It is a fact that our old man is dead. A fact is something that God has accomplished through Christ. No one can say anything more about it. God sent His Son to accomplish everything for us and told us, through the Bible, what He accomplished. Now what He has accomplished is finished; God can do nothing more, and we should do nothing more than accept it before Him with a humble heart and believe that His Word is real. May our hardened hearts and evil hearts of unbelief be removed so that we will receive God's grace.</P><P>Many people do not realize the importance of faith. They think that obedience is more important. Actually, faith and obedience are equally important in the Bible and on our spiritual journey. Faith comes first, then obedience. A man must have faith before he can obey. If a man wants to obey before he believes, he is a "wretched man" indeed.</P><P>We must have faith because facts only require our faith. Faith is the only means of turning facts into experience. God's facts are almost exclusively in Christ. This means that God's facts can only become facts in Christ. Since God's facts are in Christ, we can only enjoy these facts when we are in Christ. When we believe in Christ and are joined to Him, we can experience God's accomplished facts in Christ. We must remember that apart from Christ, these things are no longer real. They are only real in Christ. Being in Christ means we are joined to Christ. This happened when we were saved. Although many people are in Christ, they do not abide in Christ. They do not exercise their faith to stand on the position that God has given them in Christ. Consequently, they lose the realization of God's fact.</P><P>Brothers, faith is truly important. Only when we believe are we in Christ. Only when we abide in Christ are God's facts our facts. May God open our eyes today to see that we are already dead, resurrected, and ascended in Christ. We should believe that we are this way in Christ. Whenever we do not have faith, we are living outside of Christ and cannot experience the facts that are in Christ. Oh, may God grant us the faith!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEW COVENANT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:28</H1><P>This morning I spoke about the difference between a promise and a fact. This afternoon, I still want to say something more about the difference between a promise and a fact so that you can become clearer.</P><P>A promise is what God says before something is done, and a fact is what God says after something has been done. A promise is God's intention concerning something that is not yet done, while a fact is His declaration after His move and His acts.</P><P>This is the difference between God's promise and His fact. We need to see one thing concerning God's promise: a believer has to receive it in faith. Concerning God's fact, we have to receive it in faith, and we also have to apply His accomplished facts and act as if we believe that they are accomplished. Since God has given something to us, we do not have to repeatedly ask Him to do the same thing; all we have to do is apply what God has given us.</P><P>Now let us say something concerning the difference between God's promise and His fact. Every time we read the Bible, we have to ask if what we are reading is a promise or a fact. If it is a promise, all we have to do is ask in faith, and we will receive it. If it is a fact, we do not have to even ask; all we have to do is apply by faith, and we will have it.</P><P>This is all we will say for now concerning the difference between a promise and a fact. Now we will add another thing: the difference between God's covenant made with an oath, and His promises and facts. In the morning, we said that God's Word concerning grace includes three aspects: promises, facts, and covenants. This afternoon, we will cover the covenants. Every heart taught by grace should praise God for His established covenants with man. If we have never encountered difficulties, we do not know the wonder and preciousness of God's covenant. Why does God establish covenants with man? Are God's promises insufficient? God's promises are indeed precious. If we have never experienced poverty, suffering, sickness, or danger we do not know the preciousness of God's promises. When we are poor, God's promises will supply us. Then we will realize that His promises are manna from heaven and springs in the wilderness. When we are in serious sickness, or when we are helpless and without aid from anyone, God's promises help and heal us. When we encounter perils, dangers, and sufferings, God's messengers will look upon us, deliver us, and comfort us according to His Word. Only then will we realize that God's promises are sweet as honey, refreshing as water, and a rock of shadow in a dry land. Here we have no danger, here we are revived, and here we are allowed to rest. Unless we pass through great tribulations, sufferings, and dangers, we will never know the preciousness and sweetness of God's promises.</P><P>While God's promises are precious, His facts are more available than His promises. God not only gives us promises which will be fulfilled; He has also given us facts that are already fulfilled. Today God is not only giving us promises and accomplished facts; He is also making covenants with us. It is more glorious for God to make a covenant with us than for Him to promise or accomplish something for us. When God establishes a covenant with us, He binds Himself. A covenant takes away God's own freedom so that we can have all that He is.</P><P>Who established the covenants with man? God established them. Do you know the meaning of a covenant? A covenant is something righteous; a covenant relates to justice and the law. Once we mention a covenant, there cannot be any consideration of personal desire, pleasure, or grace. A covenant can only be executed according to righteousness, justice, and the law. Grace cannot execute a covenant. Suppose that I agreed to give a brother five dollars every morning. Do not ask why I would make such a covenant with the brother; just remember that if I made such a covenant, I would have to give him five dollars every morning. Since I made such a covenant and signed my name in the covenant, I would be unrighteous and dishonest if I did not keep this covenant. I would be acting contrary and unfaithfully to my own words. This would immediately lower my own moral standard. Doing this would be acting contrary to law and justice; rather, I would be acting according to my own will. Have you seen that when God makes a covenant with man, He puts Himself in a very restricted position? God is able to deal with man according to His own will. If He so desired, He could deal with you in grace, and if He did not desire, He could deal with you harshly. If He so desired, He could save you one day, and if He did not desire, He could choose not to save you the next day. If God is not bound by a covenant, He can act freely according to His own pleasure. If He is outside a covenant, He can hold back His will. He has the freedom to do this. If He wants to do something, He can do it. If He does not want to do something, He can choose not to do it. But if God has made a covenant, He is bound by it. God has to act according to the covenant. Hallelujah! God is bound by the covenant. God has sacrificed His desires and His freedom for the sake of the covenant! Brothers and sisters, do you realize that this is the highest expression of grace? This is not just God's promising us a plenitude of food and raiment, or deliverance from dangers and sufferings. This is not just the declaration of God's accomplished facts for our application. This is God putting Himself in our position; God has put Himself in a covenant. Whether or not He likes it, God has to carry out the covenant. No matter what His desire is, He has to carry the covenant out. He cannot change the words in His covenant. What a wonderful thing that God has established covenants with us.</P><P>Covenants are different from grace. The difference between covenants and grace is the difference between law and grace. For example, if refugees came to us asking for relief during a flood, we could do as we pleased. If we wanted to, we could help them. If we did not want to, we would not have to help them. We would have absolute freedom. If we had mercy on them, we could send some relief to them. If we did not have mercy on them and did not send any relief to them, no one could force us to do anything. We would have complete liberty to do whatever we wanted to do. But if we made a covenant with them to supply them with food and drink for three months, then we would have to begin preparing food for them today. My friends, that would not be just grace. Giving them food yesterday would be a matter of grace. Giving them food today, even though it could be considered grace, is actually a matter of righteousness, justice, and law. It would not be grace alone. We are carrying out a promise that we made yesterday. We are just carrying out our covenant today. If we do not give them food today, we are being more than unmerciful, we are being unrighteous. What has been promised must be done. God has made covenants with us; He has promised us. If God does not work according to His promise, what will become of Him? If He does not do this, He would be unfaithful, dishonest, and unrighteous. If God has not promised us anything, we can only say that He does not have the grace to give or the mercy to grant to us. But if He does not fulfill His promise, He would be unrighteous. Who can say that God is unrighteous? God would rather lose His freedom; He can never lose His righteousness.</P><P>Now let us consider some covenants made in the Bible, and see how covenants are different from facts and promises. First we will consider Hebrews 6:13-18 which says that there are two things that cannot be changed, God's promise and His oath. Abraham was greatly encouraged by this. When God made a covenant with Abraham, He gave him two unchangeable things. One was an unchangeable promise. The other was an unchangeable oath. Let us see how God gave a promise and an oath to Abraham.</P><P>Please read Genesis 15:1-13. This portion of the Word records God's promise to Abraham of descendants and land. God said to him, "Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward" (v. 1). When Abraham heard it, he said, "Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?" (v. 2). This word shows that Abraham did not yet believe in God's promise. God said to him, "This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir" (v. 4). Verse 6 says, "And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness." Friends, please pay attention to this verse. What did the Lord tell Abraham? He told him a promise, not a fact. God promised Abraham that he would have a son, and his seed would be numerous. The Lord asked if he could count the number of the stars and told him that the number of his seed would be as the stars. This is not a fact, but a promise. At that time Abraham did not have a son, and the promise was not yet fulfilled. Abraham believed God's promise. God was pleased with him and justified him. Abraham became a giant of faith.</P><P>God has His promises for us. If we believe in them, we will become extraordinary people. We are all limited in our capacity. God's promises are too great, and it seems that we cannot hold them. We may be able to believe one promise of God. But we are not able to believe in the second and the third promises because of the smallness of our faith. We may think that it is a tremendous thing to believe in one promise, and that this is enough. We may think that we cannot believe in another promise and that we do not have the capacity to receive greater blessings. But if we can believe in God's first promise, He will right away give us a second promise.</P><P>God took Abraham outside and told him to look toward heaven and count the stars. Could he count them? Then God said to him, "So shall thy seed be." Abraham believed this promise. As a result, God's second promise came. Verse 7 says, "I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it." God not only promised that Abraham's seed would be as numerous as the stars, He also promised that Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey, would be given to his seed. When Abraham heard this promise, what did he do? Unfortunately, his capacity was too small; he could not receive so much. Verse 8 says, "And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?" Abraham doubted. The promise was too great. How could Abraham know that he would receive Canaan as his inheritance? How could he believe such a great promise? If God just told him that he would have families, he could believe that. But when God told him that he would have an inheritance, he could not believe. He could believe in seed as numerous as the stars in heaven. But he could not believe that he would inherit Canaan, and that his descendants would drive out the seven strong tribes and inherit their lands. Abraham could believe in God giving him the seeds, but he could not believe that he would inherit the land in addition to having the seed. Friends, we often commit the same mistake. We believe one promise of God, but do not believe another promise. If God promises us this, we believe it. But if He promises us that, we cannot believe it. We often choose what we want to believe and can believe from among the many promises of God. Those that we cannot believe, we do not believe. Some brothers believe that God can supply their needs, but do not believe that God will heal their sicknesses. Some believe that God will heal them, but do not believe that God will supply their needs. Some believe that God will heal them, but do not believe that God will protect and deliver them from dangers. It is even possible for some people to believe at one time, that God will deliver them from dangers, but later no longer believe in His deliverance. For example, when Elijah confronted the prophets of Jezebel on Mount Carmel, he fully believed that God would protect him from the harm of the enemy. He was bold to prevail over the false prophets. But soon after that, he became afraid of Jezebel's plot and escaped to Beersheba (1 Kings 19:3).</P><P>Many times we choose the things that we want to believe from among God's promises, believe them, and reject those that we do not believe. We believe some of God's promises but do not believe others. This is wrong. If we could believe what God has promised, like Abraham, everything would be well. What will God do when we cannot believe? He has promised, and He cannot break His promises. He has promised, but we cannot come up to His standing to receive these promises. Therefore, He has to lower Himself to our standing, so that we can receive His promises boldly.</P><P>When Abraham believed God's first promise, God gave what He promised to him. Later, when God gave Abraham the second promise, he could not believe it. What did God then do? He made a covenant with Abraham, so that he would believe. A covenant makes up for what a promise lacks. It is the best way to deal with unbelief. Even though we may not believe, God cannot change what He has promised. Therefore, our unbelief forces Him to make a covenant with us so that we will believe.</P><P>Abraham did not believe God's second promise. What did God do? Genesis 15:9-10 says, "And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not." What does this mean? Abraham understood what this meant. This was the way men covenanted with each other in his day. When a person entered into a covenant with another person, he cut a heifer or a goat in half and laid each half of the sacrifice against the other. The one who made the covenant would then walk through the two halves of the sacrifice as a sign that he had covenanted with the other party. This sign signified that the covenant passed through the heart and organs, and was sealed with blood. The body of an animal was cut in half and the blood was shed, then God Himself passed through the two halves. This signifies that the covenant that He had made would never change and never fail. After He did this, "in that same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates" (v. 18).</P><P>Friends, have you seen this? In Genesis 15, God gave half of the promise to Abraham, which was to have seed as numerous as the stars in heaven. After he believed this promise and accepted this promise, God gave to him the promise of the land. God had not only promised him a family, but an inheritance. He not only promised him descendants, but a land for them to dwell in and live on. Abram did not have the capacity to accept this promise. If God had not opened His mouth, His words would not be fulfilled. However, since God had uttered His promise, He had to fulfill His words according to His promise. If a man did not believe it, however, the promise would be made of none effect. For this reason, God had to make a covenant with man, so that man would realize that God had to fulfill His word and carry it out so that there would be no unfaithfulness on His part. Unfaithfulness is a sin; God could surely not do such a thing. To promise something without giving it is unrighteous and dishonest. It is walking contrary to the highest standard of morality. God did not only give a promise and facts for man to apply. God did not only say with His mouth what He would do for man and show man the accomplished facts. He made a covenant with man with the intention that man could lay hold of Him through the covenants. God knew that Abram had only so much faith. The inheritance that God promised was too great and wonderful; it was beyond the capacity of his faith. God knew that He had to increase the capacity of Abram's faith. God covenanted with Abram to increase his faith. Not only did God promise to do it, He made a covenant to do it so that Abram could not do anything other than believe. Once God had made a covenant, it would be unfaithful, unrighteous, and illegal for Him not to act according to His covenant. Under this circumstance, faith has to increase. The reason God makes a covenant with us, and does not just give promises or facts to us, is because He cares for the smallness of our faith in the same way that He cared for Abraham's lack of faith. He wants us to learn to lay hold of His righteousness, faithfulness, and rightful glory, just as Abraham did. It is a small thing for us to lose our blessing; it is a great thing for God to lose His credibility. Now let me read some Scriptures where men dealt with God on the basis of covenants, so that you will understand the matter more fully.</P><P>Psalms 143:1, "Hear my prayer, O Lord, / give ear to my supplications: / in thy faithfulness answer me, / and in thy righteousness." David was not asking God to answer him according to His mercy, lovingkindness, or grace, but according to His faithfulness and righteousness. I have heard many people praying for God to answer them in His mercy and love, or according to His will. But David's prayer was different from others. He did not ask God to grant him grace, or bless him with mercy and lovingkindness. His prayer was special. He only prayed that God would answer him according to His righteousness and faithfulness. The word in here means "according to." He prayed that God would answer him according to His righteousness and faithfulness. What does this mean? Do you know the meaning of this? Frankly speaking, only those who understand this point know how to pray. Anyone who does not understand this, will not have their prayers answered. Their prayers will be ineffective. Sometimes we ask God to grant us grace and mercy, and accomplish His will. But sometimes, these prayers are absolutely meaningless. When we do not have God's promise or God's Word, it is all right to pray such prayers. But when God has promised, and when He has given us His Word, these prayers indicate unbelief and become a sin.</P><P>We have to ask God to accomplish His will. But sometimes, this kind of prayer is offered in either ignorance or unbelief. Sometimes when a person prays for a sick one, he does not pray for God to heal, nor does he pray for God to not heal. He merely prays that God will act according to His will. Apparently, this is very good. But many times, this is a sign of ignorance. This kind of prayer exposes the laziness of the praying ones; they are not willing to spend the time to seek after God's will and pray according to His will. They only know how to pray to God in an ignorant way. When some start to pray for others, they ask God to heal them and help them to recuperate quickly. But when the illness becomes serious or terminal, they change their tone and ask that God's will be done. This prayer really means: "God, You are not answering my prayer now, and I cannot pray for the healing anymore. This person is critically ill, and there is no chance for him to get better. Therefore, I only ask that Your will be done, and that You allow him to die." What kind of prayer is this? This kind of prayer does not have any assurance or any faith to it.</P><P>Do you think that at the present time God is dealing with you only according to grace? God surely deals with you in grace. But grace is the flow, while righteousness is the channel. God not only deals with man according to grace today; He also deals with man in grace through righteousness. His rich grace is dispensed to us through His righteousness. "Grace might reign through righteousness" (Rom. 5:21). I hope that you will not misunderstand me. God has not only promised, but He has made a covenant with us. This is why He cannot break His covenant; He cannot take back the words of His covenant. Anyone can say to God today, "You have established Your covenant. Now I ask You to fulfill the words of the covenant according to Your righteousness." If God will not accomplish what His covenant says, I can reverently say that God is being unrighteous. This, of course, can never happen. I am afraid that some may think that what I am saying is too much. They may think that this gospel is too good to be true and do not believe that it can be this good. Many people think that God acts according to His will and His pleasure. But I must tell you that concerning our redemption, God never acts according to His will or His pleasure. He cares for our weaknesses and knows that our faith cannot match His promise. So He made His promise into a covenant and covenanted with man so that we will have the boldness to stand on His ground, lay hold of His Word, and ask Him to fulfill His promise according to His righteousness. Concerning our redemption, we are not standing here asking God to change His mind or to grant us mercy. This type of asking is not completely wrong; sometimes we can ask in this way. If we want to receive God's promise, we can ask God to fulfill His promise in this way. But if God's promise has become a covenant with us, all we have to do is appropriate and apply it by faith.</P><P>God is bound by His covenant. God no longer has His will, liberty, or pleasure. He has to be faithful and righteous. Read 1 John 1:9 again, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Friends, have you realized the distinctiveness of this verse? Many times we say that a person who prays in this way does not sound like the publican in the temple, who prayed for God to be merciful to him, a sinner. But this prayer asks God to forgive sins and cleanse from all unrighteousness according to His righteousness and faithfulness. If God has not promised the forgiveness of sins in the Bible, we have to pray for Him to be merciful to us, the sinners. But if the Bible has promised the forgiveness of sins, we do not have to pray for God to grant mercy to us; all we have to do is apply it by faith. God has allowed His words to be caught in our hands. We can seize them and say to Him, "Forgive my sins and cleanse my unrighteousness according to Your righteousness and faithfulness." If God did not forgive or cleanse us, He would be unrighteous because the Lord Jesus died for us on the cross, shed His precious blood, and bore our sins. His death has become our death. When He shed His blood and bore the punishment, it was as if we were judged and punished there. Since the Lord has died, and since God has accepted this sacrifice, God has to forgive our sins and cleanse our unrighteousness according to His faithfulness and righteousness.</P><P>Friends, God truly has no way to not forgive our sins. Whether He wants to or not, He has to forgive our sins. If He did not forgive our sins, He would be dishonest. Even if God does not want to forgive our sins now, He still must do so. God has not only given us the promise of grace, He is keeping His covenant with us in righteousness. If the Lord had not died on the cross, God could choose not to forgive us. But the Lord has died on the cross. Therefore, He has to forgive us. This is not just God's promise, but God's covenant with us. God has graced us to such a point that He has covenanted with us so that we will believe in Him. If we still cannot believe in God's covenant, truthfully speaking, God can do nothing more; He has done His best. If God had not made a covenant for the forgiveness of sins, He could choose not to forgive us. But He has made a covenant for the forgiveness of sins. If we have received the words of this covenant, He would be unfaithful if He did not forgive us. Being unfaithful is lying, and lying is immoral and sin. Even thinking that God would act this way is sin itself! God has made a covenant with us, and He must act according to His covenant. Thank God that He is willing to put aside His will and desires, and that He is willing to stand on the ground of being bound by the covenant. He is no longer free. God has to take care of His covenant in a righteous way. The Lord has redeemed us, shed His blood for us, and been crucified for us. God has to forgive our sins because He cannot be unrighteous.</P><P>May we see that we are standing on a special ground, and that we are different from ordinary men. If God had not made a covenant with us, and if He had not promised us, He would be free to forgive us or not to forgive us. Then if He was happy, He could cleanse us, and when He was not happy, He could choose not to cleanse us. He could act according to His freedom and will. But God has lost His pleasure and freedom. He is bound and cannot have any other will besides the covenant that He has made with us. God did this in order that we would come to Him with boldness and say, "Please forgive my sins and cleanse my unrighteousness according to Your faithfulness and righteousness." For Him to forgive us is righteousness. Unfortunately, many people pray without any faith. Many prayers are signs of unbelief. I am not overturning your prayers. I am saying that prayer is indeed a very important thing to a Christian. But the prayers of many people are as full of unbelief as the disciples' cry for help to the Lord Jesus on the boat. When the Lord was with the disciples on the boat, they met a great storm. The boat was about to sink, but the Lord was fast asleep at the stern of the boat. The disciples frantically woke the Lord up saying, "Teacher,...we are perishing!" (Mark 4:38). What did the Lord reply? He did not praise them for being watchful in prayer. He said, "How is it that you do not have faith?" (v. 40). The Lord rebuked them for their lack of faith. Why did the Lord rebuke them? He rebuked them because they had forgotten His word, "Let us go over to the other side" (v. 35). If the Lord had never said such a word, their alarming prayers would not have been bad. But since the Lord said to "go over to the other side," there was nothing that could have stopped them from going over to the other side. Many people think that the more we pray, the wordier our prayers are, and the more desperate we become, the better it is. But I have to say that these beggings only expose the unbelief of the begging ones, or their ignorance of the fact of the promise and the covenant that God has made with them. Perhaps one of the chief reasons that our prayers are not answered is that we have not seen God's covenant. Why is God's power manifested so poorly? Perhaps one reason that we have failed is that before the Lord, we have not laid hold of the "handle" God has given to us. Instead, we think that God deals with us according to some incomprehensible preference and some inexplicable will of His. If we want to overcome, we have to lay hold of the Word God has given to us and use it as our handle. When we finish our prayer, or when we like what others pray, we say, "Amen." What is the meaning of the word amen? We think that amen means "may such a thing be accomplished." But Mr. Gordon said that the word amen does not mean a wish for something to be accomplished, but a declaration that it will surely be accomplished, and that there is no doubt about it. If you think that God deals with you in mercy, and you want Him to hear your prayer based on His kindness and mercy, you will not have any confidence. If He will not be gracious to you, what can you do? When this happens, you can do nothing. I am not saying that you should not pray this way. At the right time, you can pray this way. God deals with us today according to the principle of righteousness and faithfulness. His grace is hidden in righteousness and faithfulness. He deals with us according to a covenant. Please remember that from the time that the Lord Jesus died on the cross, God's communication with us has been based on the covenant that He made with us. Outside this covenant, He will not do anything. Today many believers do not understand God's promise, His fact, and His Word. They beg desperately according to their feelings, but do not receive anything. What they lack is faith. May we henceforth pray less and believe more. When we give up praying and instead believe more, we will see that everything will be all right. By then, we will understand what the new covenant is. We will understand that it is not just grace, but grace through righteousness.</P><P>Do we know what a covenant is? A covenant means "a bondage, a loss of freedom and self will." When God makes a covenant with us, even if He later regrets making such a covenant, I can reverently say that He cannot touch an established covenant which He has made. He has no way to change the covenant. Hallelujah! God is bound by the covenant. We will never lose the blessing of the covenant. It is not too important if we do not know, for the moment, what the new covenant is, or how much the new covenant includes. As long as we know that God has made a covenant with us, we are blessed.</P><P>What an amazing thing that God would want to make a covenant with us and would want His word to be "caught" by us. Men are always afraid that they will be "caught" by others in their words. In order to build up our faith, God is not afraid of us catching Him at His word. In fact, He loves to see us catching Him at His word. Let us consider the story of Abraham. We are now clear about the difference between a covenant and a promise. God gave to Abraham a promise. When Abraham could not believe it, God ordered him to cut a sacrifice in half, and He passed through it. This made His promise an unchangeable covenant. In this way, Abraham believed. A covenant is a promise that God guarantees the fulfillment of with His faithfulness, righteousness, and highest standard of morality. If God's faithfulness, righteousness, and upright morality fail, God Himself fails. But such a covenant will never fail. God and His covenant exist together. If God failed, His covenant would be made of none effect. But as long as God remains, His covenant remains. If we say that a covenant can be annulled, we are saying that God can be annulled. Saying this blasphemes God. May God deliver us from unbelief and blasphemy.</P><P>The sacrifice used in the covenant in this record is also very meaningful. A heifer signifies Christ's patient and toiling life, and Christ as the peace offering. A she goat signifies Christ's fruitfulness, and Christ as the sin offering. A ram signifies Christ as the powerful victor being slain, and Christ as the burnt offering. The two birds signify Christ being from heaven; the turtledove signifies Christ's suffering life, and the young pigeon signifies Christ's life of faith, by which He daily looked to God for His living. This shows us that the covenant God made with us is in Christ and is as firm as a seal; it is eternally immutable. The covenant that God made with us was made through the work of Christ and in Christ. God not only promised salvation, but accomplished redemption. Now there is not only a promise, there is also a fact. This covenant is as firm as the work of Christ.</P><P>In the Bible there are many covenants and promises, and we cannot consider them all. We can only consider the covenants that God made with Abraham and David. In Matthew the genealogy of the Lord Jesus tells us that Christ is the descendant of Abraham and the descendant of David. Hence, we can consider these two as representatives in the matter of covenant making. Both 2 Samuel 7:4-15 and Psalm 89:19-37 show us this matter. Samuel did not show us how God made the covenant with David. But Psalm 89 shows us that Jehovah sent Nathan the prophet to David; the word that he said to David was a covenant. David wanted to build a temple for Jehovah, and Jehovah sent Nathan the prophet to him saying, "I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle...Also the Lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house. And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of His kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever" (2 Sam. 7:6, 11b-16). Psalms records the same thing as 2 Samuel, but it points out that this was a covenant. "My covenant shall stand fast with him. /  His seed also will I make to endure for ever, / and his throne as the days of heaven. / If his children forsake my law, / and walk not in my judgments; / if they break my statutes, / and keep not my commandments;/ then will I visit their transgression with the rod, / and their iniquity with stripes. / Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, / nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. / My covenant will I not break, / nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips" (Psa. 89:28b-34). God gave His word to the descendants of David as a "handle" for them to lay hold of. He loves to see man taking hold of His word and using it as a means to demand fulfillment from Him. God is pleased to see man doing this. He allows His word to fall into man's hand so that man would specifically do this.</P><P>One day a Canaanite woman asked the Lord to heal her daughter of her sickness. The Lord did not answer her. After the woman pleaded with earnestness, the Lord opened His mouth and said that He was sent to seek the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and that it was not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs. The Lord compared her, a Gentile, to a little dog, and the house of Israel to the children. He was telling the woman that she was not worthy of such blessing. The Lord's word seemed to build a wall around Himself that kept the woman from coming any closer to Him. But the woman caught the Lord's word, and said that even the little dogs could eat the children's crumbs. When she said this, the Lord healed her daughter, and He praised her as being great in her faith (Matt. 15:22-28). God loves to see man taking hold of His word and asking Him to do things based on such words. In His dealings with us, He loves to leave a "handle" for us to take hold of Him, like He did with the woman. But He was afraid that we would not see the handle. As a result, He gave us a greater and more obvious handle, a covenant with us, so that we could believe in Him. The Holy Spirit allowed the woman to find a catch in the Lord's word. She found one word which served as her handle to ask for more. In His parable, the Lord only mentioned the food of the children. He did not mention food for the little dogs. The Lord only mentioned the bread. He did not mention the crumbs of the bread. When the Lord said that she was a dog and not the children, she did not object. But should not dogs also have food? Could they not even eat the crumbs? She found a handle in the Lord's word. When she asked the Lord to give her the crumbs, the Lord could not ignore her, but had to respond to her. The reason for this is that He is faithful, and He leaves a "handle" in His word for man. When man lays hold of such a handle, God is most pleased.</P><P>The Lord said clearly to David, that even if his descendants were to forsake His commandments and break His laws, He could not break His covenant. Do you know when Psalm 89 was written? It was written at the time the Jews were captured in Babylon, at the time of captivity. The people thought that God had forgotten His covenant with David. God promised that David's descendants would continue on the throne, and that his kingdom and house would be forever. But the kingdom was gone, and the people were exiled into the enemy's land. Where was the king? How could the kingdom and house be established? In the middle of all these visible things, the psalmist said to God, "But thou hast cast off and abhorred, / thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. / Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: / thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground" (vv. 38-39). First he mentioned God's covenant. Then he continued with the captivity of his countrymen and their suffering under the enemy. When he came to verse 49, he seized the covenant and interrogated God, "Lord, where are thy former loving-kindnesses, / which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?" Notice this word: "Lord, where are thy former loving-kindnesses, / which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?" Friends, have we ever prayed this way? Have we ever been so bold in our prayer? Many people beg for the Lord's mercy like beggars. We have never said to God, "Lord, execute the covenant that You made with me according to Your faithfulness." The Holy Spirit purposely records this interrogating prayer to God; it shows us that God loves to see us interrogating Him according to a "handle" in His word. When we do this, it gives Him far more glory. We have said many wavering words to God; all these words come from an evil heart of unbelief. Although we have prayed to God, we do not have any assurance at all. How can God answer our prayers? The problem is not on God's side, but on our side. If we believe, God will surely forgive our sins and cleanse our unrighteousness. He will surely fill us with the Holy Spirit and give His life to us so that we can live, grow, and be obedient children according to His new life. With His life, we will become perfect, even as His Son the Lord Jesus was perfect, clean, undefiled, and without blemish. Can we achieve all this? On God's side, there is no problem. The problem is whether or not we will believe in His word. Just as He made a covenant with David and promised His loving-kindness to him, He has made a covenant with us, who have believed in the name of His Son, and has promised us unmatched spiritual blessings. God loves to see us drawing nigh to Him, seeking after Him, and interrogating Him according to His covenant. He loves to see us taking His same standing and communicating with Him, demanding that He fulfill all that He has promised in His covenant. At this point, I have to exalt and thank God, for He has given us many "handles" in His Word so that we can lay hold of them and apply them.</P><P>Our God is worthy of all praises. He will surely fulfill what He has promised and covenanted with us. Brothers and sisters, have you ever realized that God has given us "handles" in His Word by which we can believe in Him? Today, we present you this glorious truth. God has not only given us His promises and facts, He has given us the greatest handle of all-His covenant, by which we can lay hold of Him. Tomorrow we will see how much this covenant includes. Presently we have seen that God has made a covenant with us and promised to accomplish the things said in the covenant for us. The believers who are weak, despondent, and cold should realize that God has made a covenant with us. He has put this handle in our hand. Let us come to Him in all boldness, interrogate Him according to this covenant, and deal with Him because this is His Word. He says that whoever believes in Him will see Him accomplishing things for them. The only reason the church is so feeble in strength is that it does not know the new covenant. The new covenant has been forgotten!</P><P>Has not the Bible taught us about the new covenant? When we read the Bible, we will find out that we are now in the New Testament age; we will see that the Lord Jesus died and shed His blood for the enactment of the new covenant. Since we know the Bible and the term the new covenant, why are we so weak and powerless? The reason is that the letter kills, while the Spirit gives life. We know that this is the New Testament age, but we do not know how to bargain with God and apply God's promises to us. In this conference, we want to consider how precious and wonderful the covenant is. We want to see how much the new covenant includes. But in order to receive the blessing of the new covenant, we must have an honest and upright heart before God. We must not only listen to the truth and know about the truth, we must also receive God's revelation before we can have the strength to believe and to receive. Psalm 25:14 says, "The intimate counsel of Jehovah belongs to those who fear Him, / And His covenant will He make known to them." Unless the Lord shows us His covenant, we have no way to know about it. We can hear men speaking about God's covenant, and our mind can understand something concerning the covenant. But when we go home, we are still the same as before; we have not received anything. We are still weak and have not taken hold of God's Word. We need God to grant us a revelation in our spirit. However, we must first fear God before He can show us anything. What does it mean to fear God? Fearing God means wanting God, desiring single-heartedly to keep His will, being fully submissive to Him, wanting nothing of ourselves, walking not according to our will, seeing not ourselves, and seeing God's greatness alone. According to the Hebrew language, Psalm 25 is in parallel form, where two sentences are parallel one to another, saying the same thing. The first sentence says that the Lord reveals His intimate counsel to those who fear Him. The second sentence says that He will make His covenant known to them. From this we see that the intimate counsel of the Lord is His covenant, the covenant of God. Today, God's intimate counsel, the covenant, is before us. We should fear Him, exalt Him, and consider ourselves as nothing. In this way we will see God's covenant; we will be able to inquire of God by laying hold of His covenant, and we will receive the blessing of the new covenant. May God work in this conference. May He attract men and lead men to know His secret. On the one hand, we have to be careful about God's covenant because this is holy ground, and everyone who comes to Him has to fear Him. On the other hand, may we come boldly before Him because this covenant is filled with grace.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEW COVENANT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 25</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:28</H1><P>Matthew 26:28 shows us that although the blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins, the blood is also the "blood of the covenant." The blood is first related to the covenant. The nature of the blood is of the covenant. The function of the blood is for the forgiveness of sins. While it is true that the shedding of the blood is for the redemption and forgiveness of sins, it is the blood of the covenant that forgives sins. If the blood were not the blood of the covenant, even though it was shed, it could not bring in forgiveness. The reason that the shedding of blood forgives sins is that God had made a covenant with man in which the shedding of the blood would bring about the forgiveness of sins. This is why the shedding of blood can forgive sins. Therefore, this verse tells us the nature of the shedding of the blood. The shedding of the blood is related to the new covenant, while the effect of the shed blood is the forgiveness of sins.</P><P>God's Word reveals that grace involves three aspects: promises, facts, and covenants. We have mentioned promises and facts and will not repeat it today. Now we will consider a covenant made with an oath. This is the central message of our conference this time. We want to see what the covenant that God has made-the new covenant-is for. Some have said that there are a total of eight covenants in the Bible. I do not know if this is right. However many there may be, the new covenant is the most important of them all.</P><P>Within a covenant, there are also promises and facts. The Bible tells us clearly that God's covenant is a promise. God's promise is what He has said with His own mouth, while God's covenant is what He has made with an oath. A promise binds a person, but a covenant binds a person even more. Furthermore, a covenant cannot be annulled. Therefore, when God made a covenant with Abraham, He swore by Himself. God not only promised Abraham but swore to him. Thank and praise God that He has not only promised us but also made a covenant with us so that we can draw near to God and lay hold of Him with boldness, according to His righteousness and faithfulness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REASON A COVENANT CONTAINS<br>A PROMISE AND A FACT</H2><P>Hebrews 9:15-18 explains to us the reason that the covenant contains a promise and fact. Verse 16 says, "For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established." The word testament is the same as the word covenant in the original language. The New Testament means "the new covenant" in the original language. In the Bible there are two meanings to the word covenant: (1) a covenant, and (2) a will, or a testament. Therefore, the new covenant can be considered both a covenant as well as a testament or a will of God. Without a promise, a covenant cannot be established. Any covenant contains a promise. For example, a certificate of loan is a covenant. Within this certificate, there is a promise. An ordinary promise does not usually have a document with it. However, a promise made in a covenant is supported by a legal procedure and bound by the law. Therefore, God's covenant includes God's promise. But it is higher than His promise. There is not much difference between God's promise and His covenant for those who have been deeply taught by God's grace and who know God in an intimate way. They know that God is faithful, just as He is righteous. Therefore, whatever God has promised, He will not leave unfulfilled. They do not have to see legal evidence for all the promises before they believe in them. They consider God's promises to be God's covenants. But for those who are weak in faith, God's promise and covenant still need to be distinguished from each other. Therefore, we cannot say that all promises are covenants. But we can say that all covenants have promises.</P><P>A covenant contains not only a promise but a testament. Therefore, with a covenant there is not only a promise but also a fact. What is willed is the fact. For example, a father may will something to his son. His testament tells of the way to dispose of his possessions. The inheritance is the result of the father's labor which the son can obtain without any work of his own. As long as he is the son, he can enjoy the inheritance. Therefore, there must be facts within a testament. Within the covenant there is a testament and inheritance. Therefore, within a covenant there is a fact.</P><P>The three aspects of grace that God has given to us in the Bible are promises, facts, and covenants. A covenant is higher than a promise or a fact. But a covenant includes a promise and a fact. Without these two things, a covenant is empty. Thank God that there are many promises that are related to the new covenant. There are also many facts that are related to the new covenant. Now we want to consider the nature of a covenant, the basis of a covenant, the relationship a covenant has with us, and the security of a covenant, etc. Suppose you receive a check or a bank draft. The first thing you want to see is the amount; when you see it you are happy. But if the check is void, it is useless. Today I can tell you that this check is very reliable and trustworthy. It can be cashed. You can be sure that you can safely draw money from it.</P><P>How do we know that a covenant is reliable? How can we tell that a testament is reliable? We know that many covenants established by many nations are not reliable. Our first need is not to ask what the covenant or a testament has given to us. Our first need is to ask if such a covenant or testament is reliable.</P><P>"For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (Matt. 26:28). The cup is the cup of the new covenant, and the blood is in the new covenant. The new covenant is in the blood of the new covenant. The blood of the new covenant has a wonderful effect, which is to cleanse sins. The direct purpose of the shedding of the Lord Jesus' blood was for the establishing of the covenant. How strange it is that one has to shed his blood to establish a covenant! Why is a covenant only effective when blood is shed? I deeply believe that if every Christian knew that the blood of the Lord Jesus established a covenant, we would not be as bound, restricted, and powerless, and we would not receive only a few answers to prayer and few results in our work as we do today. Brothers and sisters, we have fallen to such a condition because we have put the new covenant aside. We know the term the new covenant, but we have forgotten its use. This is why we have fallen to such a state.</P><P>God established a few covenants in the past. He established a covenant with Noah. He also established a covenant with Abraham. He also established a covenant with Jacob, even though it was not called one explicitly. He also established a covenant with the Israelites who left Egypt. But there is still another covenant which He enacted through the Lord Jesus Christ. There are other covenants besides these. Although there are many covenants, the two most important ones are the one made with Abraham and the new covenant. All the other covenants are less crucial and affect a smaller sphere. The new covenant follows immediately after the covenant God made with Abraham. The new covenant is a further development of the covenant God made with Abraham and inherits what God promised to Abraham. The book of Galatians tells us that the covenant God made with Abraham is the proper covenant, while the covenant of the law was only an insertion between two covenants. Only Abraham's covenant of promise and the new covenant are proper covenants. In between the covenant of promise and the new covenant, another covenant was inserted. This is the so-called "old covenant," or old testament, which lasted for fifteen hundred years. The old testament is not the thirty-nine books that we have which span from Genesis to Malachi. Actually, the proper name of these thirty-nine books is the Holy Scripture. The actual time of the old testament begins from Exodus 19 and ends with the death of the Lord Jesus. Before the old testament or covenant, there was the covenant which God made with Abraham from which the new covenant follows.</P><P>Originally, when man was created, he was well preserved. Because of the fall through sin, there was the action of the conscience, and man walked according to his conscience. But two thousand five hundred years after God created the world, man was still sinning. For this reason, God told Moses to enact a covenant (the law) with man. God promised the Israelites that they would be a royal priesthood, a kingdom of priests. But the condition of the old covenant was bilateral. This is why there were two tablets of the law in the tabernacle. On the one side, the Israelites had to keep the law. On the other side, God would bless them if they kept it. If they could not keep God's law, God would punish them. This is the picture of the old covenant.</P><P>As far as the condition in Eden is concerned, the blood of the Lord Jesus is necessary. As far as the law is concerned, the blood of the Lord Jesus is also necessary. What was the picture of the exile from Eden? It was a loss of position, inheritance, and a loss of life. Man had to labor in the sweat of his face. I always consider sin to be a big minus sign; our body, spiritual life, as well as all that we should have inherited from our Creator were lost because of sin. All these were lost through Adam.</P><P>There was a long period from Adam to Moses. The period from Moses to Christ was also a very long period. From Adam to Moses, death reigned, while from Moses to Christ, not just death reigned, but death and sin reigned. Sin has been present since Adam, and death has been reigning because the result of sin is death. What is death? It is the totality of sin. Sin is like small rivers and streams, while death is like the sea. The general name for the whole period between Adam and Moses is death. Exile, curses, laboring in birth, thorns, pain, and sweat, all point to death. All of these things signify death. The end of these things is death. Death is like the sea into which all the streams and rivers feed.</P><P>This is what we lost in Eden through Adam, and this is what we gained through Adam. We did not lose just a few things; we lost everything. Two thousand five hundred years later, Moses received the covenant of the law from God on Mount Sinai. The covenant said that if man kept the words of the covenant, God would bless him. However, if he could not keep the words of the covenant, God would punish him. What has the law added to us? It has added nothing. Is it an addition? No. This is why death reigned from Adam to Moses, while both death and sin reigned from Moses to Christ. Previously, there was just death. There was sin in addition to death. The law did nothing except expose sin. This was indeed a big minus. Not only was there no blessing, but there was sin and curse as well.</P><P>Before Christ came, man had incurred two great losses. The first loss was through Adam. The second loss was through Moses. These losses have kept man from receiving answers to prayers and have caused man to fail and not overcome. Man was estranged and kept from the enjoyment of God's presence. Man became foolish and ignorant of God. He became weak and unable to enjoy the power of God toward his body and spirit. Man was deprived of all things pertaining to life and godliness. How was the death that was present in the time between Adam and Moses removed? How was the sin that was present in the time between Moses and Christ removed? Today, the blood is the answer to these questions. Some have said that the cross is a big plus sign. Although this is man's saying, it is nevertheless true. The cross of God has added everything to us. From Adam to Moses, all we had was death, and from Moses to Christ, all we had was sin. Now the blood of Christ has terminated everything of Adam, including death, and has terminated everything after Moses that was condemned as sin. Now all our failures before God are removed and nothing is left. Through the shedding of the Lord's blood, we do not have to die anymore, and our sins are cleansed. Originally God was for us, and everything that God had was ours. We were separated from God because of sin and, subsequently, death. God could not help us anymore, and His intended blessings and grace were barred from us. Although we can say that through sin we gained death, what actually happened was that through sin, we lost everything that is of God. We lost everything that God had given, can give, and will give to us. The blood apparently only does a direct work of cleansing us from sin. But actually, the blood recovers our relationship with God. Now what God has given, can give, and will give to us can come to us once more in an unhindered way. The blood adds God to us. The blood of Christ not only accomplished redemption, but accomplished an eternal redemption. Unlike the blood of bulls and goats which only accomplished a temporary redemption, the blood of Christ was shed only once and it accomplished an eternal redemption. The blood of Christ is not like the blood of bulls and goats which men in the Old Testament trusted in. The blood of Christ was shed once. Now sin is gone forever, and the conscience no longer condemns us of sins. This is what the blood of Christ has done. It has completely solved, once for all, the problem of sin. Because the problem of sin is solved, God is added to us.</P><P>In the Bible there were two men who covenanted with each other. They were David and Jonathan. David acted according to his covenant with Jonathan. When he found Jonathan's young son, Mephibosheth, among the descendants of Saul, David brought him to his table so that he could eat with him. Mephibosheth thought his life was over and his ancestor's inheritance was lost. When David sent men to look for him, Mephibosheth was trembling in fear. But after David expressed his good intention to him, Mephibosheth realized that his life was no longer in peril. If just his life was preserved, however, he would have regained only the first half of what he had lost. So David called in Ziba and ordered that Saul's possessions be returned to Mephibosheth. In this way Mephibosheth's inheritance was also recovered.</P><P>God wants to give us life, and we have received it. But God also wants to give us our lost inheritance. The shedding of the Lord's blood is not only for the forgiveness of sins. This, by itself, is glorious enough and should be known by all who feel shameful and who hate and abhor their sins. Thank God that more than the problems of death and sin have been solved. The blood of the Lord Jesus has not only dealt with condemnation but has recovered our lost inheritance. The blood has done a wonderful thing: it has added God to us. The blood of the Lord Jesus not only saves us from the recompense of sin; it has redeemed all the inheritance that we have lost in Eden. "The new covenant established in My blood" (Luke 22:20). On the one hand, the Lord's blood was shed for redemption and, on the negative side, removed all the things that harmed us. On the other hand, the blood was shed for the enactment of the new covenant and, on the positive side, bought back our lost inheritance. His blood is not just to redeem, but to buy something back for us. He did not merely redeem us to take care of the problem of sin. He has shed His blood for the purpose of buying back everything that was lost through Adam.</P><P>What is the new covenant? It is an absolutely legal document, established fully according to God's righteous procedures. The new covenant is not God's empty words; it is a document proving that God has bought many things for us through the blood of Jesus Christ.</P><P>Out of concern that you would not understand this, let me bring up one question related to the gospel: what part of our salvation was accomplished through God's righteousness and what part through God's grace? Before the Lord was crucified, everything was done through God's grace. But after the Lord was crucified, everything is done through God's righteousness. What does this mean? It does not mean that there is no grace after the cross. Grace is like the tap water and righteousness is like the water pipe. Grace flows to us through the channel of righteousness; it never flows to us by itself. Concerning this, look at Romans 5:21, "In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Grace reigns through righteousness. God does not give grace to man independently; He gives His grace to man through righteousness. God is merciful to us and does not want us to die. This is why He sent the Lord Jesus to die for us. This is grace. If God did not love us and had not bestowed grace on us, the Lord Jesus would not have come to accomplish redemption for us. But the Lord has died and redemption has been accomplished. When we believe in the Lord for our salvation, is it God's grace or His righteousness that saves us? God's righteousness saves us. The Lord Jesus has died and we have been redeemed; we are no longer condemned. The Lord's death has become our death, and God has accepted the sacrifice we offered in Christ. What we have obtained today is what we should rightfully have. If God does not save us, He would be unrighteous. Before the cross, we could not say that God was unrighteous if He did not save us; all we could say was that God did not love us. But after the Lord Jesus died and redemption was accomplished, if God does not save us, it would not be a matter of God's not loving or giving grace to us but a matter of His being unrighteous and unfaithful.</P><P>Suppose someone owes me fifty dollars and has written a credit note. If he does not pay back his debt, I can force him to pay me back. Even if I have to sue him to get back my money, I cannot be considered unrighteous; I can only be considered as lacking in mercy and love. However, if I give him fifty dollars, and he pays back his debt, I will be unrighteous if I do not tear up the credit note when I receive the money. If I asked him for more money, I would be unrighteous. What is unrighteousness? It is to demand a second payment after a full payment has been made. It is all right if I do not give anything to him. But if I have given him the money, and he has paid the debt, I have to tear up the credit note.</P><P>We cannot say that God does not have grace. If God did not have grace, there would be no new covenant. But if everything that God has given us were based on grace, our faith would not be strong because grace is not very trustworthy. Man often doubts the good intentions of others. However, God does not just have grace; He has manifested His grace in a covenant. In order to give us grace, He bound Himself to a covenant. Grace is expressed in the form of righteousness so that our faith can be strengthened. It is easier to believe in God's righteousness than it is to believe in God's grace and kindness. Consider, for example, the matter of forgiveness. How do we know that our sins are forgiven? The covenant and Word that God has given provides us the assurance. If we see this, we will have more boldness to come to God. We will not ask Him hesitantly like beggars. We have to realize that when we come to God, we can fellowship with Him according to righteousness. Righteousness does not annul grace. On the contrary, it is the highest expression of God's grace. Now, we can boldly take hold of His covenant and ask of Him. He cannot refuse us.</P><P>Do you remember the story of the woman who wiped the feet of Jesus with her hair as she wept continually? The Lord told Simon, "You did not give Me water for My feet, but she, with her tears, has wet My feet...Her sins which are many are forgiven, because she loved much" (Luke 7:44, 47). The Lord's word referred to the forgiveness of the woman's sins. Yet He said this word to Simon and not to the woman directly. While He was saying this, the woman's sins were forgiven. Although the woman heard it, the Lord realized that this was not enough. Her sins were forgiven. But a person's faith may be strong at one time and weak at another time, or he may wonder if his sins are forgiven and doubt his salvation. For this reason, the Lord purposely and explicitly told her, "Your faith has saved you" (v. 50), even though in reality she was already saved. This did not mean that the woman was only saved at the instant of His word. The Lord said this purposely to give her a "handle" to grasp onto. It is not enough to have the fact of salvation; there must also be the word of salvation. Although she was saved, when she received this word, she received the strength to deal with everything, whether Satan's temptations, man's mockings, or her own doubts. She could lay hold of the Lord's word and say to all these things, "The Lord has said that my faith has saved me."</P><P>We have received God's grace, but God established His covenant with us according to His righteousness, so that we can reckon with God and lay hold of His Word. The way of faith is to speak to God and reckon with Him by taking hold of His Word. We are indeed standing on the ground of grace. But we do not receive grace directly; grace does not come to us directly. The blood of Jesus Christ has become the foundation of righteousness; the covenant God made with us can no longer fail. We can now communicate with God on the foundation of righteousness. God loves to see us taking hold of His Word as a handle. He has given us promises based on His facts. One person who was experienced in the Lord said, "God's covenant is God's therapy for unbelief; He uses the covenant to heal the unbelieving ones." In seeking for the forgiveness of sins, before some people consider themselves as being forgiven, they pray until they feel peaceful in their hearts. But what does the Bible tell us? It tells us that we are forgiven by believing in the Word of God. First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." God says that when there is confession, there is forgiveness. Therefore, if we confess our sins, our sins will surely be forgiven. If we believe, we will receive the peace of forgiveness. God says that our duty is to confess and His duty is to forgive. If we do our part, God will do His part. We only have to take care of our part; we do not have to take care of God's part. Mr. Wilkes put it well when he asked, "Will God not do His part when you have done your part?" Therefore, we do not have to worry about our feelings, and we do not have to care about what others say. We do not have to worry about what Satan will inject into our thoughts. All we have to do is to take care of God's Word. As long as we confess, He will forgive. The life of a Christian is nothing other than a life of holding onto God's Word. We believe that God is faithful and righteous, and that whatever He has said will be done. He has said it, and it is so. If we stand fully on the covenant enacted by the Lord's blood, God will care for us and give us everything. God cannot hold back anything from us because He has accepted the blood of the Lord Jesus. God has bound His will in His covenant; He can only operate within the confines of His covenant. Before He made the covenant, He could deal with us as He wished. But after He made the covenant with us, He has only been able to act according to the words in the covenant. God cannot be unrighteous; He has to deal with us in righteousness. He loves us and is merciful to us. He cannot deal with us except in righteousness. No other grace is greater than this! Therefore, where grace is manifested the most, righteousness is also manifested the most.</P><P>The blood of the Lord Jesus is the price of the purchase. The new covenant is the document that proves the purchase, while our faith appropriates what the Lord's blood has purchased. God is pleased to see us labor and build on this field. Suppose you have spent one thousand dollars to buy a piece of land. The money is paid and the grant deed has been transferred to you. You can rule over this land, farm on the land, and build on it. You can rule over this land because you have paid a price for it, not because anyone has granted you a favor. Whatever you have received is what you deserve to receive because you have paid the former owner the price of one thousand dollars. Without the blood of the Lord Jesus, I can honestly say that we do not deserve anything. But because of the blood of the Lord Jesus, we deserve everything. As soon as we receive the blood of the Lord Jesus, we have the right to execute everything contained in God's covenant. What is given to us through the Lord's blood is God's grace. When we ask for God's blessing, based on His covenant and the Lord's blood, and when He blesses us according to His covenant, we are just acting according to righteousness.</P><P>Why does a grant deed need to go through a procedure of being stamped by the government? What is the use of the piece of paper? The little piece of paper comforts our heart. The paper grants us the protection of the government and the protection of the law. God is afraid that our faith is too small to believe in God, and His grace is too bountiful to remember. Therefore, He gave us the new covenant. God is not afraid that He will be unfaithful. This is why He is not afraid to put even the most stringent terms in the covenant. When we claim something according to this covenant, He will surely give it to us.</P><P>In this meeting, we want to know one thing: why is this the age of the new covenant or the New Testament? Today is the age of the new covenant because God has been waiting for His church to rise up and bargain with Him according to His covenant for two thousand years. He has been expecting His church to communicate with Him according to His covenant and demand that He fulfill everything. Brothers and sisters, our faith will be encouraged by speaking to God. He expects to see us speaking to Him in faith. We can lay hold of God's covenant and tell Him, "God, You have to give this to us, and You have to give it to us according to Your righteousness and faithfulness because You have said it in Your covenant." Then we will see fresh grace pouring down from heaven, and we will praise Him because He will fill our mouth with honey. When this happens, we will not need to force a few words of praise out of our mouth during the worship meetings; our mouth will always be filled with "Hallelujahs."</P><P>James said that we do not have because we do not ask, and even if we ask, we do not receive because we would waste what we have (James 4:2-3). But I have to add one more word: we do not receive even when we ask because we do not believe. We do not believe in God's promise, fact, and Word. Soon we will consider the principle of prayer. The principle of prayer is to speak to God by taking hold of the handle in His Word. In the Old Testament, the Lord said in one place that we should ask and command Him (Isa. 45:11). Oh, we can command God!</P><P>You may not know how precious the blood is. If you want to evaluate the value of the blood, do not evaluate according to your understanding. Just say to God, "I do not know the value of the blood, but I ask that You fulfill my requests according to how You value the blood." If you do not pray this way, your prayer and life will be ineffectual. If you lift up the blood before God, you can claim what the covenant has established by the blood. Mr. Andrew Murray said that no one can know all that the blood includes. You cannot fully understand the value of the blood, and you do not have to fully understand. You do not have to see the full value of the blood with your eyes. All you have to do is to say to God, "God, fulfill my prayer according to how You value the blood." You do not have to beg painfully. You can simply pray. Sometimes, you do not even have to pray; you only need to tell God that you want this because it is in His covenant. God will never be unfaithful.</P><P>Therefore, we can see why an unbelieving person will suffer great punishment. Hebrews 10:29 says, "By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?" This kind of person is unsaved; he has despised the blood through which Jesus Christ enacted the covenant. There is no hope for him. He does not believe in the death and redemption of the Lord Jesus and nothing more can be done for him. Apart from the Lord Jesus, he can never find another Savior to redeem him and his end is punishment. However, if we lay hold of God's word, our future will be bright and glorious. The Lord's blood has satisfied God's heart and His demands. God is now standing on our side. All we have to do is believe in His Word. Revelation does not come after faith. First, there is the revelation; then there is the faith to believe in what God has given us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEW COVENANT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(4)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 26</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:28</H1><P>We have seen what a promise is and what a fact is. This morning we will see what God's covenant is. A covenant includes a promise and a fact. Today we will consider in detail what the new covenant includes. God has never established a covenant with the Gentiles. There was no old covenant and no new covenant with them. Before the new covenant, of necessity, there was another covenant that became old; hence, the new covenant. This point relates to biblical knowledge. Originally I had no intention of mentioning this. But, for the sake of helping those who want to study the Bible more and want to understand the origin of the covenant, I have to say something. In the Bible the new covenant is strictly for the Jews, the people of Israel; it is not for the Gentiles. Jeremiah 31:31 says, "Behold, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah." This verse is the first mention in the whole Bible of God's making a new covenant with the Jews. Notice that the covenant was made between God and the house of Israel and the house of Judah. What time does "after those days" in verse 33 refer to? Most people believe that it refers to the beginning of the millennium at the end of the tribulation. They believe that God will not make a new covenant with the Israelites until that time. If this were the case, God has not made a new covenant with us because He has yet to make a new covenant even with the Jews. Please note that only Christ's special grace allows us to participate in the new covenant. The Bible clearly says that when the Lord Jesus died, He shed His blood for the enactment of the new covenant. This blood is the blood of the new covenant. The time for enacting the new covenant between God and the Jews, as mentioned by Jeremiah, will be at the end of the tribulation and the beginning of the kingdom. However, the writer of the book of Hebrews applied Jeremiah's word to us. Matthew 26:28 says that the Lord's blood is the blood of the new covenant, and Hebrews 8:8-13 says that the new covenant belongs to this age. How can we explain this? We have to realize that God made a covenant with Abraham. He did not make a covenant with us. Just as Abraham was justified by faith, we are also justified by faith. Today we can similarly enjoy the future new covenant. We are doing what the Israelites will do in the future. God has put us under the blessing of the new covenant today.</P><P>In Romans Paul told us that a man, through faith, could participate in the covenant God made with Abraham. The same principle applies in obtaining the covenant that God will make with the Jews. As long as we follow the footsteps of Abraham, we will receive the covenant that God gave to Abraham. As long as we trust in the same thing that the Israelites, in the future, will trust in, we will receive the future covenant. Zechariah says that the people of Israel will one day come, believe, and acknowledge Jesus as their Savior, not just as their Messiah. If we believe in the Lord Jesus, as the Jews will believe in the future, God will put us in His new covenant. If we believe what Abraham believed, we will receive Abraham's blessing. If we believe now what the Israelites will believe in the future, we will receive what the Jews will receive in the future.</P><P>We can see clearly that the time for realizing the new covenant is in the future at the beginning of the millennium. Through the Lord Jesus' death for us, we now have a foretaste of the blessing of the new covenant. There is no doubt about this. We need to pay attention to what the new covenant is. From the time God spoke about enacting the new covenant through Jeremiah to the time the Lord Jesus established the new covenant, how many years were there? The time span was very long; it was a few hundred years. During these few hundred years, the new covenant was just dead letters. It is a pity that many Jews did not receive the blessing of the new covenant. Although God's covenant was written out, placed before them, and they had read about God's making a new covenant with the people of Israel, they did not know how they could obtain this new covenant, nor did they receive the blessings of the new covenant. Thank the Lord that He did not mention a covenant throughout most of His lifetime. He did not speak of a covenant. All He did was cast out demons, heal the sick, feed men by multiplying loaves, and preach the gospel. Our Lord worked quietly, day after day and year after year. Then one night, when He was alone with a few disciples at dinner, He suddenly brought up a covenant which was very old, buried, concealed, and completely forgotten, but was still very precious, reliable, and signed. It was a covenant that had never been used or claimed by anyone. Suddenly the Lord declared that the cup was His blood, which was shed for the new covenant. From the time He came to the earth to the time He died, the central thought occupying the Lord Jesus was enacting the covenant. But until that night He had not explicitly mentioned that He was going to fulfill this covenant. He said then that the blood He was to shed was for the enactment of the new covenant.</P><P>Today man has forgotten the full gospel. Most people say that the Lord Jesus shed His blood to redeem man from sin. Truly, the blood of the Lord was shed for redemption. But at the same time, it was also shed for the enactment of the new covenant. If the Lord had not died and His blood had not been shed, the new covenant would not have been accomplished, and God could not have made a covenant with us. Truly, the Lord shed His blood for redemption. But redemption is not the final goal of the shedding of His blood. Redemption is only a means and a way to reach the final goal. The final goal is the enactment of the new covenant and the bestowal of the blessing of the new covenant on us. Our sins are forgiven through the blood of the Lord, but the purpose of His shedding the blood was for the enactment of the new covenant. We know that without the shedding of blood, there is no redemption. Hebrews 9:22 says that without shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness. Redemption and the enactment of the covenant are very intimate and closely related. However, there is a distinction between the two. Brothers and sisters, please remember that God made a covenant to give us knowledge, life, and power. Because our sins are not yet cleansed, we do not receive them. Sin lies between us and God, and separates us from the knowledge, life, and power that God wants to give us. All of our sins before God must be removed. The way to remove the sins before God is not by our work, merit, or future improvement. If our sins are not dealt with and removed before God, He cannot forgive our sins. Thank the Lord that He has been crucified for our sins; He has shed His blood, has resurrected from the tomb, and ascended to God. God is fully satisfied in His death and resurrection. Therefore, He must forgive us.</P><P>The only one way for our sins to be forgiven is for us to be cleansed righteously in the Lord's blood. However, when sinners want to be saved, they will try any method, whether righteous or not. Before we were awakened and before we repented, we refused salvation. But when we realized the result of sin, the danger of our present position, and the pain and terror of eternal punishment in hell, we tried many methods to be saved. However, with God, there cannot be many methods. God's way of salvation must not conflict with His righteousness, holiness, nature, and will. At the time we were saved, we were filthy and sinful persons; we did not know God's holy, righteous, and glorious salvation. God's salvation must not come into conflict with His righteousness, holiness, and glory, and, at the same time, still save sinners. We did not know and we did not care about these things because we were short of the glory of God anyway. Romans 3 through 5 say that the Lord was delivered and crucified for our sins and resurrected for our righteousness. Since we were so sinful, filthy, and hopeless, we were very short of God's glory. But when the Lord died and resurrected, He recovered God's glory.</P><P>God did not forgive our sins in a careless and foolish way. He did not forgive our unrighteousness in a loose way. He cannot deal with sin carelessly and loosely. God has judged and punished the sinners in the Lord Jesus. We have passed through God's judgment and punishment in the Lord, and we are saved through the Lord. Our sins have not been forgiven in a careless and loose way. Rather, we passed through God's judgment and punishment in Christ.</P><P>When I was in Shanghai, I met a friend who was a lawyer and also a Christian, and I asked how he was saved. He told me that after he heard a message, he realized that the doctrine of salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus was very lawful. According to the law, when man transgresses the law, he must be judged by the court and punished by the government. After he has been judged and punished, he is no longer a sinner. If a criminal commits a crime and deserves to be punished ten years in prison and then is imprisoned for ten years, when he comes out of prison, he is no longer guilty of any crime. No one can put him into prison for another ten years. Even if his adversary meets him on the street, the adversary cannot do anything to him because he is no longer a criminal. Originally, we were all great sinners, but we were judged and punished by God. We do not have our sins anymore, and no one can say anything against us.</P><P>God's way of salvation must be able to save us according to His righteous demands and must allow the conscience to approve it. In the past we did not know that the way God saves sinners is in accordance with His righteousness and holiness. We did not know that sin had to pass through severe judgment and punishment. God is absolutely holy and righteous. His eyes cannot behold sin. Because the Lord died for us and resurrected, the blood He shed satisfies God's heart. When the holy and righteous God saw this death, He considered it our death and passed over us. He had nothing more to say about us. The holy and righteous God said, "This is enough. It is all right." Even more, we can say, "It is enough. It is all right."</P><P>God cares for His holy nature and righteous way more than we do. He cannot do anything contrary to His virtuous nature. He has to act according to His nature in righteousness, holiness, and glory. Otherwise, He is not qualified to save the sinners. The Lord's blood is precious because it satisfies the righteous and holy God. This is why the sinners can be saved and become sinless, righteous ones. When God enacted the new covenant, our sins were removed once and for all. When the Lord saves us, He eternally saves us to the uttermost. When God accepted the sacrifice of the Lord, our filth, rubbish, and everything that blocked God's way was removed, and we were accepted by God.</P><P>The blood of the new covenant not only removed the hindrances, it also bought back something. It bought back an inheritance for us. The Bible speaks of the Lord's work of salvation; it also speaks of His bringing us back to the Father's house and His kingdom, and of His giving us an eternal inheritance kept in the heavens. He has not just saved us as poor individuals. When we consider the blood, we should see that it has not only removed something, it has also bought us something. The blood enables us to draw nigh to God. God has not brought us just to the outer court. He has not just told us to go in peace and that our sins have been forgiven. He has brought us through the veil into His habitation and removed the separating veil. Not only have our iniquities and unrighteousness been removed and cleansed, but God has given Himself to us to be our all. Therefore, whatever He can do, we can do also. The blood is a big plus; it has added everything to us. Paul said that if God "did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?" (Rom. 8:32).</P><P>The blood of the Son of God not only redeemed us, but purchased an inheritance for us who believe in the name of His Son. I hope that whoever is sitting here today would lift up their hearts to God and say to Him, "Thank You, the blood has removed everything that is against me." If you can say this to God, I will thank the Lord for you. The blood has not only removed your sin and hindrances before God, it has also put you in a covenant. Through the blood, God has now given you everything in the covenant.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, do you know that a covenant is most effective? If you do not know God's covenant and only pray according to your own will, you will not obtain what you want. You will not even have the power to ask for what you want. When you see the effectiveness of the blood, when you see all the spiritual blessings in the heavenlies that it has bought for you, when you see all the things pertaining to life and godliness, and when you see that all these things are yours, you will realize that it is foolish to painfully beg for God's work to be accomplished. If I go to the Shanghai Bank today and say, "I am very poor. Please give me fifty dollars," I could beg from eight in the morning until eight at night, but I do not think that I will receive fifty dollars. It is difficult to receive by begging in this way. But if I deposit some money there, do I still have to beg? All I have to do is claim it. There is no need for me to pitifully beg. If the banker pays me too slowly, I can even ask him to hurry up. In one instance, I do not have money in the bank, and I can only beg. In the other instance, I have money, and I can claim it. In the former case, the bank's money has nothing to do with me. In the latter case, it is my own money. Brothers and sisters, have you seen what a covenant is? Have you seen what a vain request that has no basis is and what a request that is based on a covenant is? The covenant is a document that shows that the Lord has bought all things pertaining to life and godliness for us with His blood. When we ask according to the covenant, we are not asking for something that is not ours; we are claiming what is ours and has been kept in custody. A request based on the covenant is not an empty request, but a claim for what has been promised in the covenant. Before the Lord died, there was a need to ask and pray. But since the Lord has died on the cross, do we still need to ask and pray, or should we claim what is ours? We should realize that now all of the spiritual blessings are ours, and all we have to do is to claim and apply them. God is now standing on our side because of the blood. We can obtain all the blessings through the blood. Many times, through the blood, we can come to God and claim rather than ask. This does not mean that we do not need to pray, but our prayers should be more of a claim than a request. Mr. Gordon said that since Golgotha, all the references to asking in the Bible should be changed to taking. Everyone who knows God, who knows Golgotha, and who knows the meaning of the blood will say "amen" to this word. The blood shed on the cross on Golgotha has purchased all the spiritual blessings concerning life and godliness for us. Now everything is being kept for us, and all that we have to do is claim them back. Through the blood, we do not have to ask God to give us what He has, but what we have. This is why we say that God is now dealing with us according to the principle of righteousness and not grace. Everything that the new covenant gives to us is according to righteousness and is rightfully ours. We can claim all these things through the new covenant.</P><P>We need to consider specifically what the new covenant is and what the difference is between the blood and the covenant. The new covenant is nothing other than a written document that lists the inheritance purchased by the Lord's blood. This document is signed by God Himself, and it acknowledges that all the inheritance purchased by the Lord Jesus is ours. We have gained the new covenant with the price of the blood. This document is bought with the price of blood. One gets as much as he pays for. The new covenant includes all that the blood has purchased.</P><P>What has the Lord's blood purchased? The Lord's blood has redeemed us. But whatever has been recorded in the new covenant has also been purchased by the Lord's blood. Among the many things, three are very precious. Later, we will consider them in detail. Man does not know how to speak to God according to the record of the covenant because he does not know the rights that the blood has granted him. He does not realize that he can speak to God according to the letter of the covenant. Based on the fact that God has made the covenant with him, all the spiritual blessings are his.</P><P>Do you know about the first covenant God made with man? Let me tell you about the first covenant God made with man. According to my study of the Bible, the first record of God's making a covenant with man was at the time of Noah. Before Noah, God had never made a covenant with man. The earliest record of covenant-making was God's making a covenant with Noah. In the story of God's covenant with Noah, the most difficult thing for God to do was to make man understand His will. God has tried His best to speak to us in different ages and in many ways through the prophets concerning His will for us. He truly wants us to know His will. But when we do not have a covenant, we are not clear about God's will, we do not have much assurance, and we do not know how to pray.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, do you realize that man is prone to doubt God's promises? During the meeting here, you surely think that you have faith. But when you are alone and destitute, when you are by yourself with no one helping or comforting you, what about your faith? When you are in extreme poverty and helplessness, when you are depleted of any financial means, you will see how hard it is to believe that God will supply your need. When you are seriously ill, and the doctor says that you are about to die, your heart may say, "How do I know if my prayer will help me?" You may think that you have to earnestly pray many times before God might heal you. After you pray this way, you may not know how to believe, and you may even feel that you can no longer believe in God. This is why many people do not pray at ordinary times. They think that it does not make any difference whether or not they pray, and that either way they will live. They will live if they pray, and they will live if they do not pray. They have no desire to know God's will. They realize how precious it is to understand God's will concerning a matter only when the bridge is broken and the way has disappeared before them. When they find that no one can tell them anything, they begin to pray to God and to try to understand God's will concerning a certain matter. When they encounter difficulties, the devil will put all kinds of doubts in their heart and say to them, "You have been so defiled and committed so many sins. You have been so terrible. Will God hear your prayers now? Are you not ashamed? Do you still have the boldness to ask God for help?" Not only will the devil tempt you, but your flesh will be weakened, and you will begin to doubt God in many ways. "How can God answer the prayer of men like me? How can He answer my prayers?" God already knows the smallness of your faith. That is why He only asks that you have faith like a mustard seed. He does not ask for greater faith, for He knows that you will never have greater faith. The mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds. As long as your faith is as great as the smallest seed, you will be all right. God knows that your heart is small. This is why He gives all kinds of promises to you, so that you will believe in Him. No one ever has great faith. God cannot make you believe. For this reason He has covenants with man. If you understand a covenant, you will realize that God does not require you to be perfect and has not rebuked you; He knows that you are short, and He sympathizes with your weaknesses. He sympathizes with the fact that your faith cannot match His position. He knows that your faith is too small and cannot climb over the high wall to reach Him. So He lowered Himself to covenant with man. The covenant is initiated by God and ordained by God. God gives it to us because He sympathizes with our weakness. God gives us a covenant so that we can have a means by which we can believe in Him.</P><P>At the time of Noah, man had greatly sinned and was filled with iniquities. God sent the flood to destroy them because of the great sins and iniquities. All of the living creatures, including man and animals, were destroyed by the flood. Only Noah's household of eight, together with the animals that they brought into the ark, were preserved. The people who were not destroyed by the flood could have been extremely apprehensive that a flood would once more come and destroy the world if they committed some sins again, and that there might not be another ark, and that no one could preserve the eight of them. They were kept in the ark for a year. During this time they did not see any land or people. Day and night, all they saw was a great span of water, and all they heard was the sound of water. Later when the water subsided, they began to dwell in an uninhabited lonely wilderness. They did not know if they would have to face another devastating deluge again. They did not know God's will concerning this matter. They did not know that God would not destroy the world with a flood again, keep them from hunger and thirst, cause the earth to produce food, and ensure that they lived without peril and in peace. God knew that it was difficult for man to understand His good intention; therefore, He gave man something to hold onto. He made a covenant with Noah: "And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; and with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth" (Gen. 9:8-17). God made a covenant with Noah because when Noah's household came out of the ark, their past experience would inevitably cause them to worry about their future. God was concerned that they would not believe that God would protect them from another destroying flood. As a result, He made a covenant with them so that they could believe. When Noah took hold of the words of this covenant, he was at peace and did not have to be afraid. Once he had the covenant, he could believe in God and rest in the covenant. This is the use of a covenant. Man does not know or understand God's will. God has to give man a covenant so that man will have something to hold onto. We know God's will through the covenant.</P><P>The history of God's dealing with man is almost the same as the history of His covenants with man. God has put man into the covenants. He put Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, and all past and present believers into the covenants. The whole Bible is the covenants of God. All the blessings that God gave to Noah, Abraham, David, etc., are all contained in the covenants. He has put all the blessings to the Jews and to the present-day believers into the covenants. In this way man will no longer doubt Him, but believe in His Word. God is willing to be bound and lose His freedom by entering into covenants with man because of our weakness and unbelief. All that we need to do is ask and enjoy according to the deed of the covenant.</P><P>After Solomon completed the building of the temple, he realized that God had made a covenant with his father David, and he prayed that God would accomplish the words He promised with His own mouth. Solomon took hold of the word that God had provided and asked God to accomplish what He had promised. Now, we have the new covenant that God has established with us. What should we do? All we have to do is ask God to fulfill in us what He has promised according to the covenant. God is great, infinite, and seemingly untouchable. We dare not draw near to Him and do not know how to pray to Him because He is so great. Therefore, He has limited Himself to the covenants, so that we can draw near to Him, pray to Him, claim from Him, and speak to Him according to the covenant.</P><P>Only when we know the greatness and riches of the new covenant will we realize the vastness of God's love and grace. Without the covenants, how could we bargain with God and speak to Him according to the words of the covenants? If God has not been gracious to us, how can there be the covenants? If only we will have a small, feeble, and weak faith, it will be like the little candlelight that flickers before the wind. But we can lay hold of God's handle in His Word, and God will answer us and fulfill all our needs.</P><P>Remember the word in the book of Isaiah which says, "Put Me [God] in remembrance" (Isa. 43:26). This seems to indicate that, like us, God tends to forget; we have to remind Him, so that He will remember. When we pray and have not received, we should remind God saying, "Have You forgotten the covenant You made with me? Please give according to what You have said." If you do this, you will surely receive. (This word is only to those who know the Lord in a deep way.)</P><P>What should we do? Hebrews 13:20-21 says, "Now the God of peace, He who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant, perfect you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen." This is a written prayer of a believer, one of the greatest prayers in the whole Bible. It says that God will do in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ. What a great prayer this is! He asks God "in the blood of an eternal covenant." He stands upon the eternal covenant of God and asks God, according to the covenant which He made when He brought up the Lord Jesus from the dead, that the Lord Jesus would live in us, and that we can do the things that are well pleasing to God. A great prayer is none other than a request that is based on the eternal covenant which was established by the shedding of the Lord's blood. We should have the faith which allows us to stand on the covenant and prays by clinging to the covenant. Based on the covenant, we should say to God, "God, I am now praying to You according to the handle that I lay hold of in Your Word." This kind of prayer is powerful and effective. If we believe in the covenant, we will be strengthened and emboldened to pray to God.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, what kind of prayers are based on the covenant? The prayer by the writer of Hebrews is one of these prayers. There are many other prayers in the Bible like this one. Unfortunately, no one today prays to God according to the letter of the covenant, and no one asks God to give to him the riches promised in Christ so that he can glorify God.</P><P>Finally, remember that you have the firm right to pray to God according to the covenant. You can ask God to act according to the covenant. You can say to God, "You have covenanted with me. Please accomplish for me according to the covenant." I have to repeat again that without faith, you can pray all you want and nothing will happen. God can only do so much. Suppose a friend says to you, "I have deposited a great deal of money in the bank in your name. Here is the check. Whenever you want the money, just sign your name and withdraw the money from the bank." If you do not move your hand to sign the check, you will not get the money. The blame will be on you. God can only cause the Lord Jesus to come to earth, be crucified, shed His blood to enact the new covenant, and allow you to bargain with Him according to this covenant. If you do not exercise your faith to claim and apply, these things will not have any effect on you. I can frankly say that many believers do not have any faith at all. Not only are backsliding and cold believers lacking in faith, even Christians whom others consider to be very zealous are also lacking in faith. They all pray according to their own feelings. They think that as long as they repent and do good, God will surely answer their prayers. Some think that as long as they promise God that they will repent and try their best to be good and proper Christians, God will answer their prayers.</P><P>Today we have seen the basis of the new covenant. May we rise up and exercise our faith to lay hold of all these riches. Tomorrow, we will speak on the sphere and contents of the new covenant. We will also speak on the three main parts of the new covenant.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEW COVENANT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(5)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 32</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:28; Heb. 8:6-12</H1><P>We have previously seen that God is a God who makes covenants with man. We have also seen that instead of uplifting Himself to an untouchable position, God has lowered Himself to our position, so that we can enjoy the same rights as He has. We see that God has uplifted us. He has allowed us to deal with Him and ask of Him according to the covenant. God allows us to demand that He execute everything for us. Since this is the case, we can rise up and exercise our faith to hold onto God.</P><P>We have seen that in the original language, a covenant is both a covenant as well as a testament or a will. Covenant and will are the same word in the original language. Hebrews uses the word covenant many times. It first tells us that Christ is higher than the prophets, angels, Moses, Joshua, and Aaron. All this is very wonderful. But this is not the goal of the book. These teachings are indeed in Hebrews, and Bible expositors have done a commendable job on expounding them. But we see that Hebrews has one specific goal: to put the new covenant before us. This is repeatedly emphasized from chapter six to thirteen. Although this book mentions the blood, Aaron, Moses, and the sacrifices, all these things are mentioned in relation to the covenant. The goal of chapters six through thirteen is to tell us what the new covenant is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE COVENANT<br>AND THE TESTAMENT</H2><P>Who is the One who made the new covenant with us? Is it the Lord or is it God? It is God, not the Lord. The Lord Jesus shed His blood to accomplish the new covenant. But the One who made the covenant with us is God. He is the other party. Why is the covenant also a testament? The covenant is something that God has made and, therefore, is a covenant. The covenant is something that the Lord Jesus left to us at His death and, therefore, is a will. A covenant does not require the maker to die before it becomes effective, but a testament requires the testator to die before it becomes effective. It is universally agreed that when a man is still alive, his testament will not be put into effect. Therefore, we see that God made a covenant with us, while the death of the Lord Jesus has left us the testament. On the one hand, the Lord has redeemed the inheritance with His blood. On the other hand, He has left us the new covenant as our inheritance.</P><P>Hebrews 9:15-17 says, "And because of this He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established. For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living."</P><P>Hebrews 10:16-17 says, "`This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws upon their hearts, and upon their mind I will inscribe them,' He then says, `And their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall by no means remember anymore.'"</P><P>Please note that Hebrews 8 tells us that God has made a new covenant. He said, "I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them..for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them" (vv. 10-11). Chapter ten is merely a reiteration of the words of chapter eight.</P><P>Chapter nine tells us that the Lord Jesus Christ is "the Mediator of a new covenant." A more accurate translation should be "the Executor of a new covenant." The Lord is the One who executes the new covenant. Verse 10:16 says that God is the One who has covenanted the new covenant. As far as the new covenant is concerned, God is the Maker of the covenant, while as far as a testament is concerned, Christ is the Mediator. Now we will list the items included in the new covenant:</P><P>(1) Cleansing <b>}</b>	Salvation<br>(2) Knowledge <b>}</b> Victory<br>(3) Life and power <b>}</b> Victory</P><P>The covenant includes three main parts. Cleansing is in respect to sin. Knowledge is in respect to the knowledge of God, and life and power are in respect to victory. As far as making a covenant with us is concerned, God cleanses us, God grants the knowledge of God to us, and God gives us life and power. As far as a testament is concerned, Christ has willed cleansing to us, and Christ has willed the knowledge of God to us, and Christ has willed life and power to us.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, what are the similarities between a covenant and a testament? What we have received from the covenant and testament is the same. But as far as God is concerned, they are different. With respect to our relationship with God, it is a covenant; with respect to our relationship with the Lord, it is not a covenant, but a testament. The Lord, however, is also the Executor of this testament. Since it is a testament, it is not effective until the Testator has died. This is why chapter nine emphasized the blood of the covenant. The Lord Jesus has brought the blood into the Holy of Holies. This shows that the Testator has died. In this way, God knows that the Testator has died and we know it also. On the night of His betrayal, the Lord Jesus lifted up the cup and the bread, as a sign that we should remember His death. Paul explained the same thing to us. He said that the purpose of the cup and the bread is to declare His death. We can declare that the Lord has died and that the testament has come into effect.</P><P>Yesterday we mentioned that the new covenant was mentioned in Jeremiah's time. Even though there was a covenant during those five or six hundred years, it had no effect. This is like a man leaving his will in the safe or with a lawyer. The will is not effective until the man dies; only then will the items mentioned in the will become available to others. Before a testator dies, the testament is just a useless piece of paper. But one day, the Lord suddenly said, "Take, eat; this is My body...Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant" (Matt. 26:26-28). By this word we can receive the testament. The greatest and most glorious covenant was there for five or six hundred years. Now it is ours. Brothers and sisters, I am not trying to delay telling you about the content of the new covenant; I am trying to show you what the new covenant is. The new covenant is the Lord's testament; it is the Lord's inheritance. We can know God without anyone teaching us, and we can have the power to do God's will and please Him. These are the things that God's new covenant and the Lord's testament have left to us.</P><P>For a testament, there is not only the crucial need for a witness, but more importantly there is the need for someone who will execute the testament. Many times, the executors of testaments cheat. We sometimes find lawyers, serving as executors, who cheat. Thank God that the One who made the testament is the Lord, and the One who executes the testament is also the Lord. As far as His death is concerned, the Lord Jesus is the One who made the testament. As far as His resurrection is concerned, He is also the One who executes the testament. He has given us the most precious and best blessings. He has given us salvation and victory. Although the new covenant seems to include only these three items, all the needs and demands of a Christian are included in these three things. Thank God that the Lord has brought the blood into the Holy of Holies and has told us that the Testator has died. As the High Priest, He has become the Mediator of the new covenant in heaven.</P><P>Hebrews 12:22-24 says, "But you have come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, to the universal gathering; and to the church of the firstborn, who have been enrolled in the heavens; and to God, the Judge of all; and to the spirits of righteous men who have been made perfect; and to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks something better than that of Abel." Here it tells us that we have not come to Mount Sinai, but Mount Zion, which is the gathering place for God, the angels, the resurrected righteous ones, and the firstborn. But this is also where the Lord Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, is. From this, we see that the Lord is the Mediator of the new covenant in heaven. He is not only the High Priest, but He is also the Mediator, an eternal Mediator. He lives forever and causes the new covenant to become effective in us. He will see the result of His work of shedding the blood: we will know God, no one will have to teach us, and we will have the life and power to obey God. He has become the Mediator for this purpose. As far as God's faithfulness and righteousness are concerned, this covenant can never be repealed or annulled. As far as Christ's resurrection power is concerned, this covenant is forever effective.</P><P>The Lord Jesus Christ is the One who has made the testament. In His testament, He has left us an inheritance. Receiving something from the testament means having something which we did not have before. We receive it without labor and work. It is something given to us by Him. This is what it means to inherit the new covenant. Many people have many foolish thoughts. A sinner often thinks that after he has sinned, he has to try his best to do good until his sins are forgiven. I do not know how many years he will wait before he thinks his sins will be forgiven. Others think that after they have sinned, they should pray until they feel peaceful. Then they think that they are forgiven. Friends, this is what they do, but this is not what the testament gives to them.</P><P>Paul said one word that was quite meaningful. He said that, humanly speaking, children should not store up for the parents, but the parents for the children (2 Cor. 12:14b). A testament is something that others leave to us; we are only enjoying the labor of others. We only need to sit quietly and enjoy; there is no need to labor and work. We can inherit what others have done.</P><P>Many people have asked me how they can know God's will, and why they do not know God's will. Perhaps among us there are some who have similar questions. I wrote in my magazine that a Christian can distinguish God's will like a man can distinguish tares from wheat. After a believer read the magazine, he wrote to me and said that he could not distinguish God's will in a way similar to distinguishing tares from wheat. What enables us to distinguish God's will is a kind of spiritual knowledge. This knowledge causes us to know God's will without any effort or vain attempts. This knowledge is willed to us by the Lord Jesus' testament. It is within us and causes us to know God's will. Therefore, every Christian should know God's will, and every Christian can know God's will. No Christian can deny this.</P><P>Some Christians say, "It is doctrinally correct that the Bible says this. But after I heard such a word, I was still as weak as ever. Every time temptations came, I failed, and I am still not victorious." Everyone who has experienced Romans 7 knows how weak they are. All those who do not know God's power have no power in themselves to overcome the power of the world and the power within them which is the power of Satan. Brothers and sisters, the way is not by thinking about what to do. Thank God that with the Lord, there is a testament. We do not have to labor and strive before we can receive; everything has been freely given to us.</P><P>The executor of a testament is the one who is responsible for the effectiveness of the testament. Every item of the testament is our rightful portion. If the executor is faithful, every item of the testament will be ours. Only if the executor is not faithful will we fail to receive an item. It is impossible for us not to receive all the items of the testament because the Lord Jesus is the faithful Executor. What we should receive are cleansing, life, and power. These three things include every need in our spiritual life. The Lord Jesus died and resurrected for us. He not only left His testament, but He became the faithful Executor of the testament. Therefore, we should no longer live a poor, dry, and powerless life. We should rise up and run, exercising our faith to receive all that the testament has promised.</P><P>Since one baptism is enough for a Christian, why must the breaking of the bread for the remembrance of the Lord be done again and again? Why did the breaking of bread occur every Lord's Day in the church at the time of the apostles? The answer to both questions is that the cup is the cup of the new covenant which, every Lord's Day, reminds us that the Christian standing is based on a covenanted relationship. The blood speaks of God's grace, while the cup speaks of God's righteousness. The cup is the cup of the covenant. Every Lord's Day we call to memory the new covenant, and every time we remember the cup, we receive all that this cup contains. The Lord said that we have to drink this cup because it is the cup of His covenant. Therefore, we should not merely see the physical grape juice. This is the cup of the covenant. The Lord wants us to drink until we are full and satisfied. We should drink all that He has given to us. The Lord wants us to remember that He is bound by the covenant. He is happy to give us everything according to the promise in the covenant. He wants us to always remember that we can enjoy forever all of the things in the new covenant. Every time we remember the Lord before God, He shows us these things. The bread is to remember the Lord, and the cup is also to remember the Lord. The Lord deals with us according to the condition stipulated in the covenant. Therefore, every time we remember the Lord, we remember Him in the covenant. Do you want to be filled with the Holy Spirit? Do you want to know God's will? Do you want to be cleansed? These are all easy to achieve.</P><P>Hebrews 8:10-12 mentions three things: (1) God will impart His laws into our mind and inscribe them on our hearts; He will be God to us, and we will be a people to Him. (2) We will not teach our fellow citizen and brother by saying, "Know the Lord." All will know Him from the little one to the great one among us. (3) He will be propitious to our unrighteousnesses and will not remember our sins anymore.</P><P>We can see that the new covenant includes three distinctive areas: (1) God has given us the power of the new life so that we can have the strength to do God's will. (2) We can now do what we could not do as brothers and neighbors. (3) God gives knowledge to us according to the new covenant so that we will realize that His death is our death and that His punishment is our punishment. When we believe in Him, we are saved.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we are forgiven and cleansed of our sins; they are not merely forgotten. Our sins are forgiven; they are not cleansed by time or by forgetting about them. We can forget sin for a while, but the conscience does not die; it only sleeps. One day our conscience will wake up and condemn us again. Our conscience will not be at peace forever. However, God has caused the Lord Jesus to die, and the problem of our sins is solved. The problem of our sins is forever solved before God. God caused the Lord Jesus to die in order that our sins may be forgiven and our unrighteousness cleansed.</P><P>This is not all. At the same time, He put us into a new position and into a new home so that we can begin to serve God. When we begin to serve God, we will feel that this is wrong and that is not right. If we think that we do not know how to serve God and deal with God, we will suffer much. We will think that had we known God's will earlier, we would not have made this and that mistake. If we do not have knowledge from God, we will be tossed in sorrow day and night. But let me say that God has not only forgiven our sins, but has given us the knowledge to know Him so that we can know God's will and God's heart. We are not those who merely know God's will, but those who know God's heart. The meaning of this is very profound. It means that we do not have to ask God before we can make judgments and discernments according to God's judgments and discernments. Some brothers and sisters can understand God's will. But the new covenant is not limited to this; it allows us to know God's heart and to judge and discern based on His heart.</P><P>But let me say this: it is one thing to know God's will and God's heart. It is another thing to be able to do them. We must not only know where we should go. We must also have the power to go there. Within the new covenant, God has given us the power. He has not only given us knowledge, but also the power to carry out God's will. Brothers and sisters, since this is the case, what more can we ask? If we have this, we have to say that we are satisfied. If we are forgiven and cleansed, and have received the knowledge, life, and power, we are satisfied before God. We must know that God has only given us one new covenant; He has given us nothing else. God is supplying us and filling us with this one thing.</P><P>The first item in the new covenant is cleansing. This has to do with salvation. The second item is knowledge. This has to do with our understanding of God. The third thing is life and power. This has to do with our victory. If the first item is reliable, then the second and third items must also be reliable. Why have so many people received the first item and so few received the second and third items? A believer can receive all three items at the same time. There is no need for receiving at different times, and there is no need to seek God a second time to obtain these. Whoever will rise up today and cling to God by faith, saying, "God, Your covenant has said that I can know God, understand God, and know Your method. I can know God's heart, God's nature, and God's way." This knowledge is not the knowledge that we ordinarily speak about. Rather, the eternal life enables us to know God. This knowledge has no distinction of age. Not only can the young ones know God, but the older ones can know Him as well. If we have knowledge, life, and power, they will be useless if we are not cleansed. That is why there is the forgiveness of sins. However, this does not mean that when we receive the new covenant, we experience these things in three different stages.</P><P>Many people consider salvation and victory to be two different stages. Actually, there is no need to divide salvation and victory into two different stages; we do not need a second work of God's grace before we can overcome. Salvation, victory, and power can be received at the same time. Because some people's lives are sick, they need a second work of God's grace. Paul did not have a second experience; he was filled with the Holy Spirit from the beginning. Not every saved person can be as mature as a faithful and experienced believer immediately. A Christian needs to grow, but growth does not mean that cleansing, receiving life and power, and receiving knowledge have to be in different stages.</P><P>Young Christians cannot be as experienced as those who are faithful in the Lord and who have followed the Lord for twenty or thirty years. But neither should they be in a condition of failure like many Christians today. How many Christians today listen to the inner voice and know how to be led by God? How many can do the right thing without the need for others to teach them? Many people need others to tell them what they should do and should not do, or else they will make mistakes. Some people are very loving, patient, and good. But they need someone to be their head. In everything, they ask others what to do. How many can go on according to the Bible and the inner leading, without asking others what to do? How many have received the truth, power, life, knowledge, and cleansing that are contained in the new covenant?</P><P>How many among us are powerful? We know that power does not come from us. As soon as temptation comes, we fail. We all know that we are weak; our hearts melt as water (Josh. 7:5), and we cannot overcome. But in the new covenant, there are wonderful provisions. The new covenant meets our needs. No one needs to add anything to it or take anything from it. God has done a perfect job; it cannot be more perfect. This is what every Christian ought to receive. God saves a Christian and gives him three things so that he can live without want for the rest of his life.</P><P>Before we were saved, we considered what we should do about our sins and what we should do when our conscience was not at peace. We wondered what would happen if we repented. When we heard that God would forgive all of our unrighteousness and forgive our sins, we wondered about His willingness and ability to forgive. We did not realize that God sent the Lord Jesus to the earth to save us, that His covenant confirmed it, and that we did not have to wait any longer. Now we can realize the glory within God's new covenant. With the new covenant, there is the cleansing, knowledge, and power. However, those who do not have faith will remain unchanged.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEW COVENANT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(6)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 33</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:28; Heb. 8:10-12</H1><P>This morning we saw the items included in the new covenant. We have spoken only three things during the past three days: God's promise, His fact, and His covenant. This morning we saw that the first item of the new covenant is the forgiveness of sin, cleansing, and anointing. The second item we saw was that God's anointing allows man to know God directly and that there is no need for anyone to be taught by his neighbors, brothers and sisters, or parents. We can fellowship with God and speak to God according to the covenant, and there is no need for anyone else to teach us or instruct us. The third item we saw was that the indwelling Holy Spirit enables us to do what is pleasing to God. It enables us to have the new life which walks and acts for us and within us. We will come to this later. This afternoon we will consider how our sins are forgiven according to the covenant. We will review what we may have forgotten, including what God has done for the saved ones and the things that we have received. Some time ago our Bible study covered the two aspects of sin, which are our sins before God and the sin within man. However, many new ones among us do not understand this difference. For this reason, we have to say something about this again.</P><P>According to the Bible, there are two aspects to sin. The first is the record of sin before God. Every sin before God demands a punishment. The second is the sin within us which is a master that lords over us. This master of sin dominates us. In regard to sin, there is a distinction between the sin in man and the sin before God. The sin in the conscience is different from the sin in the heart. The sin before the law is different from the sin in our living. The sin before God is different from the sin within us. The sins before God are the record of sin before Him; they cause us to have no peace while living on earth. The sin within us is the power that rules over us. Most unsaved people have no peace when they think of the sins they have before God. When they are touched by the Holy Spirit, their conscience cries out, and they realize that they are condemned sinners before God. The once dormant conscience is then awakened. When they consider the coming judgment, the punishment which they deserve, and eternal pain in hell, they tremble and wish that their record of sin could be immediately removed.</P><P>Most of us sitting here today have received the Lord Jesus as our Savior. While we were hopeless and helpless, the gospel was preached to us: the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross. He shed His blood to forgive and cleanse us from our sins, and He suffered the judgment and punishment which we deserved. He has fully borne the burden of our sins. His death has become our death, and His shedding of blood has become our shedding of blood. When He suffered God's judgment and punishment of wrath, we were also brought to the cross and passed through God's judgment of wrath. His death has saved us. Now we can pray and thank God, for He has full salvation. We have been saved through the Lord Jesus; we have been cleansed of our sins and forgiven, and we do not have to suffer any punishment anymore. Since the day we were saved, we have felt that the burden of our sin has been lifted. Our transgressions have been forgiven and we have been cleansed. We are no longer just sinners, but saved persons who have received God's grace. We have the Holy Spirit within us, and spontaneously we cry, "Abba, Father!" We have a life union with the Lord Jesus. The Lord's death has removed the record of sin that was against us and contrary to us. God is pleased to accept the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus. Therefore, your sin before God is taken care of. Does this mean that we will no longer sin? No. Many times, we still have unclean thoughts. We still lose our temper, and we can still be jealous and proud. We say that sin has been removed, but why are we still sinning? We have to realize that the blood of the Lord Jesus has only dealt with our sins before God; it has not dealt with the sin within us.</P><P>The Bible shows us two aspects of the Lord's death. The record of sins before God has been removed by the Lord's blood. But the sin within us can only be dealt with by the Lord's cross. This is not the so-called eradication of sin, as some have preached, but the crucifixion of our old man through the cross of the Lord. Two days ago we saw that sin is the master within us, the old man is the agent in between, and the body is the slave outside of us. The Lord does not deal with us like the philosophers, who tell others to try their best to buffet their outward bodies. Nor does the Lord remove our sin by eradicating it within us. Rather, when He was crucified, He took our old man along with Him to the cross so that the body of sin becomes unemployed and annulled, and we are no longer slaves to sin. Previously in our Bible study with the brothers and sisters, we have seen that there is a great difference between the function of the Lord's blood and His cross. There is a difference between the sin in the conscience and the sin in the heart. There is also a difference between the sins before God and the sin in man's heart. The Bible never says that the blood will cleanse our hearts. It only says that the blood cleanses our conscience. What is the conscience? It is the part that condemns us, the part that makes us feel our sins. The Lord's blood can make the conscience no longer feel the sin and no longer fear the punishment of sin before God. But the sin of the heart may still remain.</P><P>Later we will speak on this. For now, we only need to know how our sins and unrighteousness are forgiven before God, and how they are absolved and forgotten. Brothers and sisters, we have to know the difference and the distinction between the sins before God and the sin within us. Let me illustrate: Romans 1 through 5:20 is about our sins before God. The sin within man is not mentioned in this portion. Although chapter five mentions the sin of Adam, it is not significant. The whole of Romans 1 through 5 covers our sins before God. This is why it mentions the blood; the blood cleanses us from our sins before God. However, from the last verse in chapter five until chapter eight, the sin within man is detailed. Therefore, this portion never mentions that the blood cleanses our flesh or the sin in our hearts. Instead, it says that the cross has crucified our old man and that the body of sin is unemployed, so that we are no longer slaves to sin.</P><P>We are not speaking about overcoming sin. This is not my topic today. I am just briefly mentioning our sins before God. This sin gives us no peace and gives us a hard time. When we think about this sin, we begin to wonder if we are accepted before God and if God has forgiven us. We begin to wonder if a person who sins as much as we do can stand before God. This sin is completely different from the sin within us. The sin within us can tempt us and snatch us away to sin. It is a law, a power that will seize us and force us to do what we do not want to do. If we do not have the strength to oppose it, we will be blown down like feeble grass in the face of the strong wind and tossed back and forth. We will be captured by something in our heart and forced to do something against our will. We cannot escape its hand. Many Christians doubt if they are even saved because of this experience. Since they still practice many filthy sins, they wonder how they can be saved. They feel this way because they have failed to realize the distinction between the sin within man and the sins before God. Whoever believes in the Lord Jesus is fully cleansed of their sins before God and forgiven. But the sin within them is as filthy and evil as before. The two things are different. The Lord's blood can cleanse us from our sins before God, but it cannot remove the sin within us.</P><P>We have said before that the blood is objective while the cross is subjective. The blood can only redeem us from our sins before God. It takes the cross to deal with the sin within us. As those who have been the slaves of sin, we surely know about the power of sin. When we believe in Jesus as our Savior, the sins we have before God are washed away by the blood of the Lord. But we are still easily tempted to commit the worst sins. This causes us to doubt whether or not we have been saved.</P><P>The Bible clearly separates these two aspects of sins. We have said before that the sin within us was dealt with when the old man was crucified. As long as we stand on this fact by faith, we will fully overcome sin. But now we are speaking of the forgiveness of our sins before God. We all have to admit that we are unclean sinners. If we do not acknowledge that we are sinners, we have never been enlightened by the Holy Spirit. This is the reason that some do not feel the need for salvation. The first thing that the prodigal son said to the father when he returned home was not that he had sore hands or feet, or that he was cold or hungry, or that he had gone through many hardships. The first thing that he said was a confession. He said that he had sinned against heaven and against his father (Luke 15:21). He had a sense of sin. When we are saved, the first thing that we tell God is not that we are poor and deprived, but that we have sinned against Him. Unless the Holy Spirit works in our hearts, we will not know how pitiful and evil we are, and what sinful and wicked sinners we are. We will not realize our dangerous and pitiful position. Only when we pass through God's enlightening work will we admit that we are sinners. Then we will realize that we are in a dangerous position. Before we were saved, we all felt that we were better and stronger than others. We felt that others were black, but that we alone were white. We have to be enlightened before we will realize that we are great sinners. Only then will we deeply regret our past acts, and only then will we be filled with self-condemnation and remorse, hating and abhorring our own lives. Only then will we know what sin is and how evil it is. We will realize that there is a barrier between us and God, and that we cannot draw near to God or communicate with Him. We are contrary to God, and we do not know how to be reconciled to Him. We only know that we are sinners. Every saved person has to pass through this point. Only then will we receive the gospel when it is preached to us. After this, when we believe and receive, we are saved.</P><P>Before a man is saved, he surely feels the heavy and unbearable burden of sin. He surely realizes the terrible punishment for sin and the seriousness of his own sins. When the Holy Spirit begins to work in his heart, he realizes that something has gone wrong between him and God, and he readily believes in Christ. The gospel he hears may not be that clear, and he may only know that he is saved if he believes in Jesus. He may not hear a detailed explanation from others until after he is saved. But the one or two words that he hears begin to work within him and cause him to realize that this is salvation and this is the gospel. The words cause him to believe and receive. Even though he may not fully understand this teaching, he is willing to commit his whole being to the word of the truth and trust in it for his salvation. Later, after much studying, learning, and research, he begins to understand the process and procedure of salvation. He begins to understand the preciousness and wonder of this teaching. This is the experience of most of us. When we first believed, we may not have understood how a man could be saved just by faith, and we may not have understood many other truths in the Bible. But after we were saved, and after passing through a long period of time, we become clear about how a man is saved by faith.</P><P>According to His holy nature, the righteous and holy God has to judge sin. His righteous life makes it mandatory for Him to judge and condemn all unrighteousness. His word says that all those who sin will die and that those who do such things cannot live. Now we have sinned and committed unrighteousness, and He has to condemn us according to the law. As far as His nature is concerned, He is a holy God and cannot allow anyone who has sinned to live. As far as His acts are concerned, He is a righteous God, and He will make sure that all who have sinned will die. As far as God Himself is concerned, He is a God of glory and sinners cannot draw near to Him because they will die. God has to act according to His principle of righteousness, holiness, and glory. God Himself is glorious and beyond the description of human language. This is the reason that it only says in the Old Testament when God entered the temple, that His glory filled the temple. When God's glory is manifested, we have to stand back because we are filled with defilement, and God is absolutely holy. We cannot draw near to God. In the Old Testament the Israelites could only enter the tabernacle when they were atoned by the blood. When God acts according to His principle of righteousness, holiness, and glory, no one can come near to Him. Thank and praise the Lord, the blood has come, and we can now draw near to Him.</P><P>Our sins are not merely forgiven. The reason that they are not merely forgiven is because our sins are also judged before they are forgiven. Our sins are not forgiven without being first judged by God. Brothers and sisters, you can remember many sins of yours, and I can remember many sins of mine. God is not ignorant of our sins and does not gloss over them; He does not skip over the judgment of our sins. He does not do this. We have the Lamb of the Passover. How did God pass over the firstborn among the Israelites? The lamb of the Passover received the judgment. Judgment has also truly passed over us. We have the Lamb of God to take away our sins. If we are clear about this matter, we will be able to peacefully say that we are saved. Many people wonder if they are saved. How do we know that we are saved? Let me say this: God is never careless. He judges sin according to His righteousness. I have said before that grace never reigns directly. It does not reign directly; it always reigns through righteousness. Grace does not come to us directly. Rather, it comes to us through the cross. Apart from the cross and from God's judgment and punishment, there is no grace! We are not forgiven because God has mercy on us when He sees our regret, sorrow, and weeping. God will never respond to this. Weeping, regret, and reform will never win God's forgiveness. We are first judged and then forgiven and saved.</P><P>The title of a gospel tract says Salvation through Faith and Not through Prayer. We are not saved through prayer but by fully trusting in the Lord's death and precious blood which cleanses and redeems us from our sins and from punishment. Therefore, we are saved not directly through grace; we are saved because, after believing, we deserve to be saved. This is righteousness. It would be very painstaking if we had to beg the Lord to save us. We could cry and earnestly beseech, but not know if the Lord had answered us. We would not know that He wanted to sacrifice His life for us and save sinners like us. If He did not answer our prayers, no one could say that He was not righteous or wrong. Thank God that He Himself caused the Lord Jesus to come to the earth, die on the cross, be buried in a tomb, and resurrect and ascend on the third day. Thank God that His Son accomplished redemption. He died because of our sins and was resurrected for our justification. From that day on, God could save sinners. From that day on, everyone who believes in and receives His Son is saved. If He did not save us, He would be unrighteous. This may sound presumptuous, but even if God does not want to save us, there is no way for Him not to save us. He cannot hold back His salvation, because He has accepted the redemption that the Lord has accomplished on the cross. The Lord died and paid all the debts of sins. Therefore, He has to save us.</P><P>I really like the following story. Once two sisters were playing together. Both were very young, and both were saved. The younger one asked the older one, "How were you saved?" The older one said, "By God's grace." The younger one then said, "But I am saved by God's righteousness." She was right. God has accepted the Lord's death and resurrection. The punishment and judgment that we deserve have all been executed on the cross of the Lord. Now we can be saved through God's righteousness.</P><P>Concerning the matter of forgiveness, many people have lost sight of the fact that we are dealing with God within the confines of the covenant. Is it by grace that we are now saved and freed? No, it is by righteousness. Suppose a rich man has written a ten thousand dollar check to a poor man. Whenever the poor man lacks something, he can go to the bank and cash it. This is clearly tremendous grace. But if, when the poor man takes the check to the bank, the bank refuses to cash it for him, this would be unrighteousness. The rich man does not have to give the poor man the ten thousand dollar check. But if he has given it to the poor man, and the bank does not cash it, then this constitutes unrighteousness and is no longer just a lack of grace. The denial is a matter of unrighteousness and unfaithfulness. The Lord has been crucified. If God did not forgive us, He would be unrighteous, and I say this most reverently. If God had not given us His Son, we could only say that He does not love us or is not gracious to us. But He has given us His Son, who died for us. He was crucified, and His blood was shed. He has passed through God's judgment and punishment. If God did not save us, would this not be unrighteousness? God saves us according to righteousness. However, today we are not lifting up God's righteousness; we are lifting up His grace and the cross. Only the greatest grace can accomplish this.</P><P>Some people have asked how they can know that they are saved. They did not have the peace and joy of salvation that others had after they prayed. They did not dare say that they were saved. I asked them, "Have you received the Lord Jesus? If you have, you are saved." God cannot sin (which I say most reverently); in the same way, He cannot be unrighteous. Being unrighteous is to sin. Since God cannot sin, He cannot be unrighteous either; He has to save us. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, shed His blood, and was judged and punished, we were also judged and punished. God can no longer punish us or send us to the lake of fire. He has to save us. If we have believed in Jesus and accepted Him as the redeeming Savior, God can say nothing more to us. Brothers and sisters, this is all I can say. Today God has confined Himself to His covenant; He is no longer free. Everyone who has believed in His Son is saved. Do you still doubt His ability to save you?</P><P>Today I will ask one question. Please answer and pardon me for asking in this way. Do you know for sure that your sins are forgiven? Will you still perish? You have accepted the Lord Jesus and believed in Him, but do you know that you are saved? Will you still perish? Truly I tell you, even if heaven and earth passed away, you and I would never perish. The devil has no way to make you perish; the angels have no way to stop you from being saved; even God Himself has no power to make you perish (I say this most reverently); even if you wanted to perish and no longer be saved, you could not do so anymore.</P><P>What does Hebrews 8:12 say? "For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I shall by no means remember anymore." This refers to God's forgiveness of us in Christ Jesus. Since Christ has died for us, God can be propitious to our unrighteousnesses. The next clause says, "And their sins I shall by no means remember anymore." What does this mean? Why will God not remember our sins? Does this mean that He has forgotten our sins? Precisely! Many times, the things that God remembers, we forget, and the things that God forgets, we remember. What has God forgotten? Has He not fully forgotten our sins to the extent that they have disappeared as clouds and smoke? God said that He has erased our sins and that there is nothing more to them. Unfortunately, many people still remember their sins. They think that they have committed many gross sins and wonder if God will ever forgive and forget these sins. They think that it is unlikely that God will ever forgive or forget these sins. Many people have a memory that is too good. Their memory is better than God's. Many people think that God has merely rubbed away our sins and that when He sees the rubbed-away marks, He will be reminded of our sins. I can tell you that God has forgotten all your sins. Through the blood of the Lord Jesus, God has forgotten all of our sins, both big sins and small sins, both this sin and that sin, both the sins we remember and the sins we have forgotten, both intentional sins and unintentional sins-every sin-so that it is as if we have never sinned. Everyone who has heard this gospel will say, "Hallelujah!" There is no gospel better than this gospel. Through the Lord Jesus, God has forgotten the sins of everyone who has believed. All our sins have been washed away by the blood of the Lord.</P><P>The first fulfillment of the new covenant is being cleansed of our sins by God. The forgiveness of our sins by God is something that belongs to the covenant; it is not apart from the covenant. Hallelujah! Today we have seen that God covenanted with us to forgive and not remember our sins. Do you still not know that you are saved? Are you still afraid that you will perish? You can say to God, "God, you have made a covenant with me. Have you forgotten about my forgiveness? Please execute this matter, according to Your covenant." When you pray this way, you can immediately rise up and forget about everything else. Since you have done your part, God will surely be faithful to do His part. The forgiveness of sin does not come through earnest begging, but through a righteous procedure that is based on our right under the blood. The forgiveness of sins is our legitimate right. God cannot forgive or not forgive according to His likes or dislikes. He has made a covenant with us, and He has to act according to His covenant. He has purposely given us this handle so that we can lay hold of it.</P><P>Hebrews 10:1-2 says, "For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the image itself of the things, can never by the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, perfect those who draw near. Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, because those worshipping, having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins?" Since our conscience has been purified, we no longer have the consciousness of sins. This is what the sacrifices offered year after year could never do. Only the blood of the Lord Jesus can do this. When God sees the blood, He will forget our sins and cause our conscience to have no more consciousness of sins. Before we were saved, we were often conscious of our sins and had no way to stop our conscience from condemning us. After we believed, we saw that the Lord's blood was shed for our redemption. He suffered the punishment of sin to the point of death, and He received, on our behalf, the punishment that we deserve. From this point on, no sin can make our conscience remember or suffer anymore. Since the conscience is cleansed, we have no consciousness of sins anymore. If we do not worship God in this way, we do not have a way to worship Him, because we truly do not have the assurance that we are saved and have eternal life. Before God, we will just drift. We must first be able to stand before we can run. In the same way, without standing firmly on the ground of salvation, we can never advance and never run the spiritual race before us. Consequently, when we break the bread, we cannot praise, rejoice, and worship God like others, for deep in our hearts, we do not have the assurance of salvation. Thank the Lord for His blood, because it can cleanse us of all our sins before Him so that our conscience will have no more consciousness of them. Now, before God, we can enjoy His grace and unlimited love because we know that there is no more problem, and we are no longer conscious that we are sinners.</P><P>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Do you know what faithfulness is and what righteousness is? Faithfulness is related to God's word, while righteousness is related to God's acts. God is faithful to every word that He speaks and righteous in every act of His. Why does God forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness? His words are faithful. Since He has said that He will forgive us, He will surely forgive us. Furthermore, His acts are righteous. Since He has sent His Son to take away our sins and bear our punishment, He has to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. According to His faithful promise, He has to forgive us. According to His righteous act, He has to reckon the death of His Son as our death and the judgment and punishment of His Son as our judgment and punishment. He is righteous and cannot claim His debt twice. He cannot be that wrong. He cannot claim the debt from the Lord, and then come to us to claim the same debt. He cannot do this. If He does, He will be unrighteous. Therefore, we can ask for His forgiveness and cleansing according to the covenant that He made with us.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, when we confess our sins and ask for God's forgiveness, can He answer or refuse according to His pleasure? No, He cannot do this because forgiveness is an item within the covenant. If we confess our sins, according to the covenant God has to forgive us and cleanse us from our sins and unrighteousness. If we confess, according to the covenant, God will surely not remember our sins and surely be propitious to our unrighteousness.</P><P>Friends, do you know how to speak to God based on the covenant? Would you dare to hold onto God's covenant and say to Him, "Your covenant says that if we confess our sins, You will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Now I come and confess my sins. Please forgive my sins and cleanse me from all unrighteousness." The Bible does not say that our sins will be forgiven only when we have prayed to the point that we have peace. It does not say that if we do not have peace after we pray, our sins have not been forgiven. There is not such a thing in the Bible. We have to realize that when God made a covenant with us, His intention was for us to speak to Him according to the word of the covenant. He wants us to ask Him in faith. When we ask God to accomplish the word of the covenant for us, we are not begging for mercy but are claiming our rightful portion according to the covenant. Thank God that within the covenant, there is the word of forgiveness.</P><P>We can mourn and lament over our own sins. We can do our best to hate sin and make up our mind never to sin. We can acknowledge that sin is a great suffering and say that we dare not come to God when we have sinned. But none of these things can make us godly. If we think that by earnestly hating sin, we will be more easily forgiven, we are not trusting in God's Word. We may think that by mourning and lamenting over sin, we will be more easily forgiven, but there is not such a thing in the Bible.</P><P>The writer of the book The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life, Mrs. Smith, once asked a saved girl what she would do if she were to sin again, and what would Jesus do if she were to sin again? The girl answered that if she sinned, Jesus would make her suffer for a while and then would forgive her. Do not think that this is a child's word. This is what adults do all the time. Many adults have the same thought. They think that after they sin, they have to suffer for a while before they can be forgiven. Friends, forgiveness is by the blood and not by our mourning and lamenting. Forgiveness does not come after waiting a long time until we do not feel sorry anymore and have peace. Forgiveness is something within God's covenant. God promised, through the Lord Jesus' shedding of the blood, that He will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Today, when we receive and believe in the Lord, God will forgive and be propitious to our sins according to the covenant and will not remember our sins anymore. Who among us today still has no peace in his heart? Who is still afraid that his sins have not yet been forgiven? You have to know that God is not so high that He is unapproachable. Nor is He free to do whatever He wants according to His will and pleasure. He is bound by His covenant. All you have to do is ask Him according to the covenant and speak to Him according to the promises in His covenant.</P><P>Do you know what surrounds God's throne? It is a rainbow. As long as the rainbow remains around the throne, God will answer a prayer that we pray according to the covenant. Revelation 4:3 says that the throne is surrounded by a rainbow. On earth we only see one end of the rainbow, but in heaven the rainbow encircles the throne. What does the rainbow signify? The rainbow is a sign of the covenant that God made with Noah. He told Noah that the rainbow would appear in the clouds. When He sees the rainbow, He remembers the eternal covenant that He made with all the living creatures on earth. The sign of the covenant encircles the throne. The covenant is surrounding God. Therefore, He has to answer our prayers. How wonderful it is that God has given to us such a handle and surety to lay hold of.</P><P>Who among us still has his sins unresolved? You can bring your sins to God, take hold of His Word, and believe in Him according to His covenant. We can rest in His covenant and deal with God by taking hold of His Word. If we do this, we will see God working according to His Word. In "that day" we will see how God's grace and love flows forever to eternity in heaven and how it flows to us. The reason we have lost many spiritual blessings and rest is that we do not realize that God has made a covenant with us. When we speak to Him according to the covenant, He will act according to the covenant. The reason we have not received, even after knowing this, is that we do not have the faith and have not acted according to the covenant. If, after we know it, we act on it, we will surely receive the spiritual blessings and rest that God has promised us. The sooner we do this, the sooner we will receive.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEW COVENANT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(7)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 36</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:28; Heb. 8:10-12</H1><P>We have read this passage in Hebrews 8 over and over. If we study this portion carefully, we will see that it contains three promises: (1) The law will be imparted into the mind and inscribed on the heart, to the effect that God will become God to us, and we will become God's people. (2) The result of the law within our heart is that we will know God. We will not only know God's will and God's commandment, but know God. (3) Not only will God be propitious to our unrighteousnesses, but will forgive our sins. The items that we listed [in the fifth message on the new covenant] reverses this order. We had cleansing as the first item, knowledge the second, and life and power the third. This was according to our spiritual experience. We are first cleansed and forgiven, then made to enjoy God's life and power, and finally know God.</P><P>The thought in Hebrews 8:10 continues through the end of verse 11. Verse 12 is another beginning. At the beginning of verse 12 there is the word "for." This means that forgiveness has been accomplished. God is propitious to our sins and forgives our unrighteousness, then He puts the law into us and inscribes it upon our hearts, with the result being that we know God. This knowledge of God will fill the earth as the water, and no one will teach his neighbor or brothers to know God. Therefore, the order of our spiritual experience is: (1) cleansing, (2) life and power, and (3) knowledge.</P><P>In Philippians 3, Paul told us his experience. First he received God's righteousness --he was justified apart from his own righteousness. Then he considered all things as loss in order that he might gain Christ and know the Lord. The knowledge of God came after forgiveness. Forgiveness is once for all, but the knowledge of God goes deeper and deeper. Day by day we know God more and more. However, I will not speak about knowledge today but about the second aspect of our spiritual experience, which is life and power. We will not cover life and power completely; we will only speak on the part about life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW TO HAVE LIFE AND POWER</H2><P>Hebrews 8:7 says, "For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second." In God's eyes, the first covenant had faults and was weak; it did not have the power and way for us to keep God's commandments. As far as the first covenant is concerned, Paul also said in the book of Romans that the law was holy but was not able to do many things (7:12). As far as the power of the first covenant is concerned, it also had faults. This is why there is the need for the second covenant.</P><P>Why did the first covenant have faults? Let us read 8:8-9, "For finding fault with them He says, `Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah, not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.'" The Lord said that when He took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, they did not continue in the Lord's covenant. This means that they should have continued to be faithful. However, they were not able to be faithful day after day. Even though they made up their minds to follow the Lord, they could not faithfully follow Him every day. Even though they were revived once, they could not be revived every day. They might have promised to read the Bible every day, but they could not. This was the problem with the old covenant.</P><P>Exodus 19:5 says, "Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine." This is God's word to the Israelites. Verse 8 says, "And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do." Immediately they said that they would keep the words. Let us read again Exodus 24:8, "And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words." Everything recorded from chapter nineteen to 24:8 are the words of God's covenant. Moses said that this was the blood of the covenant, and the people answered saying, "All the words which the Lord hath said will we do" (24:3). Brothers and sisters, in Exodus 19 through 24, God's law says that we cannot have other gods and worship idols. Please remember that the contents of Exodus 19 through 24 are the whole covenant. But by chapter thirty-two, before Moses delivered the tablets of the covenant from Mount Sinai, the Israelites had made a golden calf and started to worship the idol. The tablets of the covenant were still up in the mountain, and the Israelites had already betrayed the covenant! They were worshipping the golden calf at the bottom of the mountain. This shows that they could not keep God's law. This is the shortage of the old covenant.</P><P>Therefore, the old covenant means that we can temporarily make up our minds and be excited; we can shout to God that we will do His will. But even if we keep the law for a few days, this will not last. We can find out the teachings in the Bible, but cannot keep its commandments. We can behold God's glory on Mount Sinai, but sin at the bottom of the mountain. We can rise up early to read the Bible and pray, but we forget about God in the office, hospital, school, or at home. This means that even though there may be good beginnings, there are no good endings. This is the old covenant. However, God has given us the new covenant which is within us. Second Corinthians 3 says that the law was previously written on tablets of stone; now it is written on the tablet of our heart. Today the new covenant is the best gospel. The new covenant is entirely different from the old covenant. In the new covenant, the One who gives the command is God, and the One who is responsible to keep the command is also God. In the old covenant, the One who gave the commandment and the law was God, but we were the ones who kept them. In the new covenant, the One who made the law is God, and the One who keeps the law is also God.</P><P>Today Christians everywhere are very ignorant of this gospel. However, the gospel of the forgiveness of sins can be found everywhere. Everyone knows about the death of the Lord and the blood He shed to save us and forgive us of our sins. Many people have faith in this and can lay hold of this. They believe in this part of the new covenant and preach it. They know that God is propitious to unrighteousness and sins. But it is amazing that only one third of the new covenant has been believed by men. The other two thirds are set aside. An ignorant sinner thinks that he has to try his best to do good before he can be saved. He thinks this way because he has never heard the gospel. But we will not think this way anymore. We know that we are children by promise and not by works. We know that God has promised to forgive and forget all our sins through Jesus Christ. We know that when we believe in Him according to His Word, we will receive forgiveness. It is amazing that we know that we are saved by the Word of God and not by ourselves, but in the matter of overcoming, we think that we have to strive, struggle, and wrestle.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, both salvation and overcoming are in the same covenant. This covenant gives us the power to go on in the way ahead of us. Overcoming sin, obeying God, and the filling of the Holy Spirit are all included in this covenant. The way we receive the grace of forgiveness is the same way we receive the grace to overcome sin. The way our sins are forgiven before God is the same way we overcome our sins before God. Just as we felt that we could not have forgiveness in ourselves, we should feel that we are weak and are unable to do good and overcome sin in ourselves. The old covenant was God holding the Israelites' hands and bringing them out of Egypt. Today God is holding our heart and leading us out of Egypt. Formerly God put the law in their hands. Now God is putting the law in our hearts. Today there is something mysterious that tells us what is and what is not of God.</P><P>First, let us consider how God puts the power within us, and how He strengthens us to overcome. Ezekiel 36 and Jeremiah 31 are similar passages. Ezekiel 36 refers to the salvation of the Jews during the millennium. Jeremiah 31 refers to the same thing. However, in some areas, Jeremiah's words are clearer, while in other areas, Ezekiel's words are clearer. Hebrews 8 is a quotation of Jeremiah 31. Therefore, the last two are similar.</P><P>Ezekiel 36:25 says, "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you." This means the same thing as in Hebrews 8 when it says that He will be propitious to our unrighteousness and cleanse us from our iniquities.</P><P>Verses 26 through 27 say, "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them." Please pay attention to the word cause in verse 27. This is a strong word. It is a verb. Can you see the glory in verses 26 and 27? This explains Jeremiah 31. Verse 26 mentions our spirit, while verse 27 mentions God's Spirit. The second Spirit is not our spirit, but is something that God gives to us. Therefore, we have a new spirit, a new heart, and the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit enables us to do God's will and keep God's laws. The law written on the tablets of stone is outward. There is nothing within ourselves that is compatible with the law on the stone tablets. This is why we cannot keep God's commandments. Today God has written the law within us. Not only has He written it within us, He has given us a new spirit, a new heart, and the Holy Spirit which cause us to obey Him. This is regeneration. Not only do we have a new spirit which enables us to fellowship with God, but we have a new heart which enables us to love God and everything spiritual. This new heart causes us to develop a love for God; it is contrary to the heart of stone. Not only do we have a new spirit and a new heart, but the Holy Spirit. This Holy Spirit causes our new heart to have the strength to love God and our new spirit to have the power to fellowship with Him.</P><P>Some have asked, "Why does God have to give us the Holy Spirit in addition to the new spirit and the new heart?" If we know the function of our body, we will know. With our body, there are the voluntary actions and involuntary actions. For example, moving our hands and feet requires the exercise of the will; these are voluntary actions. In addition to these actions, there is digestion by the stomach and metabolism by the cells which are not under man's control; these are involuntary actions. Voluntary actions are controlled by the will, and involuntary actions are spontaneous and controlled by a natural law. When we were saved, we received a new spirit and a new heart; these are "involuntary"; they spontaneously operate according to their new functions and new desires. However, God has not only given us these things. He has also given us the Holy Spirit so that we can be led by Him wholeheartedly, receive revelation from Him wholeheartedly, and trust in His power wholeheartedly. These must all be done through the exercise of the will and through conscious effort. God desires that, spiritually, we have an involuntary living as well as a voluntary living. If we do not understand God's will and do not follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit will be grieved, and we will be hindered from receiving guidance and revelation from the Holy Spirit. This will cause the voluntary action of the spiritual life to cease. Of course, the spontaneous and involuntary actions of the spiritual life will not cease. However, without the power of the Holy Spirit, the new spirit and the new heart would be very much weakened.</P><P>God has not only given us a new heart and new spirit, He has also given us the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, He has put the law within us and inscribed it in our hearts so that our life will spontaneously crave God. At the same time, the Holy Spirit of God within us enables us to carry out what the spirit understands and what the heart desires.</P><P>In Kuling, Kiukiang, there was a brother who was an electrician. Originally he was a nominal Christian who was not even clear about his salvation. He did not know if he was saved. Once after I studied the Bible with him, he became clear that he was saved. I have known him for five or six years. This year while I was speaking on the experience of the Holy Spirit, to my surprise, he told me that he had experienced what I was speaking about even though he had never read this verse before. He said that he had a "steward" within him (this is what he called the Holy Spirit) which tells him if something is right or wrong. He was half illiterate. When he first believed in the Lord, he could hardly read a few words of a verse. Yet he had the Holy Spirit within him leading him, instructing him, and being a steward to him. This is a living example. Should this not be the experience of every Christian?</P><P>Many times, we do not know what we should do concerning the things that we encounter. Yet many times, before we act, we know that something is wrong. Our conscience is not telling us this; the conscience only works after something wrong is done. But, in this case, we know that something is wrong because the law of God tells us within. Sometimes when we are talking to someone and excited concerning what we are talking about, something within stops us and forbids us to say some further words which may not even be unscriptural or morally corrupting. But we just feel that something within us is giving us a pinch and telling us not to say anything more. We do not know why. If we take care of this and obey it, we will have the peace. Otherwise, when the words come out, our conscience will tell us that we have done wrong. This is the law within us. Subconsciously, it will stop us and issue a warning to us.</P><P>Let me tell you another story. A certain Christian was an active believer. He loved to offer hospitality to other believers and Christian workers. He always did his best to either invite the preachers that he met to meals or to give money to them. Once, a pastor who graduated from an American school was preaching in his chapel. He was preaching the social gospel and not preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus. After the meeting the brother wanted to go over to greet the pastor and talk to him. But he felt something was nagging at him. He hesitated for a while and did not walk forward. Finally he decided to forget about the pastor and just went home. Brothers and sisters, this is the law written within us; it is not the law written on a tablet of stone. Later this brother asked me if he could associate himself with the pastor. I did not tell him my opinion. Instead I only quoted Galatians 1:8, which says that if any man preaches another gospel that is different from ours, he should be accursed (a strong word of rebuke in Greek). Not only did Paul say this, even John said the same thing. John was called the apostle of love. Love should make a person foolish. Yet John said that if any man does not preach this teaching, we should not receive him into our house and should not greet him (2 John 10). The brother then said, "Now I know that the leading within me and the law within me were right."</P><P>Brothers and sisters, the Holy Spirit inspired men to write the Bible. The Holy Spirit also gives us the inspirations within. If we would be faithful and honest to follow the inner leading, God will surely lead us on. Sometimes we can be mistaken through our prejudice. I am not telling you to not pay attention to the Bible. I am telling you to link the Bible with the inner leading and judge what we do as right or wrong according to this way. This does not mean that the Holy Spirit is not leading believers today, nor does it mean that the believers have no leading from the Holy Spirit. The pitiful thing is that they are not willing to be led by the Holy Spirit. Many read the Bible like reading a dead book. Reading the Bible to them is like memorizing the Ten Commandments, because they cannot see any leading of the Holy Spirit there. I do not despise the Bible at all; I am very concerned that the leading of the Holy Spirit must match the teaching of the Bible. Yet it is a bad phenomenon today that many people seem to have no leading apart from the Bible. They are following the Lord without any speaking from the Lord.</P><P>The reason many brothers and sisters cannot receive new truths is that they have refused and rejected the leading of the light. As a result, God puts aside the light. God has placed the law within us, and He is constantly testifying to the truths. If we reject these testimonies, day by day we will find ourselves more and more in darkness. But if we are willing to be led, day by day we will become clearer and clearer. Someone has said that the enlightening of the Holy Spirit is the light, while our inner being is the glass. If the glass is not cleaned, it will become more and more darkened and receive less and less of the light. The reason why many people cannot receive truths is that they have rejected the truths once before. Many people cannot believe in the truths, because they have once refused the truths. The Holy Spirit is responsible within us to show what is and what is not of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BASIC DISTINCTION IN THE LEADING OF GOD</H2><P>Everything from man, the world, Satan, or the flesh comes from the outside. Everything from God and the Holy Spirit comes from the inside. If we encounter something and this thing arises from our head and occupies very little weight, it must be from the outside. If it is God's leading, deeper than feeling, it is always from the inside and is a sensation that cannot be removed or ignored. If we have a feeble mind, we may easily forget the verses we have memorized. If we are tired, we may be unable to read the Bible. Sometimes when we are faced with some situation on the street, we may not have time to ask for the advice of others and consult a teaching from the Bible. But within us there is a living law leading us, whose leading is spontaneously compatible with the teaching of the Bible. This can be confirmed by the experience of many. If we repeatedly follow God's leading, which comes from the inward law within us, we will gradually be clear about the leading which comes from God's law within us. If God has made a covenant to put the law within us and to lead us, we can take hold of God's covenant and say to God: "I have Your law within me. Therefore, I will surely know Your will."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOD'S WILL<br>AND GOD'S HEART</H2><P>We have to know God's will item by item. But knowing God's heart is different. One English brother with deep experience in the Lord and who knows God well once said that we not only can know God's will, but also His heart. We do not despise God's will. In order to know His will, we have to seek after Him wholeheartedly. But God's heart has been given to us already; it is something that we know without consciously seeking. One Western missionary said that when he drinks milk, he prays to see if he should put one or two cubes of sugar in the milk. This is unnecessary. We should have God's heart, and we should know His heart. God has not only given us the Bible for us to keep, but He has given us the law within us so that we can know His heart. When we encounter a crisis, we should surely seek God's will. In our daily life, we can act according to God's heart; there is no need to purposely ask God. We are those who have God's heart within us already, so we know what we should do to conform to His will. Can you see the glory here?</P><P>Men in the Old Testament had to consult the law or a prophet before they could be clear about God's will. But we have a Prophet within us today. He will tell us everything. We also have a law which is not outward. An outward prophet or outward regulations have not been put upon us. Rather, we are instructed by God within us, who gives us an unspeakable sensation, a feeling which, at the same time, is not quite a feeling. This is what believers experience every day. Do we have such an experience? We may not have it every day, but at least we should have experienced it a few times.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD JESUS BEING THE ARK</H2><P>The first stone tablets which Moses received were smashed to pieces. The second tablets which he received were placed in the ark. The ark is a type of the Lord Jesus Christ. God ordered that blood be sprinkled on the ark, His glory was manifested from above the ark, and He spoke to man from above the ark. All these are pictures of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>Do we see the ark-life in the Lord Jesus? "The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works" (John 14:10). "For I have come down..not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me" (John 6:38). We can see how the Lord Jesus obeyed God's word and did His will. He was not only acting according to the teaching of the Scripture but according to the inner law within Him. It is better to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit than the leading of the Bible in a dead way. Consider John 12. John 11 speaks of the Lord's raising up Lazarus. Chapter twelve speaks of the most glorious day the Lord had on earth. Not only was Lazarus resurrected, but the Greeks came to the Lord Jesus also. But whether or not they came to Him, whether or not Lazarus was resurrected, and whether or not He received glory when he entered Jerusalem, He said: "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" (John 12:24). Later He said: "Now is My soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save Me out of this hour. But for this reason I have come to this hour" (John 12:27). This word of the Lord Jesus was from His heart! Others might have considered that this was His best time. But He considered that a grain of wheat would abide alone if it did not die. In His heart He said, "Now is My soul troubled; and what shall I say?" He did not immediately say what He wanted to say, but instead cried out: "Father, save Me out of this hour." But was that possible? No. Because it was for this hour that He had come. What then did He do? Verse 28 says, "Father, glorify Your name." The Lord did not say, "Father, deliver Me from this hour." Brothers and sisters, here we see the life that is within the Lord Jesus. He is led by the Spirit of God. He is truly the ark.</P><P>The ark was covered with gold on the outside which signifies the divinity of the Lord. Within the gold was the acacia wood which signifies the Lord's humanity. Therefore, the Lord has both the body of a man and the holiness of God. But within Him, there is the law which is more significant than the outward attributes that are seen and understood by men. The failure of the Pharisees was in the fact that they only saw the law placed in a high place in the synagogue. They did not see the law within the Lord Jesus. Among us today, there are some who do not know God's will and do not know how to act in this and that matter. Let me say that forgiveness is not the only item within the new covenant. His leading and law, which are within the new heart and new spirit, as well as the Holy Spirit of God are also within us and are part of the new covenant. It is a pity that many people only cling to the part about salvation. In many places, people are satisfied as long as they hear the gospel and are saved. But God has not only given us a gospel of salvation. Why would we not build a full mansion on the land that is allotted to us according to God's deed? Why do we have to build only a small hut on one little corner of the lot and leave the other parts deserted?</P><P>We should pray about many things. But with many things, we are clear even before we pray about them. I am not saying that the teaching of the Bible is not important. I am saying that the inner leading is more precious than outward leadings. Many people have said that they do not know what to do with this and that, and what should they do if they find out that they have made a mistake. My answer is that you have God's new heart, new spirit, the Holy Spirit, and the law within you. Some have often asked, "How in our experience and actual daily life can we still live like the Israelites in the Old Testament? Why do we still need the outward leading?" Let me ask, "Why was the book of Hebrews written?" The book of Hebrews was written for the Christians among the Hebrews. They were New Testament Christians living Old Testament lives. They were clearly men of the New Testament, yet they lived Old Testament lives. So there was a need for the book of Hebrews. Its purpose is to tell us that we do not have to live the Old Testament life anymore. The goal of Hebrews is to lead men out of the experience of the Old Testament into the experience of the New Testament. Do not be surprised that many Christians still live a life according to the Old Testament. Their experiences of salvation, receiving of the eternal life, and forgiveness are all real, yet they still live the Old Testament life. Praise God, He is no longer leading us out of Egypt by holding our hands, but by holding our hearts.</P><P>Some have asked why it is that in the Old Testament, men could see God and hear His voice directly, while we cannot today. We have to thank God that men in the Old Testament saw God with their physical eyes and heard Him with their physical ears. But today, in the New Testament, we do not have to do this. God has hidden Himself. He is within us now and is no longer outside of us. I know what I am saying. The deeper we go, the more we will realize that all the outward excitement and activities are gone. We will realize that everything has become inward. More and more, we will become normal, and men will not be surprised when they see us. The more we go on, the deeper our experience will be, the more blessing we will receive from God, and the more we will have the experience of knowing God. The more we go on, the more subjective experience we will have and the more we will gain God. Please remember that this knowledge is part of God's covenant. Whoever has not received this leading can cling to the covenant and say to God, "This is what You have said in Your covenant, and I want it." Do not say that we will not have it. Because of this covenant, we can receive what we should receive every day. God has to give it to us. The blood of the Lord Jesus has purchased this covenant, and God's faithfulness and righteousness guarantee that everything in this covenant will be ours. Therefore, we can cling to this covenant, speak to God, and pray to Him by standing on this covenant in faith.</P></body></html>
