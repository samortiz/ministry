   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS OUR SIN OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 4:1-15, 22-28, 32; 6:25-30; 2 Cor 5:21a; Rom 8:3b; Heb 9:12; 13:11-12 FIVE OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This chapter will cover the sin offering, which is the fourth kind of offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When discussing the first offering, we pointed out why the five kinds of offerings were needed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is because, in the presence of God, we are in five kinds of situations or conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were made for God, but we are not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we need Christ as the One who is absolutely for God as our burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither are we fine or perfect or properly balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, we need Christ as the meal offering, because He is so fine, so perfect, and so balanced in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, we have no peace with God or with others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the whole universe there is no peace, and among human beings there is no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the schools there is no peace; in society there is no peace; among the nations there is no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Though we have the United Nations, there is still no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no peace in the homes between husbands and wives and between children and parents.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not have peace with God, and we do not have peace with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So we need Christ as our peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And even more than that, we are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are just sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So we need Christ as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And because we are sin, we are full of mistakes and wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is nothing right with us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are wrong with our parents; we are wrong with our husband; we are wrong with our wife; we are wrong with our brothers; we are wrong with our sisters; we are wrong with our children; we are wrong with everyone!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even in the way we dress and cut our hair we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are wrong in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At one time in the past I was dealing with the Lord about certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I thought that about an hour would be enough time to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But I soon discovered that I was wrong in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There was nothing in which I was right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we need Christ as our trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is our condition before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not for God; we are not fine and perfect; we have no peace with God and man; we are just sin itself; and we are full of mistakes and wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are our five conditions, so we need five kinds of offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that we can apply Christ in at least five aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is just the One that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not for God, but He is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not perfect, but He is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not have peace, but He is peace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are sinful; we are sin, but He is the sin offering to deal with our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And we are full of mistakes, but He is our trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have such a Christ, who takes care of all our situations before God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not consider that we are such wonderful persons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not one among us is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In fact, we are pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are not for God; we are still for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have mentioned the matter of thanksgiving and the vow in the last chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are for thanksgiving; we are not for a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This indicates that we are so much for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have no concern for God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not perfect and fine, and we really do not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our mind is not a mind for God; it is a mind for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we consider ourselves in the light, the more we find that there is nothing but sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But, praise the Lord, we are so much negatively, and Christ is so much positively!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whatever we are not, He is.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can enjoy Him as the burnt offering and as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These are the two basic offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And based upon these offerings, we can enjoy Him as our peace offering.</S>
