   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The good seed are the sons of the kingdom v.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>38 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous parable the seed is the word of the kingdom; in this parable the good seed are the sons of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous parable the seed is the word of God; in this parable the word passed through men, making them the sons of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the seeds are sown into the ground, one by one they become wheat; when the word falls into our heart, we become sons of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the word we are made sons of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Peter 1:23 says that we have been regenerated through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have received the new life through the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the word of God falls into our heart, it immediately becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sons of the kingdom are those who belong to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From this we can see two meanings of the kingdom of the heavens: 1 The sphere of the kingdom of the heavens in its appearance is as large as the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2 When the sphere becomes more restricted, we have only the sons of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The sons of the kingdom are those who are qualified to inherit the kingdom; they are those who represent the kingdom and who belong to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are the opposite of the sons of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can man be regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a gospel preacher preaches a certain word to you, you believe and receive this word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then you also receive life, which is in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 25: "But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here it is the men sleeping, not the sower.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord as the sower never sleeps or slumbers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The men were the slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Broadly speaking, they refer to us; strictly speaking, they refer to the people at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are two aspects to sleeping: 1 It is natural and therefore cannot be criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 It is to be tired, that is, not to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The "enemy" is the devil v. 39 , and the "tares" are people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 38, as the wheat signifies men, so the tares also signify men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The "sons of the evil one" are not the unbelievers in the world; rather, they are those who mixed with the wheat, like the mixed multitude among the children of Israel when they went out from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There have been tares in the church in every age, such as Judas in the early days and H.E. Fosdick a modernist in the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning the wheat and the tares, someone who was familiar with the geographical background of the Jews gave the following explanation: After the wheat and the tares are sown, they sprout and grow up to a height of one foot, two feet, or four feet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At these stages they are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When they bear fruit, they are still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not until their fruit has ripened are they distinguishable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fruit of the tares is black, and that of the wheat is golden yellow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to determine which is a tare and which is wheat, one must wait until the fruit becomes ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"His enemy ... went away."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the enemy's way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Bible prophecies tell us that in the last days there will be a great apostasy, a great turning away from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not know the truth that they will turn away from, but the Bible tells us how the turning away from the truth will be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It will be just as Paul said: men will forbid marriage and command the eating of vegetables 1 Tim 4:3 things related to our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John told us that, with regard to the truth, the apostates will deny the Father and the Son 1 John 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, John stressed the matter of confessing that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Peter in his second Epistle said that the apostates will care only to have money, and the result they are seeking is the separating of the flock 2 Pet 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This kind of situation was already mentioned at the time of Paul, John, and Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since the second century there have been countless debates concerning the person of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to history, those who sow the tares are those who deny that Jesus is the Christ, yet they still call themselves Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 26: "And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares appeared also."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The clause "when the blade sprouted" has two meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, it refers to the time of the ripening for the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second, it refers to the time the conduct is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The harvest of the field is at the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The time of the manifestation of the conduct is indicated in verse 27, where the slaves of the master of the house have already begun to wonder.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the second century, when the heresies were rising up, the slaves had no idea what was happening, so they told the master of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 27: "And the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Where then did the tares come from?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The slaves did not know who had sown the tares.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When they saw the tares coming out, they did not understand why it was happening.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today it is the same in pioneering a work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Originally, there are a few very good ones, but later some bad condition suddenly appears.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The slaves knew only the result but did not know the cause.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, the master said that it was done by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The tares are mixed with the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Satan's work is not only to oppose but also to imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not only does Satan transfigure himself into an angel of light, but his followers also transfigure themselves into ministers of righteousness 2 Cor 11:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If possible, Satan persecutes; if not, he imitates.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, persecution should not be feared as much as counterfeiting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is not one kind of spiritual experience that Satan cannot counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Satan will counterfeit even such high matters as the fellowship between God and man and the union of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For instance, Frank Buchman, founder and director of the Oxford Group , wrote a book concerning regenerated Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although the book was well written, it mentions neither the death of Christ nor the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Without blood, one can still be regenerated!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is really heresy!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Buchman also spoke on the union of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How did he put it?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He said that all that is required is meditation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He spoke neither of the reading of the Bible nor of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is strange that without reading the Bible or depending on the Spirit, one can still understand God's desire!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That he did not touch these things is a real danger.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today the revival movement at Oxford University is of the Buchman group.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, there were students who testified that they did not believe in Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today Satan counterfeits regeneration, salvation, and the fellowship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, without the truth, the experience must be false.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When people are saved, they should have a spiritual salvation and not a psychological salvation.</S>
