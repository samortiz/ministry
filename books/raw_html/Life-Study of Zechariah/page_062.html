<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIFTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A WORD CONCERNING THE HUMAN SPIRIT<br>AND THE CHRIST UNVEILED IN ZECHARIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Zech. 12:1; Isa. 42:5-6; John 4:24; 2 Tim. 4:22; Zech. 3:9; Rev. 5:6; Zech. 1:8-11, 20-21; 2:1-2, 5, 8-9, 11; 4:7, 2-3, 11-14; 9:9; 11:7-13; 14:9, 16-17; 4:9; 6:12-15, 1</H1><P>The book of Zechariah reveals that Christ is wonderful and that He is the centrality and universality of God's economy. But how can we receive such a Christ? The means and the instrument by which we can receive Christ is our human spirit. In this message, therefore, I would like to give a word concerning the human spirit and the Christ unveiled in Zechariah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SISTER VERSES IN ZECHARIAH AND ISAIAH</H2><P>In the books of Zechariah and Isaiah, both of which have much to say about Christ, there are sister verses that speak clearly regarding the human spirit. Zechariah 12:1 says, "Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him." This reveals that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man was created by God with a spirit that he may contact God, receive God, live God, fulfill God's purpose for God, and be one with God.</P><P>Isaiah 42:5 is a sister verse to Zechariah 12:1. "Thus says God Jehovah, / Who created the heavens and stretched them out, / Who spread forth the earth and what springs up from it, / Who gives breath to the people upon it / And spirit to those who walk on it." The Hebrew word translated breath here can also be rendered spirit (cf. Prov. 20:27). These sister verses both mention three matters: the heavens, the earth, and the human spirit. Whereas Zechariah 12:1 speaks of God's forming the human spirit, Isaiah 42:5 simply speaks of God's giving a spirit to man.</P><P>Verse 6 goes on to speak concerning God's purpose in giving man a spirit. "I am Jehovah; I have called You in righteousness; / I have held You by the hand; / I have kept You and I have given You / As a covenant for the people, as a light for the nations." Here we see that God intends to give His Son Christ to us as a covenant and as a light to the nations. Such a Christ is wonderful, but unless we can receive Him, He does not have anything to do with us. In order to receive this Christ, we must have a receiver within us, and this receiver is our human spirit. God has given us a spirit so that we can receive, partake of, participate in, and enjoy Christ as the covenant and as the light.</P>
