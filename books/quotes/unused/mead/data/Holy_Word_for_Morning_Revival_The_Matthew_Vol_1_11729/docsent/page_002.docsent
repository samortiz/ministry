   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Heb 1:1-2 God, having spoken of old in many portions to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matt 1:1 The book of the generation of 1 Jesus 2 Christ, the 3 son of David, the 4 son of Abraham:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 1 The first name and the last name Rev 22:21 in the New Testament is Jesus, proving that Jesus Christ is the subject and content of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ, as the wonderful center of the entire Bible, is all-inclusive, having many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Gospel of Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Gospel of Mark tells us that He is the Servant of God, laboring for God faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Mark's account is most simple, for a servant does not warrant a detailed record.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Gospel of Luke presents a full picture of Him as the only proper and normal man who ever lived on this earth; as such a man, He is the Savior of mankind.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among the four Gospels, Matthew and Luke have a record of genealogy; Mark and John do not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To testify that Jesus is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, Matthew needs to show us the antecedents and status of this King, to prove that He is the proper successor to the throne of David.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To prove that Jesus is a proper and normal man, Luke needs to show the generations of this man, to attest that He is qualified to be the Savior of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the record of a servant, Mark does not need to tell us His origin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To unveil that Jesus is the very God, neither does John need to give us His human genealogy; rather, he declares that, as the Word of God, He is the very God in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1 2 In the genealogy of Jesus given by Luke, which proves that He is a proper man, the title Christ is not mentioned Luke 3:23-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the genealogy of Christ given here by Matthew, which proves that He is the King, the Christ of God, the title Christ is emphasized repeatedly vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1, 16-17 .</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Solomon, as a type of Christ, did mainly two things: he built the temple of God in the kingdom 1 Kings 6:2 and spoke the word of wisdom 1 Kings 10:23-24; Matt 12:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ, in fulfilling this type, is now building the real temple of God, the church, in the kingdom of God and has spoken the word of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1 4 Isaac is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the One who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham Gen 22:17-18; Gal 3:16, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Isaac also, as a type of Christ, did mainly two things: he obeyed his father even unto death and was resurrected from death Gen 22:9-10; Heb 11:19 , and he took Rebekah, a Gentile woman, as his wife Gen 24:61-67 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ, in fulfilling this type, was put to death and offered to God and was resurrected from death, and He is taking the church as His bride out of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible is God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament, God spoke by the prophets, and in the New Testament, He spoke in the Son in the person of the Son, Heb 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With every book of the Bible we need a general sketch.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The general sketch of Matthew is: Christ is Jehovah God incarnated to be the King-Savior who came to establish the kingdom of the heavens the heavenly rule by saving His people from sin of rebellion through His death and resurrection.</S>
