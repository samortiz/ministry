   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Chapter eighteen shows us many other things about Babylon, especially regarding the luxuries she enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning our attitude toward the inventions of science, we can use many things when we have a need.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just as the apostle Paul spoke of using the world 1 Cor 7:31 , our purpose with these things is simply to use them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, luxurious enjoyment is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are some Christians who refuse all luxury and all things which contribute to the enjoyment of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not saying that we should not use certain things at all, but we are saying that anything in excess is luxury.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regardless of whether it is clothing, food, or housing, if it is excessive or beyond our need, it is luxury and in the principle of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God allows all that we need, but He does not permit things which are beyond our necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should order our living according to the principle of need; then God will bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we live according to our own lust, we are in the principle of Babylon, and God will not bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen that the principle of Babylon is mixing the things of man with the Word of God, and the things of the flesh with the things of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is pretending that something of man is something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is receiving man's glory to satisfy man's lust.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, Babylon is mixed and corrupted Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What should our attitude be toward Babylon?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Revelation 18:4 says, "And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second Corinthians 6:17-18 also says, "Therefore 'come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you'; 'and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me.'"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to God's Word, His children cannot be involved in any matter containing the character of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God said that we must come out from every situation where man's power is mixed with God's power, where man's ability is mixed with God's work, and where man's opinion is mixed with God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot partake of anything that has the character of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to come out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's children must learn from the depths of their spirit to separate themselves from Babylon and to judge all her actions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do this, we will not be condemned together with Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Babylon had her beginning in the tower of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Day by day Babylon is becoming larger and larger.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But God will judge her in the end. Revelation 19:1-4 says, "After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For true and righteous are His judgments; for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and He avenged the blood of His slaves at her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And a second time they said, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And her smoke goes up forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When God judges the harlot and shatters all her work, and when He casts out all that she is and the principle she represents, voices from heaven will say, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the New Testament, there are very few hallelujahs, and they are all expressed in this chapter because Babylon, she who adulterated the Word of Christ, has been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The passage in Revelation 18:2-8 tells us the reason for Babylon's fall and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sinful deeds of Babylon are announced and the consequences of her judgment are set forth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All who are of the same mind with God must say, Hallelujah, for God has judged Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Though the actual judgment is in the future, the spiritual judgment must take place today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The actual judgment will be performed by God in the future, but the spiritual judgment must be made by us today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God's children bring many unspiritual things into the church, how do we feel about it?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Does the fact that we are all God's children and the fact that we should love one another mean that we should not say, Hallelujah, to God's judgment?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must realize that this is not a matter of love, but a matter of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The principle of Babylon is confusion and uncleanness; therefore, her name is the harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The few passages in Revelation which God uses to describe Babylon show us His exceeding hatred toward her.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Those who destroy the earth" in Revelation 11:18 are of this woman, of whom it is written in chapter nineteen that she "corrupted the earth" v. 2 .</S>
