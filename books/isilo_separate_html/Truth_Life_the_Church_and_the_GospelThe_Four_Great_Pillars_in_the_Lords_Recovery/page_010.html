IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>A young person who is sloppy at age fifteen will be a foolish person at age eighteen. However, if he is willing to study hard during high school, he can learn many things. If he continues with another four years of college, by age twenty-two he will be more enlightened inwardly and able to teach others. The difference between those who are learned and those who are unlearned is very great. Today those who have a college education are distinguished in society. Thus, even if you are no longer a young person, it would be best for you to go back to school to get a college education if possible. Otherwise, it will be difficult to convince others.</p>
<p>We are certainly happy to see the elderly saints, but it is very difficult for us to demand that they spend more effort to pursue the truth. They love the Lord and also His word. They know Genesis 1:26, realizing that God created man in His own image. They understand Ephesians 1:4, knowing that God chose us in Christ. They are clear about Proverbs 9:10, recognizing that the fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom and that the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. They are able to testify to others, saying, &ldquo;The Bible is very good; it tells us that God created us in His image, that He chose us in Christ, and that today He has become our wisdom.&rdquo; This is more than sufficient. We cannot ask for more. However, if the young people among us were to study the Word in the same way, this would be very disappointing. Why should an eighteen year old study the Word like a sixty-eight year old? That way of studying is not bad, but only for an elderly saint. An eighteen year old must study the Bible utilizing a more in-depth method, just as Solomon said that we should remember our Lord in the days of our youth (Eccl. 12:1). The young people must learn the highest truths while they are in their youth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning God&rsquo;s Creation</h2>
<p>First, the Bible reveals God&rsquo;s creation (Gen. 1&mdash;2). In God&rsquo;s creation there are two important points&mdash;one is the creation of life, and the other is the creation of man. The creation of life is the most unusual aspect of God&rsquo;s creation. People today promote the building up of their countries, but no matter how much building work they do, they can never produce life. At best they can build some robots that resemble man but do not have man&rsquo;s life within. Regardless of how far technology has advanced in producing more and more sophisticated computers, it still does not have the ability to create a living brain. Only God can create life. Genesis chapter one shows us that God firstly created the inanimate objects and then the living things. When He created the living things, God started from the lowest form of life and then progressed to the higher forms of life. This is the process of God&rsquo;s creation of life.</p>
<p>The highest form of the created life is the human life. Human life is the highest life among the lives created by God. This life is one that resembles the life of God; it is a life created according to God&rsquo;s image. God&rsquo;s image is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. Since the human life has God&rsquo;s image, it also has love, light, holiness and righteousness, making it the highest created life. Of course, in the universe there is still a higher life&mdash;the life of God. In the entire universe the highest life is God&rsquo;s life. Therefore, in Genesis chapter two the tree of life depicts God&rsquo;s life. Man was placed before the tree of life, indicating that God wanted man to take Him as the highest life so that man would live out God&rsquo;s life in the human life. This is the truth concerning God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Man&rsquo;s Fall</h2>
<p>Second, the Bible speaks about the fall of man, which is recorded in Genesis chapter three. There are also two important points concerning the fall of man. First, when man fell, there was a charge of sin against him before God, and man became a sinner condemned by God. Second, man now had the sinful nature within him as the result of Satan&rsquo;s coming into man&rsquo;s flesh. Satan tempted man to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This fruit denotes Satan, just as the fruit of the tree of life denotes God. If man had eaten of the tree of life, he would have gained God. However, man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, receiving Satan into his flesh, issuing in the sinful nature being in man&rsquo;s flesh. This sinful nature is called <em>sin</em> in the Bible. Therefore, when man fell, not only was there a charge of sin against him before God, but also the sinful nature was in his flesh.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
