   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Beginning in this message we want to study, to investigate, the Spirit's work on and in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I. SANCTIFYING THE GOD-CHOSEN PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEFORE THEY REPENT AND BELIEVE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first work the Spirit has done with us is to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit sanctifies the God-chosen people before they repent and believe 1 Pet 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not many Christians realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible also reveals that sanctification is after justification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, God justified us by our believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then God continues to work on us by sanctifying us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The book of Romans speaks of this aspect of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first section of the book of Romans, from 1:18 through 3:20, is on God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second section, from 3:21 through 5:11, is on God's justification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the third section, from 5:12 through 8:13, is on sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the very crucial section of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 5 is "in Adam," Romans 6 is "in Christ," Romans 7 is "in the flesh," and Romans 8 is "in the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 6:19 and 22 refer to the sanctification that takes place after our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we also need to see that God sanctifies His chosen people even before they repent and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Peter 1:2 says, "Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a crucial verse in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This verse reveals that there is another step of the Spirit's sanctification before our repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Peter begins with God's choosing, God's selection, in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God knew us in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before we were born, before we were created, before Adam was created, and even before the universe was created, God foreknew us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to God's foreknowledge, He chose us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was like a person coming to a supermarket, looking around at all the items, and choosing the ones that he liked.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He chose each one of us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It would be good to circle the word chosen in our Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How wonderful it is that we have been chosen according to our Father's foreknowledge!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse goes on to say that we were chosen in the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The phrase in the sanctification of the Spirit functions as an adverb to modify the verb chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the grammar, this is one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I say, "I speak with my mouth," this is one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With my mouth modifies the verb speak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God did not choose and sanctify us, but He chose us in the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is also one thing and one action.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We were chosen in eternity past, but we were sanctified in time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But 1 Peter 1:2 links eternity with time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In God, there is no time element.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God chose us and He did it in the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's choosing and the Spirit's sanctification are one action.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then 1 Peter 1:2 says that God's choosing us in the sanctification of the Spirit was "unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Obedience in the New Testament implies two things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, our obedience to God implies our repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then it implies our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We were away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We were His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then the Spirit came to work on us, and this was unto something.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Unto here means "resulting in."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So the Spirit's sanctification results in our repentance and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These two things added together are our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sanctification of the Spirit is unto the obedience of repentance and believing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The real obedience to God is to repent to God and believe into the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Following our obedience, we experience "the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The sprinkling of the blood of Christ came upon us, not before our repentance but after our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God's choosing is first, and this was in the Spirit's sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This resulted in obedience, consisting of repentance and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we are ready to receive God's redemption, and the first step of God's redemption is for Him to sprinkle us with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Without the sprinkling, the washing, of the blood, there is no way for God to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Obedience is on our side, but choosing in sanctification is on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God chose us in eternity, but the working out of the sentence in 1 Peter 1:2 is not finished yet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We were chosen in eternity in the sanctification of the Spirit in time, and this sanctification issues in our repentance and faith, which is our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was ready from eternity to redeem us, but we were not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then we received His Spirit's sanctification, and that resulted in our repentance and faith in God's Son, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now we are ready to receive God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The first thing in His salvation is to sprinkle us with the blood of the Second of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>So we get washed, forgiven, justified, and reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, we can see that before our repentance and faith there was the sanctification by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>First Peter 1:2 shows that the sprinkling of the blood follows the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I hope this brief fellowship shows us the way to study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even a small preposition in the Bible needs our study.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First Peter 1:2 does not say that God chose us through but in the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's choosing could not be practiced without the Spirit's sanctifying.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is the sanctifying of the Spirit that carries out God's choosing.</S>
