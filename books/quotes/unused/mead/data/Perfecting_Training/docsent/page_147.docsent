   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LEADING OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have the divine life, God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The life mentioned in Romans 8 implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It implies residing; it implies life giving; it implies liberating.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It also implies a kind of law with a spontaneous power and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is really hard to define this divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 14 indicates that the matter of leading is here just because we are sons of God living a life under such a lead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The matter of leading implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This has to be the leading that we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to follow such a leading concerning marriage, concerning school, concerning jobs, concerning where to go, where to stay, where to live, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are led by such a leading you are living the life of sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are not living a dog life nor a cat life nor even an ordinary human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You are living a super-resurrected human life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you will check according to your experience you will see that all these matters are present.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The residing, the life giving, the putting to death, the setting of the mind upon the spirit, and the walking according to spirit were there even today in your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why in the morning you behaved yourself in a certain way, and this is why in the evening you talked to your folks in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You were under a kind of wonderful leading that even you could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet you were under it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps even for the whole day you spontaneously lived a life which proves and testifies to the fact that you are a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even to read a message such as this eventually brings you, if not in full, at least to some extent under this leading.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Your life would be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You had no intention to change your life, but it just changed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not just a matter of changing your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, something comes out unconsciously and spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope this matter of leading has been made very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You don t need to spend that much time asking Him to show you His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You just go to praise Him, to worship Him, to offer your best thanksgiving to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you practice seeking His leading, that means you are not under the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are under the lead, you don t need to seek His lead any more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You are simply under His lead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you wake up in the morning you are under the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You just praise Him; you just thank Him; you just have a well speaking with Him and bless Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You just stay with Him to enjoy His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You stay there to enjoy His burden in you to pray for certain things for His Body, for His interest, for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You don t need to ask for His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You are just under a leading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is actually to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This also is to put to death the old creation, the practical flesh, the practices of the mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This spontaneously is the enjoyment of the life giving of the residing Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is just the life of the Triune God residing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is what is revealed in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have to realize that Romans 8 is so experiential, so practical, so deep.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You cannot understand Romans 8 simply in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It speaks of the experience of the Triune God in an experiential way.</S>
