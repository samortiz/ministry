This is what we call the Person and work of Christ. Many people throughout history have not been clear about this matter, so they have developed many heresies (wrong teachings) about Christ's Person and work. Christ is the central figure in God's economy for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose. We must spend some time to study this great truth of the Bible. The Bible is the foundation of all our beliefs. We can never deviate from what it says. Lessons Thirteen through Twenty-Four present the major points about Christ and His work which we see from the pure revelation of the Bible. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CHRIST BEING GOD</H2><P>The first major point about Christ is that He is God, the God of eternity. We should not think that Christ did not exist before His birth at Bethlehem two thousand years ago. For you and me, birth was the beginning; but the Bible tells us that Christ existed before all things (Col. 1:17). Isaiah 9:6 tells us that the One born in the manger was the mighty God and the eternal Father. John 1:1 and 14 tell us that Christ was the Word in the beginning (in eternity past) and that this Word was God. Romans 9:5 says He is "the Christ, Who is over all, God blessed forever."</P><P>Even in the Old Testament, Christ came to His people several times in the form of a man. On one occasion He ate a meal with Abraham (Gen. 18:1-33); on another occasion He wrestled with Jacob (Gen. 32:24-30); and on still another He appeared walking in the midst of a blazing furnace with three of His chosen people (Dan. 3:23-25). Although Christ is not specifically mentioned, we know it was He since He is the expression of God (John 1:18). God dwells in unapproachable light and no one has ever seen Him (1 Tim. 6:16), but in Christ He can be seen. Jacob even wrestled with Him! All of these instances are mysterious. We cannot explain how they were possible. This is why in one of His appearings He said His name is "wonderful" (Judg. 13:18, in Hebrew), which means that it is beyond our ability to understand. Some confused people believe that Christ was a man who later became God. This is heretical; the Bible does not say this. The Bible tells us that Christ is God from eternity past to eternity future.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
