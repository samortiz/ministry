RELATED TO TIME OR PLACE AFFECT OUR PRAYER</h2>
<p>We should not allow circumstances related to time or place affect our prayer. As we learn to exercise our spirit and to pray in spirit, circumstances related to time or place should not hinder us from releasing our spirit in prayer. In the past, we have allowed circumstances of time and place to influence our concepts and our willingness to pray. Although many brothers and sisters realize the need to fellowship with God by praying in spirit, they do not see that they allow their fellowship and prayer to be affected by considerations related to time or place. Our exercise should not change simply because we are by ourselves or because we are with other brothers and sisters. Our exercise in the prayer meeting should be the same as our exercise in our morning time with the Lord. If we allow circumstances of time and place to affect our prayers, we will encounter many situations in which our spirit is closed.</p>
<p>For example, when we attend a message meeting, we often have a concept that only the brother who is giving the message and the brothers who are leading the Scripture reading and singing need to pray, because we are there only to listen to a message. Thus, from the very beginning, our spirit is closed and our mind does not consider the matter of prayer. Sometimes we even behave in this way in the prayer meeting. Some brothers and sisters come to the prayer meeting determined not to pray. One brother may feel ashamed to pray because he did something in the flesh. Another brother may feel he should not pray because he is a new believer, who has little experience of praying and who is not familiar with the Bible. A sister may feel exhausted from her busy day and be willing to let others pray, while she only says Amen. Another sister may feel that it is not her place to pray. When many brothers and sisters do not open their mouths, the entire meeting is heavy and dead.</p>
<p>We must turn this around. From this time forward, we must learn to pray at every time in spirit (Eph. 6:18), regardless of the situation. As long as there is an opportunity, we should pray; we should seize every opportunity to pray. Whenever we arrive at a meeting, we should begin to pray. We should begin to pray no matter how many people are present and whether or not it is time to begin the meeting. It is not necessary to begin with singing. We can pray until there is a sense to call a hymn. If it is a familiar hymn, we do not even have to call the number; we can simply begin to sing, and others will spontaneously follow. In this way, the meeting will be very living.</p>
<p>Presently, our meetings are very rigid. We wait until it is the meeting time before we begin. We sing a hymn first, but the singing often is without much life or dead. Then a responsible brother prays in a perfunctory manner. When no one uses his spirit, the meeting falls entirely into formality and ritual. Frankly, this dead formality in a meeting is tiresome. We must drastically change the way we meet. We should not focus on changing outward things; rather, we should focus on strengthening the exercise of the spirit in the meeting. We must exercise to the extent that our spirit can come forth at any time and at any place. When we go to a meeting, whether it is a message meeting, a bread-breaking meeting, or a prayer meeting, we should be able to use our spirit to pray.</p>
<p>A brother recently said to me, &ldquo;We have been blending in spirit for several weeks now. Is this enough?&rdquo; I smiled and said, &ldquo;We need to blend in spirit until the Lord comes back.&rdquo; We must blend continually, until the brothers and sisters can release their spirits to pray regardless of time and place. We must be able to use our spirit to contact God and worship Him as soon as we arrive at a meeting. Furthermore, our worship should involve worshipping in one spirit with all the saints. All the saints should be released in spirit. We should blend in spirit with others, and we should enliven the spirit of others. If we practice these matters, the whole church will advance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACTIVELY EXERCISING THE SPIRIT TO PRAY</h2>
<p>We have also been influenced by the erroneous concept that we need to wait for inspiration before praying. Hence, some who come to the meeting are waiting for inspiration from the beginning until the end of the meeting. If someone asks a saint why he did not pray, he will say, &ldquo;I was not inspired to pray.&rdquo; This word may sound very spiritual, but it is not practical. If a soccer player does not kick the ball when he is on the field, claiming a lack of inspiration, his explanation will not be taken seriously. What is the purpose of a player being on the field if not to kick the ball? If he is on the field, he should kick the ball. When the ball comes to him, &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; should not even be a consideration. Similarly, if the ball does not come to him, he should actively seek an opportunity to kick the ball. When we come to a meeting, we should be focused on worshipping God in spirit. Hence, when we come to a meeting, we should use our spirit and actively look for opportunities to pray. We should not come to a meeting and keep our mouth closed because we have a lack of &ldquo;inspiration.&rdquo; Just as a soccer player should kick the ball when he is on the field, we should exercise our spirit in the meeting.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
