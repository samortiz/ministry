   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Six Stone Waterpots</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before doing the miracle, the Lord told the people to fill the waterpots with water 2:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These water containers, made of stone, were six in number.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The number six represents created man, because it was on the sixth day that man was created Gen 1:27, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the six stone waterpots signify the natural man who was created on the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Naturally speaking, we are nothing but waterpots, vessels to contain something.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We, the waterpots, were located in Cana, the land of reeds, full of weak and fragile people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were the waterpots in Cana, weak and fragile.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Jewish Rites of Purification with Water</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The waterpots were used in the Jewish rites of purification 2:6 , a practice of the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Jewish rites of purification with water signify religion s attempt to make people clean by certain dead practices.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ancient Jews took care of washing themselves and of keeping themselves clean and pure in God s worship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord, on the contrary, changes death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ritual purification with water is outward, without life, but the Lord s changing death into life is from within and is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fill the Waterpots with Water</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord told the servants to fill the waterpots with water, and they filled them up to the brim 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we shall see, it signifies that human beings are filled with death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The waterpots, that is, mankind created on the sixth day, are filled with the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>C. Jesus Changing Their Death into Life Eternal 1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Water, Signifying Death</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord commanded the people to fill the six vessels with water, it indicated that the natural man is full of death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Water in the Scriptures has two symbolic meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In some cases it stands for life John 4:14; 7:38 ; in others, death Gen 1:2, 6; Exo 14:21; Matt 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The waters in Genesis 1 and the water of baptism signify death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this instance, water also signifies death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the stone vessels were full of water, meaning that all humanity is naturally full of death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Just as the waterpots were filled to the brim with water, so we were filled with death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Wine as the Life-juice of the Grape,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Signifying Life</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus marvelously changed this death water into wine 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This miracle not only shows that the Lord Jesus can call things not being as being Rom 4:17 , but also that He can change death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord s miraculously changing water into wine signifies that He changes our death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The water signifies death, and the wine signifies life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord changes our water into wine, that wine in our marriage feast will never end. Since we have been regenerated, life with its spiritual enjoyment will last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We shall have an eternal marriage feast which will never end. This feast is not in our original life, but in the new life which we received through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even as the ruler of the feast discovered that the new wine is better than the former wine 2:9-10 , so we too shall find that the life we receive through regeneration is much better than our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our former life, symbolized by the poor wine, was greatly inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord did not give us the best first, but the best last.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first life, the human, created one, is an inferior life; the best life is the second life, the divine and everlasting one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This life is the best because it is the life of God Himself in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So, our pleasure will last forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have everlasting enjoyment, for Christ has translated us from death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He, as our everlasting, eternal life, can maintain our pleasures and enjoyment forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A new marriage feast began when we were saved, and it will never end. There is always joy within and there is always a marriage feast within because we have the divine wine, which is the divine life the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before we were saved, we were waterpots filled with death water.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One day we said, Lord Jesus, and He came and changed our death water into life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regardless of the kind of death situation we might be in, if we turn our case over to the Lord Jesus, He will change that death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, even Christian husbands and wives may reach a point in their married life that the life runs out of their marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It seems that they are unable to go on in their married life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, if they open to the Lord Jesus, He will change that death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In many marriages the Lord has changed death water into life wine.</S>
