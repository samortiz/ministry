We pray that You will release Yourself from Your Word. We all desire to hear You, to see You, and to gain something from You. Lord, we place ourselves before You to receive Your enlightenment and penetration. We pray that You will expose our true condition, that in Your light we may know ourselves as we know You. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S ORIGINAL INTENTION&#151;<br>THAT EVERYONE BE A PRIEST</H2><P>In this meeting I would like to fellowship with you concerning several portions of the Word which are very fundamental and practical, and with which we need to check our service and work today, that we may be clear about the way to go on.</P><P>Romans 15:16 says, "So that I might be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, a laboring priest of the gospel of God, in order that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit." To labor is to not be lazy but to be industrious; it includes striving, expending great effort, and endeavoring to go on by struggling. This can be likened to the endeavoring of the ancient Greek Olympic athletes. Unfortunately, most of the English versions do not include the word "laboring"; some render this portion only as "serving as a priest of the gospel of God." We know that all New Testament believers are priests, but five years ago we did not point out what the New Testament priests do. What the priests of the Old Testament did was mostly to offer sacrifices and handle the offerings, but what do the priests of the New Testament do?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRODUCING OF THE PRIESTLY TRIBE OF LEVI</H2><P>In Exodus 19 God called the children of Israel, saying, "Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation" (vv. 5-6a). In the beginning, God's ordination was that all the people of Israel would be priests. However, not long after that, they worshipped the golden calf and blasphemed God. This caused Moses to shatter the stone tablets and to charge the people to stand on God's side and slay their brothers. At that time, only the Levites did as Moses had asked (32:25-29). Then, in Deuteronomy 33:8-9 God blessed Levi through Moses, saying, "May Your Thummim and Urim be with Your godly man...he who said of his father and mother, I do not regard him; and his brothers he did not acknowledge, and his children he did not recognize; for they have kept Your speaking and have guarded Your covenant." From then on, only the Levites could be priests, and a nation of priests became a tribe of priests. Furthermore, only the house of Aaron could be priests; the rest of the Levites were only the serving ones. Then, in Numbers 16 the rebellion of Korah and his company took place because they were not content to remain in a secondary position in the service. So Moses rebuked them, saying, "Hear now, you sons of Levi: Is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the assembly to minister to them...And will you seek the priesthood also?" (vv. 8-10). This shows that the children of Israel in the Old Testament were divided into three classes: the priesthood of the house of Aaron, the serving Levites, and the common people.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
