<p>Our spiritual results are poor because we do not exercise our spirit, even though we have many meetings, give many messages, and have many activities. We are trying to build up our work with meetings, messages, and activities but not through the exercise of our spirit. This is the reason for our lack of results. For example, in hall one, after the message meeting, the saints pray in small groups, and I have participated in some of these small groups. If there are seven or eight saints in a small group, three or four are reluctant to pray; their voices even sound as if they were sick. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand the words of their prayer. We have practiced praying in small groups after a message meeting for three to four months, but the situation has not changed. In every group there are always two or three who are released to pray. These are the same ones who pray in the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting. They always pray. In the small groups their prayers are fluent and strong, and their spirit is released. Hence, even in the small groups, some almost always pray, and some almost never pray.</p>
<p>We must come back to God&rsquo;s Word and consider our work; that is, we need to consider what God&rsquo;s goal is for the saints. Is it for them to be in meetings, for them to listen to messages, or for them to be involved in some service? Rather than just this, we must bring them into the dwelling place of God in spirit; this is God&rsquo;s ultimate goal. We must admit that the spiritual result of our work is poor. We began more than ten years ago in Taipei, laboring in many meetings and giving many messages, but only a small number of saints are living and released in spirit. We have not brought the saints into the spirit. After considering and analyzing our work in these days, I have no other burden.</p>
<p>This is the situation not only in our district meetings, but even in our co-workers&rsquo; meetings. Some co-workers attend the co-workers&rsquo; meeting throughout the year but never pray, and some elders attend the elders&rsquo; meeting regularly but never pray. We must realize that the way of our leading determines the kind of fruit that we bear. In the past, our work consisted of meetings, messages, and service activities. We did many things, but we were very short of prayer. Since we did not pray, the saints under our care did not pray either. People can only produce children who have their same racial and ethnic traits. If we rarely pray in spirit, how can we produce people who pray in spirit? We say that the work in Christianity only brings people to a Sunday service, but we should ask ourselves, &ldquo;Where are we bringing the saints? Are we bringing them into the spirit? Have we caused them to be enlivened in the spirit?&rdquo; If we look at the results of our work, it should cause us to be in fear and trembling. We have not brought many saints into the spirit, and there are not many whose spirit has been enlivened as a result of our service and work.</p>
<p>In a recent elders&rsquo; meeting I fellowshipped that we should not bring up any matter to discuss in our times of fellowship but, instead, that we should pray more. We should pray, and we should even fast and pray. Looking at the results of the past decade, we should no longer do things according to the old way. The elders truly need to pray. In the past the brothers surely endeavored to labor, but laboring according to our old way is not enough; we need to exercise our spirit more. We must study how to lead the saints to worship in spirit in the meetings so that they will not merely come to attend a meeting and listen to a message. In the past we emphasized inviting people to the meetings and listening to messages, but we did not lead them to exercise their spirit to serve and worship. This is why so few of them can exercise their spirit to serve and worship. Many of the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones in the districts have not been delivered from the concept of just attending meetings and listening to messages; consequently, few really serve in spirit. We are used to having meetings and listening to messages, but we do not have the concept of exercising our spirit to serve in the meeting. When we come to a meeting, we should exercise our spirit to serve, worship, pray, and praise. We must change our concept.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING PEOPLE TO PRAY AND SERVE IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Many who participate in the service meetings feel that they are merely coming to another meeting; few have the concept that they must exercise their spirit to serve and worship. Formerly, we were not clear concerning our lack, but now that we are clear, we should no longer merely give messages, listen to messages, or labor in activities; we need service that is in spirit. Our goal is not to just bring people to the meetings, because meetings are not our ultimate destination. We must lead people into the spirit, because a dwelling place in spirit is our ultimate destination. We should not bring people just to listen to a message, but we must bring them into the spirit.</p>
<p>If we desire to bring people into the spirit, we must exercise our spirit and pray; this is the key. If we use our mind, we will bring people into their mind, and if we use our emotions, we will bring people into their emotions. We can bring people only to the place where we are. Thus, if we use our spirit, we will bring people into the spirit. Although the saints have been attending many meetings, we rarely bring them into the spirit. As a consequence, their spiritual growth has been very slow, and their spiritual insight has not progressed. The saints can experience spiritual growth, receive spiritual enlightenment, and be delivered from sins only when they touch God in spirit. If we continue to meet, give messages, and serve in activities without bringing the saints into the spirit, we cannot expect them to touch God in their spirit.</p>
<p>A message without the Spirit is mere doctrine, and a message not spoken in spirit is mere letter. Such a message cannot touch the human spirit, and if a person is not in spirit, he cannot be enlightened or touched by God while listening to a message. Only a person who fellowships with God in spirit can be enlightened inwardly to see his sins, corruption, flesh, natural man, and natural disposition. Only a person who contacts the Spirit in his spirit and is touched by God can have real knowledge and real growth.</p>
<p>Our knowledge and experience of the Lord should not be merely doctrinal. For example, both <em>Hymns,</em> #78 and #510 speak of various items of the riches of Christ, but if we commit these items only to our memory, we are increasing only our mental knowledge, not our experience of Christ. Christ can never be experienced in our mind through doctrines. We must touch the Spirit in our spirit and allow the word of God, the living word of God, to enlighten us. This is the way to genuinely touch the riches of Christ. We need to know the riches of Christ in reality. Every real experience of Christ depends on touching the Spirit in our spirit, not on doctrines.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 63</div><br></body></html>
