   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLY CITY Holy Separated unto God and Saturated with God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Jerusalem is also designated as the holy city Rev 21:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament the word holy does not only mean separated unto God but also saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Old Testament to be made holy is to be separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no saturation of God in the Old Testament, and the holiness or sanctification there is only positional, not dispositional.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament, though, we see both the objective, positional holiness and sanctification and the subjective dispositional holiness and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 6:19 and 22 indicate that sanctification is something subjective and dispositional.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament a piece of gold could be made holy and sanctified by changing its position, by putting it in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church today is made holy not only positionally, though, but also dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1 Thessalonians 5:23 Paul prays that our whole being, spirit and soul and body, may be sanctified wholly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is dispositional sanctification where the very holy God is saturating us with His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In positional sanctification there is only a change of position, but in dispositional sanctification there is the transformation in nature and in element.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the New Jerusalem is not merely holy in the sense of the Old Testament but in the sense of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Based upon this principle, we can see that the holy city, the New Jerusalem, could never be a physical city since a physical city could never be saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This city is composed with living persons who can be and who are saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The New Jerusalem is not merely a city separated unto God, but it is also a city saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the old Jerusalem and in the old temple we can see the separation but not the saturation with God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament, however, the church is God s temple 1 Cor 3:16 and this temple is not only separated unto God but also saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The New Jerusalem is not the Old Testament city but the New Testament city a city saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A City to Which We Have Come</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I studied Hebrews 11:14-16 as a young believer, I thought that these verses indicated that the New Jerusalem was a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These verses tell us that the Old Testament saints longed after a better country, a heavenly country, and that God had prepared for them a city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Hebrews 12:22, however, the writer tells us that we have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This verse does not say that we will come but that we have come to the heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If Mount Zion and the city of the living God were something physical, how could we have come to them even today?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Also, this verse does not say that Jerusalem is in the heavens but that it is the heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This city is heavenly in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have received a heavenly call Heb 3:1 , have tasted the heavenly gift Heb 6:4 , and can live a heavenly life on earth today Col 3:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hebrews 12:22 clearly indicates that the heavenly Jerusalem is not a physical city because we have already come to this heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians are waiting to go to the New Jerusalem, but we must realize that we have come to the New Jerusalem already.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fact that we have already come to the New Jerusalem and the fact that the New Jerusalem is called the heavenly Jerusalem rescued me from my old concept.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church is the house of the living God so it is God s home and it is also our home today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the church is enlarged to be a city, it becomes a heavenly country.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our heavenly country is a city to which we have already come.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Designed and Built by God</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This city was designed and built by God Heb 11:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hebrews 11:10 tells us that the Architect and Maker of this city is God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Greek word for architect in this verse can also be translated as either builder or artificer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that God is a skillful designer and a top craftsman.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not logical to think that our living God designed a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 2:10 tells us that the church is God s masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Greek word for masterpiece is poiema which means something which has been written or composed as a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church is a poem written by God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Poetry expresses the writer s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God makes known through the church His multifarious wisdom Eph 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The New Jerusalem, as the ultimate consummation of the church, is full of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God designed the New Jerusalem with His wisdom and this city displays His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To say that the New Jerusalem is a physical city depreciates God s wisdom and belittles this eternal, wise Architect.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we have the realization that the New Jerusalem is a sign which signifies many spiritual, divine things, then we begin to see the wisdom of God in this city.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God is a wise designer and artificer who designed such a city to be a full manifestation of His multifarious wisdom.</S>
