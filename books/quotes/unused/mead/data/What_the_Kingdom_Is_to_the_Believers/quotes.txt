[1]  CHAPTER ONE WHAT THE KINGDOM IS TO THE BELIEVERS 1 RIGHTEOUSNESS, PEACE, AND JOY
[2]  IN THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Matt 3:1-2; 4:17; 5:3, 10, 19-20; 9:35; 24:14; Mark 1:14; Luke 4:43; 17:20-21; John 3:3, 5; Acts 1:3; 8:12; 14:22; 20:24-25; 28:31; Rom 14:17; Eph 5:5; Col 1:13; 2 Thes 1:5; 2 Tim 4:18; 2 Pet 1:11; Rev 1:9; 11:15; 20:4b, 6b; 22:5b
[3]  In this book we will consider the matter of the kingdom of God in a specific and systematic way.
[4]  In Luke 4:43 the Lord Jesus said, I must announce the gospel of the kingdom of God.
[5]  In the Gospel of Matthew the kingdom of God is called the kingdom of the heavens ; elsewhere it is called the heavenly kingdom 2 Tim 4:18 .
[6]  Rather, almost every book in the New Testament speaks of the kingdom of God and says clearly that the central goal of the gospel is the kingdom of God.
[7]  Acts also says that the gospel they announced was the gospel of the kingdom of God v. 12; 14:22 . Even Paul himself said that his testifying of the gospel of the grace of God was his proclaiming of the kingdom; therefore, the kingdom of God is the content of the gospel of God 20:24-25 . The last verse in the book of Acts says that the apostle Paul was proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness 28:31 .
[8]  From God s perspective we were formerly in Satan s kingdom, which is the authority of darkness, but God has delivered us out of the kingdom of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.
[9]  After reading these words in the New Testament, we can clearly see that the goal of God s gospel and God s salvation is to save us into the kingdom.
[10]  The goal of the gospel of God is not the forgiveness of sins or life but the kingdom.
[11]  However, the Bible repeatedly reveals that the central, primary, and most important goal of the gospel of God is the kingdom of God.
[12]  Therefore, all the riches of salvation given to us by God are for one thing to bring us into His kingdom that we may live in this kingdom.
[13]  The reason that God forgives us of our sins, cleanses us, gives us life, sends His Spirit into us, and makes us cleansed and enlivened persons is to save us into His kingdom, to place us in His kingdom, that we may live in this kingdom.
[14]  After His resurrection the Lord Jesus spent forty days speaking to His disciples the things concerning the kingdom of God Acts 1:3 .
[15]  Usually, the things God wants us to know are clearly revealed in the Bible, but sometimes it seems that God wants to give us a difficult time.
[16]  This kingdom the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit Rom 14:17 .
[17]  These three matters righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit speak of how we should deal with ourselves and with others and of our proper relationship with God under the kingdom s ruling.
[18]  CHAPTER TWO WHAT THE KINGDOM IS TO THE BELIEVERS 2 SUBMITTING TO THE RULING OF THE HEAVENS Scripture Reading: Rev 1:4b-6; 5:9-10; 4:2-5; 5:6; 1:14; Matt 12:28; Luke 17:20-21 THE BELIEVERS BEING THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[19]  Revelation 1 and 5 reveal that the Lord has purchased us by His blood to make us His kingdom.
[20]  The word kingdom in 1:6 and 5:10 is rendered citizens in the Chinese Union Version.
[21]  The reason God saves us through the gospel is to bring us into His kingdom.
[22]  In this chapter we will go on to see from the book of Revelation that in saving us through the blood of Jesus, God desires not only to transfer us into His kingdom but also to make us His kingdom.
[23]  In other words, in God s eyes, we saved ones are not only saved into His kingdom but also constituted to be His kingdom.
[24]  It seems that God s authority can be carried out in heaven but not on earth, for there is no one on earth who is willing to submit to God s authority.
[25]  After being saved, we all sense One within us who is directing us.
[26]  In the same way, every saved person has a measure of the kingdom within him.
[27]  In the Lord s table meeting we often hear the saints offer praises, praying, Lord, we thank and praise You for putting Your life in us.
[28]  However, I have never heard a brother or a sister say, Lord, we thank and praise You for bringing Your throne into our being.
[29]  If we have a proper feeling regarding our salvation and see the kingdom clearly, we will say to the Lord, Lord, we thank and praise You because not only have You given Your life to us, but You have also brought Your throne into our being.
[30]  The kingdom is a crucial truth in the Bible.
[31]  If we truly know the Bible, we will realize that the entire story of God in the universe is a story of ruling, that is, a story of obtaining a kingdom.
[32]  It is easy to see that for a great person to fulfill his desire and manifest his glory, he must possess authority and acquire a kingdom.
[33]  If he cannot acquire a kingdom and exercise his authority in it, he will have no way to carry out his plans and show forth his glory.
[34]  The Lord prayed, Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory v. 13 . Daniel 7:14 also puts these three items together, saying that the Son of Man was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom from God.
[35]  Without a kingdom, God has no way to exercise His authority; without the exercise of His authority, God has no way to fulfill His desire; and without the fulfillment of His desire, God has no way to express His honor and glory.
[36]  The Lord continued, Your kingdom come v. 10a , and then went on to pray, Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth v. 10b . This shows that the carrying out of God s will is a matter of the exercise of His authority.
[37]  God became a man in the Son and entrusted all His authority to the Son.
[38]  He did not want the Jews to think that the kingdom of God was here or there ; actually, the kingdom of God was in their midst v. 21 . He Himself was the kingdom of God.
[39]  Apart from Christ man cannot find the kingdom of God, apart from Him man cannot touch the authority of God, and apart from Him there is no throne of God.
[40]  At that time the Lord Jesus heard God say to Him, You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You v. 7 . This is the word God spoke to His Son in His resurrection.
[41]  Thus, in Acts 2, on the day of Pentecost, Peter stood up and said, Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified v. 36 . The authority, the kingdom, and the throne have been given to the Lord; He has been enthroned, and everything pertaining to the kingdom rests with Him.
[42]  After the Holy Spirit had entered into the disciples and had been poured out upon them, He testified in them and led them to know that the Lord was on the throne, that God s kingdom was with Him, and that God s authority was in His hands.
[43]  There is no way for us to receive the Lord and yet set aside His authority.
[44]  We should not say to the Lord, I am too small to contain You, Lord, much less to contain Your throne.
[45]  Neither should we tell Him, Lord, I want only life and peace; I do not want the kingdom and authority.
[46]  They have a mysterious life and a mysterious Savior, and they also have a mysterious kingdom.
[47]  There is a strong thought concerning the kingdom in the Word of God.
[48]  If we read through the Scriptures carefully, we will see that from beginning to end God desires to obtain a sphere for His reign.
[49]  He also said, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God v. 5 . God s kingdom is a matter of God s reign; man s regeneration is a matter of man s receiving God s life.
[50]  However, the requirements of the kingdom are not meant to be met and fulfilled by us; they are to be met and fulfilled by God s life.
[51]  The requirements of the kingdom speak forth how able God is; the requirements of the law, on the other hand, speak forth how impotent man is.
[52]  The Lord Jesus said, Only with difficulty will a rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens...It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God 19:23-24 .
[53]  God s Word says, Everyone who believes into Him the Lord Jesus may have eternal life John 3:15 ; he who has the Son has the life 1 John 5:12 ; and unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God John 3:3 .
[54]  It may be that some do not fully understand the Lord s word regarding this matter.
[55]  Many Christians confess that not long after they were saved, the Spirit of the Lord Jesus asked them to allow Him to have room in them.
[56]  However, when they had this inward sense to allow the Lord Jesus to have room and reign in them, they began to consider the cost, fearing what would happen once they gave themselves to the Lord and He truly reigned in them.
[57]  Through His Son s dying for man, being raised from the dead, cleansing away man s sins with His blood, and regenerating man with His life, God brings His throne, His authority, and His kingdom into the saved ones so that they may have His authority in them and become His kingdom.
[58]  Although they all have God s life, the Lord Himself, and the Lord s throne, authority, and kingdom in them, many will not submit to the Lord s authority, allow the Lord to be seated on the throne within them, or allow Him to establish His kingdom and obtain His domain in their being.
[59]  Some brothers and sisters ask the Lord for help not only in spiritual things but also in material things in their living.
[60]  Rather, we should seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all the things we need will be added to us v. 33 . Many times God is merciful to us, but often He grants us His mercy without much joy.
[61]  He takes care of us, but He is not happy, because we completely disregard His authority, we do not care for His kingdom, and we do not allow Him to be the Lord.
[62]  Rather, when she goes home, she should prostrate herself before the Lord, give herself to Him, acknowledge His authority, receive His throne, allow Him to reign in her and obtain His domain in her, yield her inner being to Him completely, and say to Him, Lord, from today on I am Your kingdom, Your domain.
[63]  Revelation is a book concerning the kingdom 1:6, 9 .
[64]  In order for the kingdom of Christ to come to the earth, there must first be a group of overcomers.
[65]  In Matthew 28 the Lord said, Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you v. 20 . Those who keep the Lord s works until the end are the overcomers who will shepherd the nations with an iron rod.
[66]  Verses 10 through 12 say, I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night.
[67]  When the Lord Jesus taught us how to pray, He particularly charged us to pray for the coming of the kingdom, because the fulfillment of God s desire depends on the coming of the kingdom Matt 6:9-13 .
[68]  After the Lord ministered on earth for three and a half years, prior to His crucifixion He indicated in Luke 19 that His going was for Him to receive a kingdom v. 12 . He was soon to depart from the earth, but His going was that He might receive a kingdom and return.
[69]  He had to go in order to bring the kingdom of God s reign formally to the earth.
[70]  He said that one day He would receive His kingdom and return; that day of the Lord s return will be the day of His second coming.
[71]  God has given the kingdom to the Lord; God the Father has given to the Son all authority in heaven and on earth.
[72]  Perhaps after receiving the Lord, we did not hear a message on the kingdom, but inside us there was always a feeling that Someone was asking, Do you love Me?
[73]  The Lord Jesus has purchased us back with His blood that we may be His obedient people, those who submit to His authority, who are His kingdom, and who allow Him to set up His throne to rule and reign in us.
[74]  We need to see the reason God saves us; that is, we need to see His purpose in saving us.
[75]  CHAPTER SIX WHAT THE KINGDOM IS TO THE BELIEVERS 6 ALLOWING CHRIST TO RULE AS OUR KING Scripture Reading: Matt 28:18-20; Luke 14:26-27, 33; Matt 7:21-23 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
[76]  God s Word reveals that He has given the kingdom, the authority, and the glory to His Son.
[77]  God s Son, the Lord Jesus, has completed everything pertaining to the receiving of the kingdom and the exercising of authority.
[78]  The gospel that the Lord sent His disciples to preach is the gospel of the kingdom, which is to bring people to Him and make them His disciples that they may be led, trained, taught, dealt with, and ruled by Him in His kingdom.
[79]  Luke 14 records that when many came to follow the Lord Jesus, He said to them that if anyone does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and even his own soul-life, he cannot be His disciple v. 26 . The Lord did not say that he is unworthy to be His disciple but that he cannot be His disciple.
[80]  Because the Lord s desire is for us to be His kingdom and be trained under His authority, after we have become believers, we must learn to submit to His authority in order to become His disciples.
[81]  Everyone in the world is created by God and governed by Him.
[82]  Now God has given the kingdom, authority, and glory to His Son, has made Him King, has anointed Him to be the Christ, and has given all authority to Him that He may receive the kingdom and rule and reign.
[83]  This is what God did and declared to the universe in the resurrection and ascension of the Lord Jesus.
[84]  The Lord Jesus revealed in a parable that when He would be raised from the dead and would be about to receive the kingdom, the people on earth would declare, We do not want this man to reign over us v. 14 . In the past two thousand years, in all of world history with all the experiences of mankind, men have been continually declaring, We do not want Jesus to be our King; we want to be kings.
[85]  NEEDING TO BE RULED IN ORDER TO BE DISCIPLES
[86]  In the past years there have been many who did good things and served the Lord but were unruly.
[87]  They reasoned, As long as it is a good thing, we can do it.
[88]  However, as disciples of the Lord today, we should not ask merely whether a certain thing is good or evil, right or wrong.
[89]  Rather, we should ask, Do I do this because of the Lord s ruling in me?
[90]  The living of the people in the world today declares that they do not want the Lord to reign over them, but we should be an anti-testimony, expressing in our living that we allow the Lord to reign, that we submit to His authority, and that we are absolutely ruled by Him.
[91]  THREE PRACTICES OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE Being an Anti-testimony to the World
[92]  Today we should live a life as an anti-testimony to the world.
[93]  We should not only go against the worldly trend, but we should also go against the worldly and degraded condition of all of Christianity.
[94]  However, we saved ones must be an anti-testimony on the earth and allow the Lord Jesus to be our King to rule and reign over us.
[95]  Although the world rebels against Him and rejects His reigning, we should be able to say, Lord, come to us, reign over us, and reign in us.
[96]  Furthermore, if today we truly live in the kingdom and are the Lord s disciples, we will do all that we can and spend all that we have to preach the gospel, to bring people under the authority of the gospel, and to make them the Lord s disciples.
[97]  May the Lord be gracious to us that today we will allow Him to reign, will be His kingdom, will allow Him to rule, and will allow Him to judge, so that on that day we can reign with Him and enjoy the blessing of His eternal presence.
[98]  TO DEAL WITH SATAN Scripture Reading: Matt 25:14-30; 1 Cor 3:10-15; 4:4-5; 2 Cor 5:9-11a; 1 Pet 4:17a; Rev 1:13-17a; 22:12 MAN STANDING IN THE POSITION OF A CREATURE
[99]  In the previous chapters we saw that God desires that His Son gain a kingdom on earth.
[100]  God desires that His Son reign, yet Satan constantly rebels against God.
[101]  If a brother today submits to God s authority in the same way that Job did, the events that took place in heaven in the book of Job will be repeated; Satan will again go before God to argue with Him.
[102]  Revelation 12 says that Satan is the one who accuses our brothers before God day and night v. 10b . In the Old Testament age Satan spoke of Job before God in such a way; likewise, today in the New Testament age Satan still accuses our brothers before God.
[103]  You were created by Me, and you rebel against Me. Adam s descendants were created by Me, and they too rebel against Me. These Christians have been redeemed and regenerated by Me, and they also rebel against Me. What else can I say? If this were the case, how could God s kingdom come? How could God deal with and get rid of His enemy, the rebellious Satan? There would be absolutely no way.
[104]  When the man-child is fully formed within the woman, God will be able to judge the world and bring in His kingdom through His judgment.
[105]  I have no intention to speak a threatening word, but I would like to say that we, as God s children, should never think that today we can behave in any way or live however we want.
[106]  I do not wish to threaten anyone, but I must speak the word of God in an honest way.
[107]  When He comes, God will judge not only our conduct but also our service.
[108]  We cannot say that we are not saved, that we do not have the Lord s life, or that we do not have the Holy Spirit.
[109]  ACCORDING TO HIS ADMINISTRATION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 9:24-27; Phil 3:10-16; 2 Tim 4:6-8, 1-2, 18a
[110]  The Bible shows not only that God grants us His grace but even more that God has an administration toward us.
[111]  God has an administration toward the entire universe and the whole human race, and much more toward His children and His house, His church.
[112]  The third step of God s administration is discipline, or chastisement.
[113]  After we are saved, we should love our wives and treat others with meekness under God s ruling.
[114]  The Holy Spirit gives us the feeling that if we do not treat our family with meekness, we are rebelling against God s rule.
[115]  Paul saw this vision, knew this matter, and understood that this was serious.
[116]  The kingdom is the sphere for the reigning of the heavens.
[117]  However, because Satan s work came in and caused complications, today the kingdom has three aspects its reality, its appearance, and its manifestation.
[118]  The third parable speaks of the expansion and enlargement of the appearance of Christendom Matt 13:31-32 .
[119]  An herb is not only small but also annual, indicating that the church is small and that it sojourns on the earth, that is, that it is transitory.
[120]  In the fifth parable the Lord said, The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field v. 44 . The field here refers to the world in the positive sense; it signifies the earth that God created and desires to gain for His kingdom.
[121]  According to the Old Testament, a treasure refers to the wealth of a nation, as seen in King Hezekiah s showing all the treasures of the kingdom of Judah to the envoys sent by the king of Babylon 2 Kings 20:13 .
[122]  The treasure hidden in the field signifies God s authority, that is, the kingdom, hidden on the earth that God created and desires to gain.
[123]  This shows that the reason God created the earth is to gain the earth so that He may have the ground to rule on the earth and establish His kingdom.
[124]  It was fulfilled in chapter 12 when the Lord cast out demons by the power of the Holy Spirit, showing the coming of the authority of the kingdom, yet the Jews said that He cast out the demons by the ruler of the demons v. 24 . Hence, the Lord said that they would not be forgiven v. 32 . From that time on, the Lord made a break with them and put them outside the kingdom.
[125]  The sixth parable is the parable of the pearl.
[126]  We have seen that the treasure refers to the kingdom that God desires to obtain on the earth.
[127]  The pearl refers to the church as the life pulse of the kingdom.
[128]  In the seventh parable in Matthew 13 the Lord said that the kingdom of the heavens is like a net cast into the sea and gathering from every species v. 47 . This shows that there is not only the pearl in the sea but also every species.
[129]  CHAPTER TEN THE APPEARANCE AND THE MANIFESTATION OF THE KINGDOM 2 THE PROPHECY OF THE KINGDOM
[130]  As a continuation of the previous chapter, this chapter concerns the prophecy concerning the kingdom based on Matthew 24 and 25.
[131]  Every Christian has a responsibility before the Lord in these two aspects life and service.
[132]  After the Lord s ascension and before His second coming, the responsibility He leaves with us during the time He allows us to remain on earth is only of these two aspects life and work.
[133]  To be watchful and prepared is to be filled with the Holy Spirit and mature in life that we may expect the Lord s appearing; to be faithful means to fulfill the stewardship that the Lord has apportioned to us.
[134]  Regarding the believers responsibility in the aspect of work, if chapters 24 and 25 are examined together, they will reveal what it means to be faithful.
[135]  Chapter 25 reveals that to be faithful is to properly use the gifts that the Lord has given us; chapter 24 shows that to be faithful is to give food to those in the Lord s household at the proper time, which means to give food to the church, to care for the needs of the brothers and sisters and minister to them at the proper time.
[136]  If the gift that the Lord has given us is in material riches, we should give according to the Lord s leading in this matter; if our gift is to visit people, we should follow the Lord s leading to visit the saints according to their needs.
[137]  After the Lord has completely finished with the church age, He will come with His overcomers, the faithful ones who mature early, to the earth from heaven, from the air, to judge the people who are still living on the earth at that time, that is, the nations 25:31-32 .
[138]  As for those who have died in the past generations, the Lord will judge them at the great white throne after another thousand years at the end of the millennial kingdom Rev 20:11-15 .
[139]  His judging of the living is before the millennial kingdom, and His judging of the dead is after the millennial kingdom, both of which determine the matter of eternal perdition for man.
[140]  The result of this judgment is that those who receive the eternal gospel, fear God, and do not kill the saints but rather help them when they have the opportunity will be counted by the Lord as righteous.
