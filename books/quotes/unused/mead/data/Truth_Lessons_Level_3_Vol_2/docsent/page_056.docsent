   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ruth and Boaz are a complete prefigure of the Gentile sinners being brought with Israel, God s elect, into the divine inheritance through the redemption of Christ in their union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ruth was one of the Moabites, who were forbidden to enter the holy congregation of Jehovah, yet she became a part of Israel and partook of her husband s inheritance through marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She chose God and His kingdom and exercised her right to glean the harvest of God s elect and partake of the rich produce of the inheritance of God s elect.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, she gained a redeeming husband, and she conceived and brought forth a son to bring in the royal house of David.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, she became an important ancestor in the genealogy of Christ to continue the line of the God-created humanity for the incarnation of Christ to accomplish the eternal economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She typifies the Gentile church, before her salvation, as men in God s creation and sinners in man s fall, yet the church with her old man as her crucified husband was redeemed by Christ for the recovery of the lost right of her natural man in God s creation.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Gentile sinners were thus attached to Christ to partake of the inheritance of God s promise, producing a home for rest and bringing forth Christ and spreading Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Boaz was a man rich in wealth and generous in giving.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, he was a kinsman of Ruth s father-in-law, Elimelech, and he was qualified and willing to redeem the lost right of Ruth s deceased husband s inheritance and to take Ruth as his wife to bear a son for the establishing of her husband s name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In all these aspects Boaz typifies Christ, who is of the highest status, is rich in God s grace, has the unsearchable riches, and takes care of God s needy people by His bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ partook of blood and flesh to be like us and became the believers Kinsman.</S>
