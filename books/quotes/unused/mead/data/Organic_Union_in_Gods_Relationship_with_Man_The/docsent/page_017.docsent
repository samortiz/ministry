   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Dying an All-inclusive Death and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Entering into an All-producing Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a man He needed to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thirty years were assigned to Him for His growth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When He became thirty years of age, He came out to minister for God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, people, under the instigation of Satan, put Him on the cross and crucified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This fulfilled God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through His crucifixion on the cross, He died an all-inclusive death not a common death that is hated by man but an all-inclusive death that is loved by His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is a cross in the universe that has accomplished an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This death terminated Satan Heb 2:14 , the world John 12:31 , the old creation Col 1:15b , the fallen man Rom 6:6 , man's sinful constitution 8:3 , and everything negative in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This all-inclusive death was not only a terminating death but also a releasing death, for through it the divine life was released from the human shell of the man Jesus Christ John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After accomplishing such an all-inclusive death, Christ entered into rest and was buried.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then, after three days He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His death was all-inclusive terminating, redeeming, and releasing and His resurrection was all-producing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His resurrection a life-giving Spirit was produced 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before Christ's resurrection, there was not such a life-giving Spirit in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 7:39 says that "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified"; that is, Jesus had not yet entered into resurrection Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the day that He entered into resurrection, the life-giving Spirit was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His resurrection also produced Him as the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In eternity He was the only begotten Son of God John 1:18 , but in resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With Him, thousands of sons of God were born 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How producing the resurrection of Christ was!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today in the universe there are three particular categories of things: 1 the life-giving Spirit, 2 the firstborn Son of God, and 3 the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we are the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These many sons are the counterpart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the many sons of God, we are a part of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the Head and we are the Body Col 1:18a; Eph 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we are a part of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within us He is the life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ 2 Cor 3:17 , who is the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ascending to Be Made the Lord, the Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>the Leader, and the Savior</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After He died and resurrected, He ascended to the heavens to be officially appointed, established, and made the Lord of all, the Christ of God, the Leader of all the kings on this earth, and the Savior Acts 2:36; 5:31; Rev 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As such a One, He has the full right and the authority to manage the entire world so that He can save people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If He were not such a Leader, we would not have been and could not have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have been saved because He is not only the Savior but also the Ruler of the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although I was born in faraway China, the ascended Christ sent missionaries to China by means of imperialism.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even imperialism was used by Christ to save me and many others in China.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is Christ, and Christ now is the Lord of all, the Christ of God, the Leader of all the rulers on this earth, and the Savior.</S>
