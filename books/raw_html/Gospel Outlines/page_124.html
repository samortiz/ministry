<h1 class="title">REPENT AND BE CONVERTED</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 3:19, 26</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Men are in sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Describe men living in sins.</li>
	<li>Use examples to illustrate the picture of men living in sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Men have no rest
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Sins cause men to have problems with God. Men&rsquo;s consciences also condemn them constantly because of sin. They often encounter God&rsquo;s judgment. Therefore, they often lose their peace. There is no peace either in their conscience or in their environment.</li>
	<li>Sins also often cause men to have problems with one another. The discord between husband and wife, manager and clerk, classmates and colleagues are examples of men&rsquo;s problems with one another.</li>
	<li>Sins also cause men to have problems with themselves. Sinners destroy themselves. They live a contradictory life. Their mind urges them to do good, but the lust within them compels them to do the opposite. Their mind urges them to take care of their family, fame, position, and health; but sins cause them to destroy all of these. The agony within such men is beyond description.</li>
	<li>Since men have problems with God, with one another, and with themselves, they have no peace. Both in the outward environment and in the inward sensation in their conscience, they lose the normalcy, the peace; therefore, they have no rest. <em>When describing the absence of rest within men, elaborate on it thoroughly.</em></li>
