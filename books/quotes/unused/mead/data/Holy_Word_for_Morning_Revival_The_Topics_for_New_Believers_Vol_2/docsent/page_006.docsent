   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 8 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 John 5:12 He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1:5, 7 ...God is light....Walk in the light...</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s Attributes</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we speak of God s attributes, we refer to all that belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>31 God s attributes refer to His characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has many attributes, and God s inward being is the totality of His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>32 An attribute denotes the very element or essence of something that has not yet been expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When an attribute is expressed, it becomes a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Strictly speaking, as men, we do not have the attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The true attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness are of God and belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when God became a man to live on this earth, the attributes of God were expressed in human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The attributes are of divinity, but the expressed virtues are through humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the expressed attributes are virtues, and the hidden essence and element of the virtues are the attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>33</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The divine life may be considered as the first and the basic attribute of God....Actually in the whole universe only the life of God can be counted as life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First John 5:12...indicates that unless we have the life of God, we do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the sight of God only His life is life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The life of God is divine and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word divine means being of God, having the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word eternal means being uncreated, without beginning or ending, existing by itself, and ever, unchangeably existing....</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the life of God, being divine and eternal, is immortal and unchangeable; it remains the same and continues living even after passing through any kind of blow or destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>34</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Love</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The divine love...is the nature of God s essence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, it is an essential attribute of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 3:16 tells us that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, and 1 John 4:9 says, In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As in 1 Timothy 1:15, the world refers to fallen mankind, whom God so loved that, by making them alive through His Son with His own life, they might become His children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this the love of God has been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ephesians 2:4 says, God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The object of love should be in a lovable condition, but the object of mercy is always in a pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, God s mercy reaches further than His love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God loves us because we are the object of His selection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we became pitiful by our fall, even dead in our offenses and sins; therefore, we need God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because of His great love, God is rich in mercy to save us from our wretched position to a condition that is suitable for His love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The nobler love of God as His essential attribute needs His attribute of mercy to reach us in the deep pit of our fallen life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Light</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The divine light...is the nature of God s expression....</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to Revelation 22:5, being illumined by the Lord God will be one of the blessings to God s redeemed in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We shall have no need of a lamp, the light made by man, nor of the sun, the light created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God Himself will shine upon us, and we shall live under His illumination.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God Himself will be the light, and Christ will be the lamp, shining out God to enlighten the entire city 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today the divine light as God s expressive attribute is applied to us in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First John 1:5-7 tells us that God is light and that if we fellowship with Him we should walk in the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indicates that we can enjoy this expressive attribute of God even in this age before the New Jerusalem will come in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>35</S>
