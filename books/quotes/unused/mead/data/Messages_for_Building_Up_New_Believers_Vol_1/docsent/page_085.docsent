   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is genuine praise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows us the nature of praise in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The nature of praise is an offering, a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, praise comes from pain and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hebrews 13:15 says, Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When a person offers up his praise, he is losing something; he is offering a sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In other words, God inflicts wounds; He breaks and cuts a person deeply, yet at the same time, such a person turns to Him and praises Him.</S>

   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we have not learned to praise God every day, it is hard to have the kind of sacrifice of praise spoken of in Hebrews 13.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As you learn to praise, you will find that there are days in which you cannot gather yourself to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Perhaps you praised God seven times today, yesterday, and the day before.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Perhaps you praised Him a week or a month ago.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But one day you will find that you cannot utter a praise.</S>
