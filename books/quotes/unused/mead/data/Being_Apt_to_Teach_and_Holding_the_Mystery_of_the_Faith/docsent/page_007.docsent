   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"Therefore it is my opinion" Speaking according to One's Observation of God's Work in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 15 also shows us how we should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we see the patterns set up by three persons: Peter, Paul, and James.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should imitate these three persons in the way they spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They did not speak merely according to their own opinions but according to the observations that they had made and the sense that they had received in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter spoke according to what he had observed of God's work in the church, as did Paul and James.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that they did not have any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>James said, "Therefore it is my opinion" v. 19, Chinese Union Version . This shows that he had an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His opinion, however, was based on the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may speak differently from one another, but we should not speak according to our own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, we should not speak according to our preference, because that kind of speaking is mostly of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are concerned about the church, we must learn to speak according to what we have observed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, when we learn to speak in this way, the Chinese should not have Chinese views, and the foreigners should not have foreigners' views.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is not the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the church you must fear God, and I must also fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You should not take the customs of the foreigners, and I should not take the ways of the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have a part in the Lord's work, and I also have a part in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, you should speak out what you have observed concerning the Lord's work, and I also should speak out what I have observed regarding the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Peter was thoroughly a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, in Acts 15 when many people were discussing, Peter spoke not according to his own opinion but according to the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He rose up and said, "Men, brothers, you know that from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth " v. 7 . In today's environment hardly anyone speaks this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the surface we are all very humble.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the service meetings most people say, "I am not worthy to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am the least.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not have anything to say.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not have any opinion."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet when the meeting is over, they express their opinions endlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, Peter was not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not speak superficially polite words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Being polite often is worse than being fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, Peter was speaking the truth before God without being proud.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all have to be like Peter, being completely without pride but being able to rise up to say according to the fact, "Brothers, concerning the matter of serving the Lord, I perceive that God wants us to serve in this manner."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This opinion is spiritual, not subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is experiential, based on the work of God, and is not fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"The Holy Spirit and us" God and Man Mingled Together Making a Decision</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Peter had finished speaking, Paul rose up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, how was the matter decided?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Was it according to the democratic way of the minority submitting to the majority?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Acts we see that after Peter had spoken, there was no solution, and after Paul had finished speaking, there was still no solution.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One said that God gave grace to the Gentiles through him, and the other also said that God gave grace to the Gentiles through him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All those who were present in that gathering spoke thoroughly concerning what they saw related to God's work in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, in Acts 15 first we see that everyone participated in the discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second, we see that in the discussion they did not speak according to their own feelings but according to the result of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They were delivered from their own opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Third, we see that the leading one among the children of God made a decision based upon the opinions expressed by everyone and also according to the principle in the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a decision by the church and the Holy Spirit was spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was a decision not of man neither of an individual nor of the majority but of "the Holy Spirit and us" v. 28 . How wonderful! It was a decision made by God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we do not make the decision by ourselves, but the Holy Spirit and we make the decision together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to make this kind of decision, we need to learn to fear the Lord and live before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to learn to reject the flesh and the natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We also need to learn to be conscious of the church and of the work, just as Peter was conscious of the church and Paul was conscious of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Scriptures the most spiritual matter is God being mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although man is speaking, it seems that it is God who is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is the speaking of God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not merely God speaking, nor is it merely man speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, it is God speaking with man by being mingled with man, and it is man speaking under the Holy Spirit, that is, under the control and restriction of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In addition, the elders should not decide any matter by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, they should observe the situation of the saints and also allow the saints to fully express in fellowship their feelings before God concerning the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then the elders should make a decision not merely according to their own feelings but according to the feelings of all the children of God and according to the principles in the holy Scriptures as well.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the church, decisions should not be made based merely on whatever the elders say.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Neither should the elders make decisions by getting the consent of the majority of the saints when they are unsure of what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Any decision concerning church affairs must be the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Such a decision is neither of one individual nor of the majority but of "the Holy Spirit and us."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is spiritual, and this is the principle for the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The administration of the church does not depend upon the opinion of one individual or upon the opinion of the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Please keep in mind that all our own opinions are from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, in the church service we should put all our opinions aside.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not to say that we should not have any observations or feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, the Holy Spirit should be moving within us, and as the saints and we are gathered together, we should all lay out our feelings before the Lord and fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then before the Lord and according to these feelings we should make a decision under the principles shown in the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order to have a proper administration of the church we need to put aside our flesh, opinions, narrowness, negligence, and carelessness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some are too careless, and others are too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Neither is acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some are too negligent, and others are too natural.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Both of these will not do.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must let the Holy Spirit make manifest the feelings of all the saints and then make a decision based upon these feelings along with the principles revealed in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I am not saying that if we make decisions this way, we will never make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But I dare say that even if we make a little mistake, we will still be right according to the spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We would rather make a mistake while doing things the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the basic principle.</S>
