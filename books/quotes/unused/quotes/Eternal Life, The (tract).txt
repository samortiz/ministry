Regardless of how many commodities we possess, how much wealth we amass, ultimately our lives fail and we pass away
Life is what is most in demand on this earth, but there is no market for it and no amount of wealth can acquire and keep it
The Bible reveals that the true God is triune; that is, He is one God , yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
These are the believers of Christ, and through regeneration God becomes their genuine Father, and they become His genuine sons
Through their receiving of the eternal life of God, God becomes their Father in the most intimate and truest sense
The word son expresses a life relationship with a father, and Christ, as the Son of God, fully embodies the life of God the Father
For this reason, after He died for our sins on the cross, He rose from the dead, since it was not possible for Him to be held by death
As God, He brought the eternal life to man; and as a man, He was the first to overcome death and enjoy the life of God in resurrection
It is wonderful that the life of God is embodied in Christ the Son and that He desires that men would have this eternal life
Christ has risen from the dead, but how can we, who still suffer the woes of fallen mankind, enjoy God's resurrection life?
The life of this lifegiving Spirit is Christ as life the eternal life of God and when this life is given to man it is given as the Spirit
The Lord Jesus told His disciples that the Spirit of reality testifies concerning Him and guides the believers into all the reality of Him
Particularly, the Spirit is life because He is the reality of Christ as the embodiment of the life of God the Father
