<h2 class=head2>Old Testament Prophecies concerning Christ</h2><h2 class=head3>The Seed of Woman</h2><p>The first prophecy concerning Christ in the Old Testament is the seed of the woman, which is found in Genesis 3:15. Neither Adam nor any of his direct descendants were this seed of woman. Christ is the unique seed of the woman. He is the only one among the entire human race that was born only of a woman. Apparently, we are all born of our mother, but in actuality we are born of our father. Someone may say that Cain, for example, was the son of Adam and of Eve, but the Scriptures do not say this. Rather, Cain and Abel were both the sons of Adam. All human beings are the sons of Adam, the descendants of a man. Among the entire human race, there is only one person of human blood and flesh whose birth had nothing to do with a man.<p>The fulfillment of this prophecy in the New Testament is found in Galatians 4:4 which says, “When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under law.” Similarly, Matthew 1:23 says, “Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son.”<h2 class=head3>The Seed of Abraham</h2><p>Genesis 22:18 records the second main prophecy concerning Christ. In this verse Christ is prophesied as the seed of Abraham. This prophecy was repeated to Isaac in Genesis 26:4 and again to Jacob in Genesis 28:14. These three verses are not three prophecies but one prophecy of Christ as the seed of Abraham. The fulfillment of this prophetic word is in Galatians 3:16; it is also in Matthew 1:1, which says that Christ is the Son of Abraham.<h2 class=head3>The Seed of David</h2><p>The third prophecy concerns Christ as the seed of David. Christ as the seed of David is predicted in 2 Samuel 7:12-14 and Isaiah 11:1-5 and 10. Isaiah 11:1 says, “Then a sprout will come forth from the stump of Jesse,/And a branch from his roots will bear fruit.” By reading verses 1 through 5, we can realize that this branch is Christ, who comes out of Jesse as the root.<p>The first verse in the New Testament, Matthew 1:1, is very meaningful, telling us that Christ is the son not only of Abraham but also of David. Jesse was the father of David, and David was the forefather of Christ. Therefore, Jesse also is the forefather of Christ. From this point of view, Christ is the branch coming out of the root, the descendant coming out of the forefather. Isaiah 11:10, however, speaks of Christ as the root of Jesse. In this verse, Christ is no longer the descendant of Jesse but his root. Revelation 5:5 refers to Christ as “the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David.” As the Root of David, Christ is David’s forefather, but as the branch, Christ is David’s descendant.<p>In Matthew 22:41-46 Christ questioned the Pharisees in His wisdom. These verses say, “Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them, saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David’s. He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet’? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son? And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore.” On the one hand, Christ is the Son of David who came out of David, while on the other hand, He is the Lord of David, the Root of David out of whom David came. Christ is the wonderful One who is everything: He is the root, the branch, and the sprout. He is the Son, yet He is the source.<p>The central thought of all of these prophecies is that God wants to mingle Himself with man. Therefore, on the one hand, Christ is man, but on the other hand, He is God. As a man He is the sprout, the branch, while as God He is the root, the source. The central message of the prophecies of the Old Testament is that God Himself mingles with man to be a man. Because Christ is both God and man, He is both the branch and the root. As man He is the expression; as God He is the source. Such a Christ is the wonderful One. If we do not know this One, our mouth will be shut like the mouths of the Pharisees (v. 46), and we will not be able to understand the Scriptures.
