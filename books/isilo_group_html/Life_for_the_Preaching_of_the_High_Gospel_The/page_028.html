This point is: "Go therefore and disciple all the nations" (Matt. 28:19a). The Greek word for nations may also be rendered as Gentiles. As we are getting ourselves prepared to go and disciple the nations, we need certain qualifications. We need to be qualified in certain aspects.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOING TO THE LAND OF THE GENTILES</H2><P>The Lord did not charge His disciples to go and disciple the nations in the temple. He appointed them to go to Galilee. In Matthew 4 we are told that Galilee was the land of the Gentiles; it was called "Galilee of the Gentiles" (v. 15). The Lord told the disciples to get out of the so-called holy land and go to the land of the Gentiles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO BE TRANSCENDENT</H2><P>Moreover, the Lord's charge to His disciples took place on a mountain (Matt. 28:16). This is quite meaningful. To be outside of the temple, outside of the synagogues, outside of the religious centers, and to be on the mountaintop simply means that you have to be on high ground. You have to be transcendent. You have to be on the top of the high mountain to see the nations.</P><P>Young brothers and sisters, if you have the intention to go and disciple the unbelievers, you have to be on high. You have to be on the top of the high mountain to look down at the pitiful, miserable situation. When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, no doubt, many times He was on the seashore, on the beach. But when He gave the commandment to the disciples to go and disciple others, He did not do it on the beach. He did it on the top of a high mountain. If we are going to disciple others, first, we have to be on high. If we are on the same level as the Americans, we are finished. We have to be on high to disciple others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD HAVING ALL AUTHORITY<br>IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH</H2><P>Next, in Matthew 28:18 the Lord Jesus said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth." Some versions use the word power instead of authority, but the Greek word here means authority. Authority is higher than power. Let me illustrate in this way. On the street, there are policemen and there are cars. A big car driving on the road has the power, whereas a little policeman has the authority. No matter how powerful your car is, you have to come under the authority of the policeman. Thus, authority is above power. Jesus has not only power but also authority. Both in heaven and on earth the authority belongs to Jesus.</P><P>Jesus has the authority over the United States, over the Middle East, and over the whole earth. Jesus has the authority, not the government of the United States, nor the government of Russia, nor the government of China. Jesus is above every nation (Rev. 1:5). We have to see that Jesus has been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Then when we go, we go with the authority of the ascended, enthroned, and glorified Jesus.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Life for the Preaching of the High Gospel &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
