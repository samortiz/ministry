   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; John 20:22; 3:5-6, 15, 36a; Rom 6:3, 5; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:9-11; 2 Tim 4:22; Eph 3:16-17; Col 1:18a; Eph 5:30; 2:15; Col 3:10-11 RECEIVING THE REVELATION CONCERNING THE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BELIEVERS' ORGANIC UNION WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The secret of experiencing Christ is first to receive three revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first is the revelation of Christ's Person, and the second is the revelation of Christ's work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two revelations have been adequately covered in the previous chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this chapter we come to the third revelation, the revelation concerning the believers' organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This organic union is the most crucial aspect of the secret of experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For us to experience Christ and enjoy Him, we must see a clear vision concerning our organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible first reveals to us the Person of Christ, and then it reveals to us the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After these two basic revelations, the Bible reveals to us the organic union which we have with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In one of the first four books of the New Testament, the Gospel of John, we see an illustration of the vine with all the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then in the following twenty-three books, from Acts through Revelation, what is revealed is mainly this organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul's fourteen Epistles especially focus on this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we read Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, the more we can realize that Paul had seen a full revelation, and that he had a full knowledge concerning this revelation which unveils to us our organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A UNION OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The most wonderful reality in the Christian experience is that all the believers in Christ are united with Him in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The union of the believers with Christ is not by organization, but by life; hence, this union is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word organic denotes that this union is absolutely a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A good illustration of this organic union is our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our body has many members, but all the members are organically united into one body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The uniting factor is life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the body dies, after a certain number of days all the members will be separated and scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When life is in the body, all the members are organically united together, but when life is gone, all the members eventually become disunited, detached.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The members of the body are united together not by organization, but by a living, crucial, and vital factor life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We the believers in Christ are one with Him because of such a living, uniting factor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason we refer to our union with Christ as an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this message I would like to impress you with the fact that we have such an organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is wonderful in His Person, and He is excellent in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His Person, He is both the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His work, He did everything that is needed for the fulfilling of God's purpose, and He did everything that is needed for our benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever He is and whatever He has done is altogether for one thing: that He could be united to us organically.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This wonderful organic union is very much neglected by most Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today's Christianity has become a religion, a religious organization, full of teachings, doctrines, ordinances, and practices, a religion which neglects the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many Christians preach Christ and teach Christ in an objective way, making Him an objective Redeemer and an objective Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In their concept and realization Christ is in the third heavens, not within them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They may be right to a certain extent in an objective way, but surely they are wrong in relation to the subjective reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today in the Lord's recovery, the Lord is recovering this neglected matter of the believers' organic union with Christ.</S>
