   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRANSFORMATION BY THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The section above covers the negative aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us consider our positive union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 2 the word "mind" in Greek is nous.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word "bodies" in verse 1 is soma in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the outward body is presented as a sacrifice, there is one positive result: the renewing and transformation of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 2 points out a matter on the negative side: "Do not be fashioned according to this age."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible the world refers to the world organization and the world spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It does not necessarily refer to the outward things of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A Christian can shun all the things in the world, but the spirit of the world can still be in him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Israelites left Egypt in their bodies, but their minds were still craving Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who can give up the love of the world?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only those who are consecrated and whose minds have been renewed and transformed can give up the love of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians act and live the same way as the people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their minds and thoughts are the same as the people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We often say that a person is very political or that he is very smart or business-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God delivers us, He delivers us out of all kinds of worldly minds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A perplexing thing among God's children is that their guidance concerning God's will is often based on their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They discern God's will according to their political and business-like mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when the cross touches our whole being, it touches our mind as well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only those whose minds are renewed can have a transformed mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Romans 12:1-2 there are things that we should do and things that we should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not be fashioned according to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that we should not walk according to the manner of this world; instead, we should be renewed and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Renewal is on our side, and transformation is on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means being changed from the world image and our self image to the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only does our mind have to be renewed in regard to sinful things, but in regard to our total walk and spiritual life as well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this renewal we experience resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Originally, the sacrifices are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But when Christ lives in us, we have the mind, the thoughts, and the understanding of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>KNOWING GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not everyone can know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only those whose bodies are presented as living sacrifices and whose minds are renewed and transformed can know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the knowledge of His will comes effortlessly and spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's will is the manifestation of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His life is clean and pure; it enables men to discern the flesh and the natural man and delivering men from carnality and worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only those who are delivered from these things can know God's will and prove what the will of the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we present our bodies and are renewed and transformed in our mind, we can know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no easier or lighter way than the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The easiest and quickest way to know God's will is through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only the stripping and smiting of the cross will expose the natural life, the flesh, the lusts, the world, and the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only through the stripping will we know the power of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is useless to lecture, teach, or exhort others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They may be very eager to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if they have not consecrated themselves, they will not receive any help at all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, when the cross operates in them, their mind will be renewed and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The natural life must be dealt with before one can see any result in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is easy to criticize, but it is hard to have a vision of the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is easy to slander, but it is hard to discern and to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is a difference between proper discernment and criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who are in the light will discern without criticism or slander.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What do we know about God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Romans 12:2 says that God's will is good.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because something is good does not necessarily make it God's will, but all that is of God's will is good.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a believer's mind is renewed before God, this mind surely will be good.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many people can talk about God's will with their mouth, but only those who know the cross can say that God's will is good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's will is also perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that it is flawless and irreproachable.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's will is also well pleasing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we present our bodies as a living sacrifice, we are doing something well pleasing to God, and God's will also becomes well pleasing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At this point all murmurings cease, and there are no complaints against heaven or against man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God's will is not in man's mind, wavering and fluctuating like the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is something that is manifested before men.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only those who rest in the Lord can know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a man is in a state of turmoil, confusion, grievance, and unrest, it means that he does not have the mark of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Such a one cannot know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we criticize, complain, or are dissatisfied with God's will, it means that we have never consecrated ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a man thinks that his means are better and his ways are higher, it shows that he is void of light and has not seen the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In order to know God's will, we have to present our bodies as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not be fashioned according to this age, and our minds must be renewed and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These three things are the conditions for knowing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God's will is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we have these three facts with us, we will have no problem in knowing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Otherwise, we will never know it in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Prayer: Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May these words not be words that just come out of our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May they be the cries from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not want to be dealt with in a fragmentary way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Deal with us once and for all in a fundamental way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>May we not murmur, and may our only fear be of not knowing Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We look to You for Your mercy and shining so that we can know God's will thoroughly and clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In Your name we pray, amen.</S>
