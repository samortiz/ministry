   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 2 Samuel 7:12 God was actually telling David that instead of building something for God, he needed God to build His Son into him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a marvelous fact that eventually David's seed would be called the Son of God Rom 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As God, He is the Son of God; as man, He is our seed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the Son of God is not constituted into us, we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Son of God must become our seed, yet He remains the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we were saved, many of us believed the gospel in a shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more I study the Bible, the more I realize that the gospel is not shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The genuine and intrinsic gospel is that God intends to work Himself in Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2 Samuel 7:12 we have the genuine preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we preach this intrinsic gospel, we will tell others that they should not think that they can do something for God, for their human life is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will tell them that they are short of something and that what they need is Christ, the very God Himself, to be wrought into their being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to work Himself into us, God first became a man through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a man He died for us, and then rose up from among the dead and became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This life-giving Spirit is our Savior, who redeemed us on the cross and who is now saving us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is our Redeemer, Savior, life, and seed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As such a One, He is now being built, constituted, into us, making us a part of Him, even as He has made Himself a part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we read 2 Samuel 7 under God's enlightening, we will see that the seed of David is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to verse 7 God will establish David's kingdom, which refers to Christ's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that the kingdom of David is Christ's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The prophets spoke of David and Christ as one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Hosea 3:5 and Amos 9:11 the coming of King David refers to Christ's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ Building a House for God's Name,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>and God Establishing</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>the Throne of Christ's Kingdom Forever</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second Samuel 7:13 reveals that it is Christ who will build a house for God's name, and God will establish the throne of Christ's kingdom forever.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God Being Christ's Father,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>and Christ Being God's Son</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 14a says, "I will be his Father, and he will be My son."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This actually reveals that God will be Christ's Father and that Christ will be God's Son Heb 1:5b .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's salvation is just to make Christ, His embodiment, ours.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Son of God, who is the embodiment of God, God Himself, is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we can declare that Christ, the Son of God, has been built into us.</S>
