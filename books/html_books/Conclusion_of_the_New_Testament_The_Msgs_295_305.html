OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED NINETY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the Epistles. We begin with the experience and enjoyment of Christ in Romans. Often considered the fifth gospel, Romans is a rich, deep, thoughtful, and logical book. It is rich in the enjoyment of Christ as indicated by a particular expression in 10:12: &ldquo;The same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Experiencing and Enjoying Him as:</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Seed of David and the Son of God</h2>
<p>Romans first shows us that for our experience and enjoyment the Lord&rsquo;s status is of two natures, human and divine. These two natures of Christ&rsquo;s person are indicated by the two titles of Christ in Romans 1:1-4&mdash;<em>seed of David</em> and <em>Son of God.</em> These verses say, &ldquo;Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to His human nature, Christ is the seed of David, a descendant of a person in history (Matt. 1:1; 22:42). According to His divine nature, He is the Son of God, the expression of God. In the New Testament the title <em>Son of God</em> means the expression of God (John 5:19; 14:7-9; Heb. 1:3). As the Son of God, Christ expresses God the Father: &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (John 1:18). No man has ever seen God, yet the Son as the Word of God and the speaking of God has declared Him (v. 1; Rev. 19:13; Heb. 1:2). The Father is the invisible God, the hidden God; the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, is the manifest God. As the seed of David and the Son of God, Christ is the complete God and the perfect man, the God-man.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Contents of the Gospel</h2>
<p>This mysterious person with a wonderful status of two natures&mdash;the Lord Jesus Christ as the seed of David and the Son of God&mdash;is the contents of the gospel of God which is revealed in the entire book of Romans. The book of Romans is a book on the gospel of God. The entire book&mdash;from chapter 1, which concerns the person of Jesus Christ the God-man and the righteousness of God, to chapter 16, which concerns the local churches as the expression of the Body of Christ&mdash;is the gospel, the good news and glad tidings (10:15), of God to men in its completeness. No other book presents to us the gospel of God in such a complete way as Romans does. In chapter 1 of Romans, we see Christ as a wonderful person with two natures&mdash;divine and human&mdash;and in the last chapter we see the local churches. This indicates that the beginning of the gospel is Christ and the consummation of the gospel is the local churches. These local churches are the issue of the dispensing of Christ&rsquo;s person with His divine and human nature. This One is dispensed into God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people to make them members of the Body of Christ as the church of God, which is expressed around the globe as the local churches. The gospel of God is thus God&rsquo;s entire New Testament economy, and the center of this gospel of God is Jesus Christ the God-man.</p>
<p>The gospel of God as revealed in Romans is not concerned with religion, doctrine, or forms, nor is it merely concerned with redemption, forgiveness, or justification. As Romans 1:3-4 makes clear, the gospel of God is concerned with God&rsquo;s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. This indicates that the gospel is concerned with sonship. God&rsquo;s delight, desire, and pleasure are all related to His Son (Matt. 3:17; 17:5; Gal. 1:15-16). Romans 8:28-29 then reveals that it is God&rsquo;s intention to produce many sons conformed to the pattern, the model, of Christ as the firstborn Son of God. Through Christ, in Christ, and with Christ, many sons are being produced. Romans 1:3-4 gives us Christ, God&rsquo;s Son, as the prototype, and 8:29-30 unveils the many sons as the mass production. Thus, the gospel of God is concerned with producing many sons conformed to the image of Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Jesus Christ Our Lord</h2>
<p>According to 1:3-4, the One who is the seed of David and the Son of God is &ldquo;Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; His name is Jesus, His title is Christ, and He is our Lord. <em>Jesus,</em> a name given by God, is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name <em>Joshua</em> (Num. 13:16), which means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the salvation of Jehovah.&rdquo; Hence, Jesus is not only a man but Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation. Thus, He is our Savior. He is also our Joshua, the One who brings us into rest (Heb. 4:8; Matt. 11:28-29), which is Himself as the good land to us (Col. 1:12).</p>
<p><em>Christ</em> is the title of the Lord according to His office, His mission. <em>Christ</em> is the anglicized form of the Greek word <em>Christos</em> , which is equivalent to the Hebrew <em>Messiah.</em> Both <em>Messiah</em> in Hebrew and <em>Christos</em> in Greek mean &ldquo;the anointed One.&rdquo; Christ is God&rsquo;s Anointed, the One appointed by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, His eternal plan. His appointment is related to the Lord&rsquo;s commission. His commission is to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent. When this anointed One was crucified, He was carrying out His function as the Christ. Not only His death but also His resurrection and ascension were part of His function. Therefore, Christ, the anointed One, carried out His function through crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension so that God may dispense Himself into us for the producing of the church.</p>
<p><em>Our Lord</em> refers to His lordship. Jesus became the Lord after His ascension to the heavens (Acts 2:36). This means that a man from Nazareth named Jesus has been made the Lord of all (10:36). Thus, the man Jesus Christ is our Lord. This lordship is now in the Spirit. In the Lord Spirit we have the elements of ascension and lordship (2 Cor. 3:18). Whenever we turn to our spirit and call upon the name of the Lord, we should enthrone the Lord, giving Him the lordship in us. We must repent to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I am not under Your lordship, Your authority. Lord, I confess that I have been ruled only by myself.&rdquo; We need to allow the Lord to be on the throne within us, honoring Him as our Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Seed of David according to the Flesh<br />
in His Humanity</h2>
<p>Regarding the status of Christ, we should note that the phrase <em>according to</em> is used twice in Romans 1:3-4: He was the seed of David according to the flesh, and He was the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness. The two occurrences of <em>according to</em> in 1:3-4 show that the Lord has two essences&mdash;the human essence and the divine essence. For this reason, Christ could be of two natures; He could be at the same time divine and human as well as human and divine. Hence, He is a wonderful person. He is not only God but also man; He is not only man but also God. He is the complete God plus the perfect man. Therefore, many great Bible teachers through the centuries have considered Christ to be the God-man.</p>
<p>Christ is the seed of David according to the flesh and in His humanity (v. 3). Here <em>flesh</em> refers not to created man&mdash;man as originally created by God&mdash;but to fallen man&mdash;man who became flesh through the fall. When God first created man, man was not flesh. However, man&rsquo;s fall brought sin into man&rsquo;s nature, changing created man into fallen man. Genesis 6:3 indicates that by the time of the flood, the entire human race had become flesh. When Christ became flesh as the seed of David, He became a man in the likeness, the form, of fallen man but without the sinful nature. Romans 8:3 says that God sent &ldquo;His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.&rdquo; Christ does not possess any sin; He has nothing to do with sin (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15; 1 John 3:5). Hence, when Christ became flesh, He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin and did not have the sin of the flesh. This is typified by the bronze serpent lifted up by Moses for the sinful Israelites (Num. 21:9; John 3:14). The bronze serpent was in the form, the likeness, of the actual serpent but did not have its poison. Christ was made in &ldquo;the likeness of the flesh of sin,&rdquo; but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh.</p><h2 class="head4">d. The Son of God Designated in Power<br />
according to the Spirit of Holiness<br />
out of the Resurrection of the Dead in His Divinity</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Designated the Son of God</h2>
<p>The Jews recognized the Lord&rsquo;s status as the seed of David according to the flesh. Many of them admitted that Jesus was a royal descendant of David (Matt. 1:1; 9:27; 12:23; 21:9, 15). However, regarding the Lord&rsquo;s status as the Son of God, there was a great controversy among the Jews when He was on the earth (Mark 2:5-7; John 6:41-42). One day the Lord Jesus asked His disciples a question, &ldquo;Who do men say that the Son of Man is?&rdquo; (Matt. 16:13). They said, &ldquo;Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets&rdquo; (v. 14). This indicates that the Jews debated among themselves concerning His person. Without heavenly revelation they could realize, at most, only that He was the greatest among the prophets; none of them could know that He is the Son of the living God (v. 16). Eventually, the Jews condemned Him to death because He claimed that He was the Son of God (26:63-66; 27:43; Mark 14:61-64; Luke 22:70; John 5:18; 9:35-37). For the Jewish leaders, to declare oneself as the Son of God was blasphemy (10:30-33, 36). They thought that Christ was blaspheming God because they believed that He was not the Son of God but merely a man in the flesh.</p>
<p>Before His incarnation and resurrection, Christ was already the Son of God. After He became incarnate, however, His divine nature was concealed by the flesh. However, according to Romans 1:4, when He entered into resurrection, He was designated in power as the Son of God in His humanity. Unlike the resurrection of Lazarus (John 11:41-44) and of others (Luke 7:11-17; 8:49-54), the resurrection of Christ was not common but very particular. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is different because His resurrection was His designation as the Son of God.</p>
<p> There was no need for Christ to be designated as the Son of Man, because when people saw Him, they immediately recognized that He was a man. However, there was a need for Him to be designated the Son of God because the Son of God was concealed in Him as the Son of Man. His divinity was concealed in His humanity. People could easily recognize His humanity, but not His divinity. This concealed divinity needed to be designated, made manifest, by the resurrection. When He was resurrected, He was designated, or manifested, the Son of God with His humanity.</p>
<p>Before His incarnation, Christ, the divine One, already was the Son of God (John 1:18; Rom. 8:3). By incarnation He put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity; that part of Him needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection. By resurrection His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed. Hence, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God with His humanity (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5). His resurrection was His designation. Now, as the Son of God, He possesses humanity as well as divinity. By incarnation He brought God into man; by resurrection He brought man into God, that is, He brought His humanity into the divine sonship. In this way the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity. God is using such a Christ, the firstborn Son, who possesses both divinity and humanity, as the producer and as the prototype, the model, to produce His many sons (Rom. 8:29-30)&mdash;we who have believed in and received His Son. We too will be designated and revealed as the sons of God, as He was in the glory of His resurrection (vv. 19, 21), and with Him we will express God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) According to the Spirit of Holiness</h2>
<p>Christ as the seed of David according to the flesh was designated the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead. The Spirit of holiness in 1:4 is in contrast with the flesh in verse 3. Just as the flesh in verse 3 refers to the human essence of Christ, so the Spirit in verse 4 does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit but to the spiritual essence of Christ&rsquo;s divinity, that is, the divine essence of Christ. When Christ became a man and thereby put on humanity, He did not give up His divinity. He came to be a man in His divinity, and that divinity is the Spirit (John 4:24). While Christ was on the earth, He was both God and man. According to His humanity, He was the flesh. According to His divinity, He was the Spirit. Christ is therefore one person of two natures, the divine nature and the human nature; the human nature is the flesh, and the divine nature is the Spirit. Jesus&rsquo; divinity is the Spirit of holiness. This divinity, being the Spirit of holiness Himself, has the divine power and the divine element to transform Christ&rsquo;s humanity, thereby making it divine.</p><h2 class="head5">(3) In Power</h2>
<p>In His resurrection Christ in His humanity was designated the Son of God, not in mere word but in power according to the Spirit of holiness. No doubt the divine power was very much exercised in His resurrection, yet we need to see that the divine power in which Christ&rsquo;s humanity was designated the Son of God is the power of life. The phrase <em>in power</em> in Romans 1:4 corresponds with 1 Peter 3:18, which says that Christ&rsquo;s flesh was put to death, but His Spirit was made alive. Here, to be made alive means to be empowered. In Christ&rsquo;s death His humanity, His flesh, was crucified. Then in His resurrection God the Spirit as Christ&rsquo;s divinity was enlivened with the new power of life to put divinity into the humanity of Christ to make it divine. In other words, before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, Christ&rsquo;s humanity was merely human, but in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the Spirit was made strong to impart divinity into His humanity to make it divine. Thus, in His resurrection Christ&rsquo;s humanity was designated the Son of God in the divine power, and the reality of the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) Out of the Resurrection of the Dead</h2>
<p>An especially marvelous word in Romans 1:4 is <em>resurrection.</em> Christ&rsquo;s humanity was designated the Son of God &ldquo;out of the resurrection of the dead.&rdquo; In 6:5 Paul says that &ldquo;we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.&rdquo; Christ was designated by resurrection, and we shall be in the likeness of this resurrection. As we share Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, we undergo the process of being designated the sons of God. It is by resurrection, in fact, that we are designated. It was in resurrection that Christ in His humanity was designated the Son of God. By means of such a resurrection we also are in the process of being designated the sons of God.</p>
<p>Romans 8:11 says, &ldquo;If the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; In this verse resurrection is linked to the Spirit. The Spirit is the reality of resurrection. The Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from among the dead dwells in us as the reality of resurrection. The resurrection we experience is actually the Holy Spirit Himself. The Spirit who dwells in us is the rising-up Spirit and the designating Spirit. Day by day, this Spirit is designating us to be the sons of God.</p>
<p>We should praise the Lord that we have the designating Spirit within us. We have the designating Christ as resurrection within. Do not try to improve yourself or to make yourself sinlessly perfect. Rather, enjoy and experience the designating Spirit. If by the Spirit we put to death the practices of the body, we will live (v. 13). We need to walk according to the Spirit, set our mind on the Spirit, and by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body. If we walk daily according to the Spirit, we will be fully in the process of designation by resurrection. By the power of resurrection, we will be transformed, conformed, and eventually glorified.</p>
<p>Designation is by resurrection, which includes sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. All these wonderful things are in the Spirit. By touching the Spirit, we enjoy resurrection and everything included in it. Resurrection is not a matter of doctrine; it is a matter of touching the Spirit. The simplest way to contact the Spirit is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. The more we touch the Spirit, the more we enjoy resurrection and the more we are sanctified, transformed, and glorified. In this way we experience being designated the sons of God by the Spirit.</p>
<p>The more we contact the Lord by calling upon His name, the more we sense His presence and the more we are conscious of His anointing within. By calling on the name of the Lord, we are watered, refreshed, sanctified, satisfied, and strengthened. The kind of teachings we need today are those regarding how we are designated by enjoying and experiencing Christ as the life-power. If we have this kind of teaching, we will realize that in ourselves we are hopeless and helpless, and we will no longer try to improve ourselves. Rather, we will exercise our spirit to contact the Lord so that we may enjoy His anointing and participate in the process of designation by resurrection.</p>
<p>The goal of the gospel as revealed in Romans is that God is transforming sinners in the flesh into the designated sons of God in the spirit for the building up of the Body of Christ. We have pointed out that even the Lord Jesus as a man according to the flesh had to be designated the Son of God. Before His designation, according to the flesh He was only the seed of David; in that part of His being He was not yet the Son of God. However, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness. In the same principle, according to the flesh we are sinners, but now that we have been regenerated, we can have our being according to the spirit. The more we walk according to the mingled spirit, the more we undergo the process of designation (v. 4). Day by day, we are resurrected, sanctified, transformed, and glorified. The way to be designated sons of God is not to acquire more teachings; it is to have our being according to the mingled spirit.</p>
<p>The center of the book of Romans, which is on the gospel of God, is an unlimited, all-inclusive, and all-extensive person, the most wonderful person in the whole universe&mdash;Jesus Christ the God-man, the seed of David and the Son of God. We should praise the Lord that He has both humanity and divinity, both the flesh and the Spirit of holiness, both the human essence and the divine essence. With Him as the prototype, there is the Spirit of holiness, the flesh, and the designation as the Son of God; we as His mass production also have the Spirit of holiness within and the human flesh without, and will be designated in full as sons of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Source of Grace and Peace</h2>
<p>According to Romans 1:7b, Christ is revealed as the source of grace and peace: &ldquo;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Grace is God in Christ as everything to us for our enjoyment (John 1:14, 16-17); it is the source. Peace is the result of our enjoyment of God in Christ (16:33); it is the issue. This peace is the inward rest, comfort, and satisfaction, not something outward. Furthermore, Christ with God our Father is the source of this grace and peace; both Christ and the Father are the source of grace and peace. That the Lord Jesus Christ is ranked with God the Father as the source of grace and peace indicates the divinity of Christ, that is, the Godhead, the deity, of Christ (Rom. 9:5; Col. 2:9). This is our wonderful Savior Jesus Christ, in whom we believe and whom we follow and worship.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Redeemer and the Propitiation Place</h2>
<p>In Romans 3:22-26 Christ is presented as the Redeemer and the propitiation place.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Believers Being Justified by God and Receiving<br />
the Righteousness of God through His Redemption</h2>
<p>Romans 3:22-24 reveals that we may enjoy and experience Christ as the Redeemer: &ldquo;Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; These verses show that the believers are justified by God and receive the righteousness of God through the redemption of Christ.</p>
<p>For us to be justified by God means that we are approved by God according to His standard of righteousness. No matter how righteous we may be in ourselves, we cannot be approved by God according to our righteousness. Our righteousness will never justify us before God. We may justify ourselves according to our standard of righteousness, but that does not enable us to be justified by God according to His standard. However, when God justifies us, we are approved by God according to the standard of His righteousness.</p>
<p>The believers are justified by God on the basis of the redemption of Christ. Romans 3:24 speaks of &ldquo;being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; To redeem is to purchase back at a cost. We originally belonged to God but became lost through sin. The requirements of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and glory were so great upon us that it was impossible for us to fulfill them. However, God paid the price for us through Christ, repossessing us at a tremendous cost. Christ died on the cross to redeem us (Gal. 3:13; Titus 2:14; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18); His blood obtained eternal redemption for us (1:18-19). Since Christ has paid the price for our sins and in His redemption has fulfilled all of God&rsquo;s requirements on us, God, because He is just, must justify us freely.</p>
<p>God can justify us because the work of justification is based upon the redemption of Christ. Because God is righteous, He must have a proper ground on which to justify us. Apart from Christ&rsquo;s redemption, God would not have the ground on which to justify us. For this reason, Christ&rsquo;s redemption is needed. When the redemption of Christ is applied to us, we are justified. If there were no such redemption, it would be impossible for us to be justified by God. Christ&rsquo;s redemption is the basis of God&rsquo;s justification. The redemption of Christ enables us to be justified by God. God is bound by His righteousness to justify us because of the redemption of Christ, which meets all His requirements.</p>
<p>Through the redemption of Christ not only are the believers justified by God, but they also receive Christ as the righteousness of God. Romans 3:22 speaks of &ldquo;the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe.&rdquo; Many Christians say incorrectly that they have the righteousness of Christ. Our righteousness is not the righteousness of Christ; it is Christ Himself. Christ Himself as a person, not His attribute of righteousness, has been made the righteousness of God to us (1 Cor. 1:30). Hence, we should declare, &ldquo;Christ is my righteousness. My righteousness before God is the living person of Christ, not an attribute. The righteous Christ is mine.&rdquo; God has made Christ, who is the embodiment of God Himself, our righteousness.</p>
<p>The righteousness of God is not only God Himself in His justice and rightness, and it is not only the living person of Christ; it is also we who have been made one with Christ. Second Corinthians 5:21 says that the believers are made the righteousness of God in Christ. This verse does not say that the believers are made righteous; rather, it says that they are made righteousness, the righteousness of God in Christ. We can become the righteousness of God by having Christ wrought into us. Christ is the embodiment of God, and God, as a living person, is righteousness. Therefore, righteousness, God, and Christ are one. The righteousness of God is God Himself. Since this God is embodied in Christ, Christ is the righteousness of God. The living person of Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness has been wrought into us, and we have been put into Him (1 Cor. 1:30). We have been mingled together with Christ as one. Thus, we have become the righteousness of God. We must proclaim, &ldquo;I am the righteousness of God. I have been justified. God is righteousness, and I also am righteous. I am the righteousness of God in Christ. I am what God is. I am fully justified.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head4">b. God Having Set Forth Christ<br />
as the Propitiation Place through Faith<br />
in His Blood to Show Forth God&rsquo;s Righteousness</h2>
<p>Romans 3 reveals that Christ is not only the Redeemer but also the propitiation place. Romans 3:25 tells us that God set forth Christ &ldquo;as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred.&rdquo; To propitiate is to conciliate two parties and make them one. It is to reconcile two parties, one of which has offended the other or has become indebted to the other. Because of this problem or debt, the offended party has a demand upon the offending party, and unless his demand is satisfied, the problem between them cannot be resolved, nor can reconciliation be achieved. When these two parties have been separated and seek to be in oneness, there is the need for propitiation&mdash;the need to reconcile one by satisfying the other&rsquo;s demand.</p>
<p>Propitiation means to make us one with God because there had been a separation between us and God. The problem that kept us from God, that made it impossible for us to have direct fellowship with Him, was our sins. Our sins kept us away from God&rsquo;s presence and hindered God from coming to us. Therefore, we needed propitiation to appease God&rsquo;s demands. Christ accomplished this on the cross when He made propitiation for our sins in order to reconcile us to God by satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous demands on us (Heb. 2:17). On the cross He offered Himself as the propitiatory sacrifice for our sins to solve our problems with God (1 John 2:2; 4:10). In His death He propitiated for us and brought us back to God, making us one with God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Propitiation Place</h2>
<p>Christ is the One who makes propitiation to God for us, He is the propitiatory sacrifice, and He is also the propitiation place where God can meet with His redeemed people. The propitiation place is typified in Exodus 25:17 by the sin-covering lid on the Ark. The Ark was the place where God met with people. Underneath the lid of the Ark was the law of the Ten Commandments exposing the sinfulness of the people and condemning them; above the lid of the Ark were the two cherubim representing God&rsquo;s glory and observing every action of the people. The exposing and condemning law signifies the requirements of God&rsquo;s holiness and His righteousness according to the law, and the observing cherubim signify the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory according to the expression of God. Unless these requirements were fulfilled and God was satisfied, there was no way for sinners to contact God and for God to communicate with them. However, by the lid of the Ark with the propitiating blood sprinkled on it on the Day of Expiation, the entire situation on the sinner&rsquo;s side was fully covered. The propitiating blood sprinkled upon the propitiation cover met the requirements of the righteous law and of God&rsquo;s glory. Therefore, upon this sin-covering lid God could meet with the people who broke His righteous law, and He could do this governmentally without any contradiction to His righteousness, even under the observing of the cherubim that bore His glory and overshadowed the lid of the Ark. Thus, the problem between man and God was appeased, enabling God to forgive and be merciful to man and thereby to give His grace to man. This is a prefigure of Christ as the Lamb of God taking away the sin that caused man to have a problem with God (John 1:29), thus satisfying all the requirements of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and glory and appeasing the relationship between man and God. Hence, God could pass over the people&rsquo;s sins that had previously occurred. Furthermore, in order to show forth His righteousness, God had to do this. This is what is referred to in Romans 3:25.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word for the lid of the Ark is <em>kapporeth,</em> from a root meaning &ldquo;to cover.&rdquo; In the Septuagint this word is translated <em>hilasterion,</em> which means &ldquo;the place of propitiation,&rdquo; implying to forgive and to give mercy. The word rendered &ldquo;propitious&rdquo; in Hebrews 8:12 is the root of <em>hilasterion,</em> and the word rendered &ldquo;propitiated&rdquo; in Luke 18:13 is derived from this root. The King James Version adopts the rendering &ldquo;mercy seat,&rdquo; referring to the place where God grants mercy to man. In Hebrews 9:5 Paul also used <em>hilasterion</em> for the lid of the Ark. Here, in Romans 3:25, the same word, <em>hilasterion,</em> is used to show that the lid of the Ark signifies Christ as the propitiation place set forth by God.</p>
<p>In addition to <em>hilasterion,</em> two other words derived from the same Greek word as <em>hilasterion</em> are used in the New Testament to show how Christ took away man&rsquo;s sin to appease the relationship between man and God. One is <em>hilaskomai</em> (Heb. 2:17), which means &ldquo;to propitiate,&rdquo; that is, to appease, to reconcile one by satisfying the other&rsquo;s demand; the other is <em>hilasmos</em> (1 John 2:2; 4:10), which means &ldquo;that which propitiates,&rdquo; that is, a propitiatory sacrifice. Christ made propitiation for our sins (Heb. 2:17); hence, He has become that which propitiates, the propitiatory sacrifice, between us and God (1 John 2:2; 4:10), and He has also become the place, as typified by the lid of the Ark (Heb. 9:5), where we enjoy propitiation before God and where God gives grace to us.</p>
<p>Christ as the propitiation place is where God is propitiated regarding the sinfulness of His people and where He takes away the problem between His people and Himself and reconciles them to Himself. Upon this propitiatory cover we have Christ as the propitiation between God and us, that is, the propitiating Christ who offered Himself as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins to settle the problem between us and God and to reconcile us to God. Furthermore, as the propitiatory cover, Christ is the place where we, the redeemed people, can meet and speak with our righteous, holy, and glorious God, and where we can hear His voice and learn the desire of His heart (Exo. 25:22).</p>
<p>Although many Christians love the Lord Jesus and realize that He is so much to them, they may not know that Christ is the propitiation place, where God can meet with us and where we can contact God. Before we knew of this place, we may have been frightened by the thought of approaching God; however, now we are no longer afraid of Him. Upon Christ as the propitiation place we can meet with God. Because we have such a Christ, we need not be troubled by anything. God&rsquo;s righteousness does not condemn us. On the contrary, His glory justifies us, and God Himself is happy, knowing that everything between us and Him is in harmony and that we can freely enjoy a mutually satisfying fellowship. Therefore, with Christ as the propitiatory cover, God is satisfied and we are happy; God and man can meet and have fellowship under a mutually satisfying situation.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) God&rsquo;s Setting Forth of Christ as the Propitiation Place</h2>
<p>God began to set forth Christ as the propitiation place at the time that darkness came over the whole land during His crucifixion, when He offered Himself as the unique sacrifice for sin, the reality of the sin offering (Luke 23:44; Heb. 9:26). Then on the third day God resurrected Him; this resurrection was also a part of the process of God&rsquo;s setting forth of Christ. After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, God received Christ into the heavens and placed Him at His right hand. This receiving and placing are also a part of the setting forth of Christ. God set forth Christ through the entire process of His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, in which He sat down at the right hand of God. This setting forth makes Christ Himself the propitiation place. God placed Christ, set forth Christ, as the propitiation place from the time that Christ shed His blood to the time that He ascended to sit at the right hand of God.</p>
<p>In His ascension Christ is the propitiation place, the propitiation cover, for God to meet with us. In Hebrews 4:16 this place is called the throne of grace. The throne of grace is the cover of the Ark on which Christ sprinkled the blood He shed on the cross for our redemption. Because of the sprinkling of His redeeming blood, the cover of the Ark has become a propitiation cover, a place where God may contact us and where we may enjoy His grace in full.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) Through Faith in His Blood</h2>
<p>A crucial phrase in Romans 3:25 is <em>faith in His blood</em>. The verse tells us that it is through faith in His blood that God set forth Christ as a propitiation place. The way to experience Christ as the propitiation place is by faith. We are justified through the redemption of Christ Jesus, that is, through faith in His blood. After offering Himself as the propitiatory sacrifice on the cross, Christ entered the heavenly Holy of Holies with His own blood and offered this blood before God, sprinkling it on the lid of the Ark, the propitiatory cover. For this reason, when we repented and believed in the Lord, we were put upon Christ as the propitiation place and had the deep sense that we were washed by the blood of Jesus Christ. Now whenever we meet with God upon Christ as the propitiation place, we have the sense deep within that we are washed by the blood of Christ. When we look at the redeeming blood on the propitiatory cover, our conscience is at peace. We know that Christ died for us and that the blood, the emblem of His death, has been sprinkled for us on the propitiatory cover to satisfy the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness. This is the propitiatory cover in our experience through faith in His blood.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) For Showing Forth God&rsquo;s Righteousness</h2>
<p>Through Christ as the propitiation and upon Him as the propitiatory cover, God has been altogether righteous in receiving repentant sinners to Himself. This is to show forth God&rsquo;s righteousness. On the cross God judged Christ and put Him to death because He took our place as our Substitute. By dying as the propitiatory sacrifice, Christ made the full propitiation on the cross for our sins and fully satisfied the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Now God not only can forgive us, but for the sake of His righteousness He must forgive us. By forgiving us God shows forth His righteousness. He makes a declaration to the universe that because He is righteous, He must forgive us of our sins. Because His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, was put to death by Him on the cross on our behalf, He is legally obligated to forgive us. If anyone believes in Christ, according to His righteousness God must be propitiated toward him, forgive him, and receive him.</p>
<p>If the Ark were without the propitiatory cover and a sinner were to come into the Holy of Holies to meet God, God would see the law of the Ten Commandments in the Ark. As a result, the sinner would be condemned, for he has broken the law of God. God would have no way to receive him. If God were to receive a sinner without the propitiatory cover with the blood sprinkled on it, He would make Himself unrighteous. Without the propitiatory cover, God has no way to forgive and receive repentant sinners. Thus, Christ came and died to be not only the sin offering and trespass offering for us, but also the sacrifice for our propitiation before God. God accepted the death of Christ as the propitiatory sacrifice, and God set forth Christ as the propitiation place, which covers the righteous requirement of the law. When we come to God upon Christ as the propitiation place, we and God see neither the requirements of His righteous law nor our sins; instead, we and God see only the redeeming blood on the propitiatory cover. Thus, there is no problem between us and God, and God must forgive us and receive us.</p>
<p>Now that we are upon Christ as the propitiation place, if God does not receive us, God will make Himself unrighteous. Therefore, we may tell God, &ldquo;You are righteous. You must receive me. Christ, my Savior, died for my sins as my Substitute. He also died as a propitiatory sacrifice for my sins. You have accepted His death, have resurrected Him from among the dead, and have set Him forth as the propitiation place. Now I come to meet You on Christ as my propitiation place, where You must justify me and receive me. You are righteous if You receive me, but You are unrighteous if You do not receive me.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s receiving of us based upon Christ as the propitiation place shows forth that God is righteous (1 John 1:9). Through Christ as the propitiation between us and God and upon Christ as the propitiation place, the righteousness of God can be applied to us; that is, God gives us His own righteousness, which is Christ Himself. We receive Christ, who was our Substitute, as our righteousness. Therefore, God has justified us. Now we have both God&rsquo;s righteousness and His justification. We are justified persons with Christ covering us as our righteousness. This is a great truth.</p>
<p>In summary, in this universe the Lord Jesus has been set forth as the propitiation place, and all sinners may come to meet God upon Him. Where are we today? We are on the propitiation place. We do have a position, a ground to meet with God, and God has the same ground to communicate with us. The law is under the propitiation cover, covered by the propitiating Christ. God&rsquo;s glory is above us, yet it has no claim against us because we are upon Christ as the propitiation place. The law is under our feet, and the glory of God over our head is satisfied. The law has been silenced; it can no longer speak against us, but the glory of God can rejoice over us with satisfaction. Here we are justified. On Christ as this propitiation cover we are the same as God in His righteousness. God approves us and God justifies us. Here upon the propitiation cover we enjoy God&rsquo;s full justification.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Factor of Our Justification</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Delivered on the Cross because of Our Offenses<br />
to Satisfy God&rsquo;s Righteous Requirements</h2>
<p>In Romans 4:25 we see that Christ is the factor of our justification: &ldquo;Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification.&rdquo; This verse first tells us that Christ was delivered up to die on the cross because of our offenses. This means that because we have offenses against God, Christ was delivered on the cross for us in order to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirements. Since the death of Christ has fulfilled and fully satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements, we are justified by God through His death (3:24).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Raised because of Our Justification</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) As a Proof of God&rsquo;s Satisfaction<br />
for God to Accept Us</h2>
<p>Romans 4:25 goes on to say that God raised Him from the dead for our justification. If God had not been satisfied with Christ&rsquo;s offering for us, how could God have raised Him from the dead? God&rsquo;s raising Christ is a strong proof that God was satisfied with Christ&rsquo;s dying for us and that we are justified by God because of Christ&rsquo;s death. Now God can accept us through Christ.</p>
<p>Suppose that Christ died for us and for our sins and was buried in the tomb but was not resurrected by God. If this were the situation, we could not believe that His death was accepted by God and that it satisfied God&rsquo;s requirements and fulfilled His desires. However, Christ is not in the tomb. God raised Him up from the dead, and He came back in resurrection. This is a strong proof that God has accepted His death for us, that His death satisfied God&rsquo;s requirements and fulfilled whatever God wanted Him to do for us. Therefore, the resurrection of Christ is the proof of our justification by God. In Christ, the resurrected One, we are justified.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) As the Resurrected Life for Us to Live a Life<br />
Justified by God and Acceptable to God</h2>
<p>Christ was raised not only as a proof that God accepted us through Christ but also as the resurrection life for us to live a life justified by God and acceptable to God. The resurrected Christ is in the third heavens at the right hand of God as conclusive evidence that all of God&rsquo;s requirements have been satisfied and that we have been thoroughly and adequately justified. However, this resurrected Christ is not only in the heavens but also within us to impart life that we may have a life of justification. By believing in Him, we have received Christ as our objective righteousness and are objectively justified before God. We have also received Christ as resurrection life that we can live by this life to have Christ lived out of us as our subjective righteousness; hence, we can be subjectively justified by God. The resurrected Christ enters into us that we may have the subjective justification. This resurrected Christ is living in us to be our life that we may live out a life of righteousness (Col. 1:27b; 3:4a). This is the subjective justification which we obtain through Christ&rsquo;s life. This subjective justification is our living by the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>Therefore, justification is not merely a positional matter; it is a dispositional matter. The death of Christ gave us a positional justification, and the resurrected Christ in the heavens is a proof of this. Now the resurrected Christ also lives inside us, living out a life of dispositional justification. Eventually, we are justified both in position and in disposition. We have not only an objective justification but a subjective justification as well. We may now live such a subjective, dispositional justification. Thus, as the factor of our justification, Christ was delivered on the cross because of our offenses in order to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirements. He then was raised because of our justification as a proof of God&rsquo;s satisfaction for God to accept us; He was raised also as the resurrected life for us to live a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God. Today Christ in resurrection is our justification.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">5. Our Peace toward God<br />
and Our Access into God&rsquo;s Grace</h2>
<p>In Romans 5:1-2 Christ is presented as our peace toward God and as our access into God&rsquo;s grace: &ldquo;Therefore having been justified out of faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Our Peace toward God</h2>
<p>We have Christ as our peace toward God after being justified by faith through our Lord Jesus Christ. We confessed our sins to God, received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, applied His blood, and were justified. Since we have been justified by faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior. Christ is our peace toward God; He is our peace moving within us and moving toward God. In 5:1 Paul used the word <em>toward,</em> not <em>with.</em> The preposition <em>toward</em> implies a kind of move. This means that we are still on the way toward God and that our journey into God through our being justified out of faith has not yet been completed. In the spiritual world, we first enter the gate of justification and then walk along the way. Justification by faith is the opening of the gate, giving us access, an entry, into a wide field of enjoyment. Once we have passed through the gate of justification, we need to walk the way of peace. If we are moving in a certain direction and do not sense the peace within, we should stop. We should always go along with the peace. After we have been saved, we must go our way in peace (Luke 7:50). Wherever we go, we must take the way of peace; whatever we do, we must do it in peace. In this way we experience and enjoy Christ as our peace moving within us and moving toward God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Our Access into God&rsquo;s Grace</h2>
<p>Christ is our peace toward God after we have been justified by faith through Him, and Christ is our access into God&rsquo;s grace, which access we have obtained through Him by faith. In this grace we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Through Him by Faith</h2>
<p>It is by faith that we have obtained our access into God&rsquo;s grace through Christ. The faith that justifies us and cuts off the flesh with its natural energy and effort also gives us access into God&rsquo;s grace. If we remain in the flesh with its natural effort, we will neither know nor enjoy the grace of God, but if we live by faith, we will enter into the full enjoyment of God&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p>Faith first gives us access into grace, then a solid standing in grace. Grace is the Triune God Himself, processed that we may enter into Him and enjoy Him. Grace, in the deepest sense, is the Triune God as our enjoyment. It is more than unmerited favor and more than mere outward blessing. We are not merely under God&rsquo;s blessing; we are in His grace.</p>
<p>Grace is the realm in which we stand. We must stand in grace. Whenever we sense that we are out of the realm of grace, we must return to it immediately and stand there. When we sense that we have moved from the realm of grace into another sphere, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. Bring me back to the realm of grace.&rdquo; We return to the realm of grace by the same way through which we entered it originally. We entered the realm of grace through justification by faith. God&rsquo;s justification brought us into this grace in which we stand. Whenever we act wrongly and sense that we are out of grace, we must pray: &ldquo;O Lord, forgive me. Cleanse me with Your precious blood.&rdquo; When we do this, we will be brought back to grace instantly.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) In This Grace We Stand and Boast<br />
because of the Hope of the Glory of God</h2>
<p>In the realm of grace we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God. This indicates that our hope is that we will be brought into the glory of God, that is, into His expression. Although we stand in grace and walk in peace, we are not yet in glory, but the day will come when we shall be brought into glory. The hope of the glory of God will be fully realized in the coming millennial kingdom, where Christ will be revealed as our glory. Today we are in the hope of this coming glory. This is our experience and enjoyment of Christ as our peace toward God and our access into God&rsquo;s grace.</p><h2 class="head3">6. The Redeemer, the Reconciler,<br />
and the Life-Savior</h2>
<p>In Romans 5:8-11 we see Christ as the Redeemer, the Reconciler, and the Life-Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Redeemer</h2>
<p>In Romans 5:8-9 Paul says, &ldquo;God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified in His blood, we will be saved through Him from the wrath.&rdquo; These verses reveal that Christ as the Redeemer has died for us, the sinners, and that having been justified in His blood, we will be saved through Him from the wrath.</p>
<p>The word <em>redeem</em> means to purchase back something that originally was ours but that had become lost. In other words, redemption means to repossess at a cost. We originally belonged to God; we were His possession. However, we were lost. Nevertheless, God did not give us up. He paid the price to have us back, repossessing us at a great cost. Because we were lost, we had many problems with God with respect to His righteousness, holiness, and glory. We were under a threefold demand, the demand of righteousness, holiness, and glory. Many requirements were laid upon us, and it was impossible for us to fulfill them. The price was too great. God paid the price for us, repossessing us at a tremendous cost. Christ died on the cross to accomplish eternal redemption for us (Gal. 3:13; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 10:12; 9:28). His blood has obtained eternal redemption for us (vv. 12, 14; 1 Pet. 1:18-19).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Reconciler</h2>
<p>Romans 5:10a reveals that Christ reconciled us to God through His death: &ldquo;For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son.&rdquo; This verse indicates that before man receives God&rsquo;s salvation, in God&rsquo;s eyes man is not only a sinner but also an enemy of God. Through the fall, man has fallen not only into sin but also under the authority of Satan (1 John 5:19). Hence, he has become a child of the devil (3:8a, 10), obeying the ruler of the authority of the air (Eph. 2:2). Being hostile to God, he has also become an enemy of God. Furthermore, the mind of fallen man is set on the evil flesh. Such a mind is hated by God, and it is enmity against God (Rom. 8:5, 7). Therefore, man needs to be reconciled to God.</p>
<p>In Romans 5:10 Paul says that we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, and in Colossians 1:20 we see that this reconciliation was &ldquo;through the blood of His cross.&rdquo; We were reconciled to God through the death of God&rsquo;s Son as the propitiation for the believers&rsquo; sins. First John 2:2 says, &ldquo;He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins (Heb. 9:28), not only for our redemption but also for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. In Christ as our Substitute, through His vicarious death, God is satisfied and appeased. Hence, Christ is the propitiation between God and us (1 John 4:10). Hebrews 2:17 tells us that Christ made propitiation for our sins. The Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to appease God&rsquo;s righteousness and thereby to reconcile us to God by satisfying the demand of His righteousness. Since Christ made propitiation for our sins, 1 Corinthians 15:3 says plainly, &ldquo;Christ died for our sins.&rdquo; Through His death, with the shedding of His blood on the cross, we have been reconciled to God.</p>
<p>Romans 5:10 tells us that before we were saved, we were not only sinners but also enemies. As sinners we needed justification; as enemies we needed reconciliation. Enmity is the greatest problem between God and man. Through the redeeming death of Christ, God has justified us, the sinners, and has reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself. We were reconciled to God when we believed in the Lord Jesus. By faith we have received God&rsquo;s justification and reconciliation. Therefore, our being reconciled to God is based on Christ&rsquo;s redemption and was accomplished through God&rsquo;s justification (3:24; 2 Cor. 5:18-19). Reconciliation is the issue of redemption with justification.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Life-Savior</h2>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Saving Us in His Life</h2>
<p>Romans 5:10b further shows that Christ is also the Life-Savior saving us in His life: &ldquo;Much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled.&rdquo; We have been reconciled to God through the death of His Son in order to be saved in His life. Being reconciled to God through Christ&rsquo;s death is an accomplished matter, but being saved in His life from so many negative things is a daily matter. On the one hand, we have been reconciled to God; on the other hand, we still need to be saved in the life of God&rsquo;s Son. Christ as the Redeemer and the Reconciler died for us once for all, but Christ as the Life-Savior is for our entire life. As long as we are on this earth, we are under the saving of our Savior&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s complete salvation is of two aspects&mdash;the judicial aspect and the organic aspect. God&rsquo;s judicial redemption is the judicial aspect of God&rsquo;s complete salvation. It is according to the righteousness of God, and it is the procedure of God&rsquo;s salvation to satisfy the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteous law on sinners (1:17a; 3:21-26; 5:10a; Gal. 3:13; 1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:12). God&rsquo;s organic salvation is the organic aspect of God&rsquo;s complete salvation. It is carried out by the life of God and is the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation, accomplishing all that He desires to achieve in the believers in His economy (Rom. 1:17b; 5:10b, 17b, 18b, 21b). In His humanity Christ accomplished God&rsquo;s judicial redemption through His death; in His divinity Christ is carrying out God&rsquo;s organic salvation in His resurrection. God&rsquo;s judicial redemption is the foundation of His organic salvation; His judicial redemption is the procedure of His complete salvation for the believers to participate in His organic salvation as the purpose of His complete salvation.</p>
<p>To be saved in Christ&rsquo;s life is to be saved in Christ Himself as life. He dwells in us, and we are organically one with Him. By the growth of His life in us, we will enjoy His full salvation to the uttermost. Redemption, justification, and reconciliation are for the purpose of bringing us into union with Christ so that He can save us in His life unto glorification (8:30).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) For Us to Boast, Exult, and Glory in God through Him</h2>
<p>The life of Christ within us not only saves us throughout our entire lifetime but also causes us to boast, exult, and glory in God. In 5:11 Paul says, &ldquo;Not only so, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.&rdquo; To boast and exult is to be beside ourselves with joy; it means to have God as our boast and our exultation, indicating that God is our enjoyment and our rejoicing. It is in boasting, in exulting, and in enjoying in this way that we are being saved in the life of Christ. It is worthwhile for us to boast, exult, and glory in God through Christ. Christ is the Life-Savior, saving us in His life and causing us to boast, exult, and glory in God through Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">7. The One Man</h2>
<p>In Romans 5:15b-21a Christ is presented as the one man through whom we receive the grace of God and the gift in grace for our justification that we may have life and reign in life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Grace of God and the Gift in Grace<br />
of the One Man Having Abounded to Many</h2>
<p>Romans 5:15b says, &ldquo;For if by the offense of the one the many died, much more the grace of God and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ have abounded to the many.&rdquo; This verse reveals that grace&mdash;the Triune God Himself as our enjoyment&mdash;and the free gift in grace of the one man&mdash;the gift of righteousness given to us by God&mdash;have abounded to the many. Here grace is of God, and the gift is related to Christ, for the free gift in grace is of the one man Jesus Christ. God never gives us grace directly; He always gives us grace through Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Unto Justification out of Many Offenses Being<br />
Justification of Life to All Men</h2>
<p>The grace of God and the gift in grace of the one man have abounded to the many unto justification out of many offenses. Romans 5:16b says, &ldquo;The gracious gift is out of many offenses unto justification.&rdquo; Here the gracious gift refers to the gift of righteousness, which we have received from God (v. 17). Furthermore, the justification out of many offenses mentioned in verse 16 is the justification of life to all men mentioned in verse 18. Christ&rsquo;s righteous act of dying on the cross resulted in justification of life. Verse 21 says that grace reigns through righteousness unto life. These verses show that life comes as the result of righteousness (8:10). Life is the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation; thus, justification is &ldquo;of life&rdquo; (5:18). Justification is not an end in itself; it is for life. <em>Life</em> in verse 18 refers to the eternal, divine, uncreated life of God (Heb., <em>zoe</em>), which is Christ Himself as life to us. Through justification we have come up to the standard of God&rsquo;s righteousness and correspond with it, so that now He can impart His life to us. Justification changes our outward position; life changes our inward disposition. Justification unto life indicates that justification results in life and that the organic union of life is an issue of justification. The grace of God and the gift in grace of the one man are for our justification, and our justification is for us to have the divine life that we may live it out.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) That Many May Reign in Life through Him</h2>
<p>The grace of God and the gift in grace of Christ abounded to the many unto justification of life to all men that many would reign in life through Christ. In Romans 5:17 Paul says, &ldquo;If, by the offense of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The goal of being justified is to have life and reign in life. We are saved in life to the extent that the life we have received enthrones us as kings to reign over all things. God&rsquo;s complete salvation is for us to reign in life by the abundance of grace&mdash;God Himself as our all-sufficient supply for our organic salvation&mdash;and of the gift of righteousness&mdash;God&rsquo;s judicial redemption applied to us in a practical way. Those who receive the abundance of grace are able to reign in life, for life issues out of the abundance of grace. We have received righteousness objectively, but we still need to continually receive the abundance of grace so that we can reign in life subjectively.</p>
<p>God causes the believers to have life that they may reign in life, subduing the insubordination of sin, death, and all the negative things belonging to sin and death. To reign in life is to be under the ruling of the divine life. Thus, today there is the need for all the believers who have received the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to practice the life of restriction and limitation in the divine life.</p>
<p>To reign in life is to rule as kings. To reign is to conquer, subdue, and rule over Satan, the world, sin, the flesh, ourselves, and all our environmental circumstances. In Romans 8 Paul says, &ldquo;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?&rdquo; (v. 35). Then he goes on to say, &ldquo;We more than conquer through Him who loved us&rdquo; (v. 37). Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ because we are more than conquerors over all the troubles in our environment. We should conquer all things and reign in life by grace. Our Christian life today should not only be a victorious and overcoming life; it should also be a kingly and reigning life. This should be our experience today. Instead of waiting for the millennium in order to reign with Christ, we should desire to reign in life as kings today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to reign is to be God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. In the universe only God reigns and only He is the King, but we as the children of this King can also reign in His life. God reigns and we reign. Since we reign as God does, by reigning in life we become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Through the Obedience of the One<br />
the Many Being Constituted Righteous</h2>
<p>Romans 5:19 continues, &ldquo;For just as through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous.&rdquo; On the cross Christ obeyed God even unto death (Phil. 2:8). God recognized the death of Christ on the cross as obedience and a righteous act. Through this one obedient act of Christ, the many, that is, the believers, will be constituted righteous. The obedience of Christ has constituted us righteous; that is, through His obedience, grace&mdash;God personified&mdash;comes to give us life and enjoyment. When Christ, the living God, comes into our being as grace, we are constituted righteous. We were constituted sinful, but now we are reconstituted righteous.</p>
<p>Whether we are sinners or are righteous depends not on our actions but on our inward constitution. Through his fall Adam received an element that was not created by God. This was the satanic nature, which became the constituting essence and main element of fallen man. It is this constituting essence and element that constituted all men sinners. We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners. Whether we do good or evil, in Adam we have been constituted sinners. This is due to our inward element, not our outward actions.</p>
<p>In contrast, Christ constitutes us righteous. When He, the living God, comes into our being as grace for our enjoyment, we are constituted righteous. He becomes the constituting essence and element in us that can transform us from sinners into sons of God. He alone is able to accomplish such a reconstituting work.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. That Grace, Having Superabounded, Might Reign through Righteousness unto Eternal Life<br />
through Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Romans 5:20-21 continues, saying that grace, having superabounded, &ldquo;might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; The preceding points revealed in Romans 5:15-19 are expressed in the following sentence: The grace of God and the gift in grace of Christ justify us that we may have the divine life and reign in life. God has grace, and He desires to give us His grace through Christ. God&rsquo;s grace with the gift in grace of Christ&mdash;the gift of righteousness&mdash;has justified us that we may have life and reign in life. Through the obedience of Christ, He as grace has come into us to constitute us righteous persons. Now grace has superabounded in order that it might reign in us, that is, that it might rule in us as a king through righteousness, which we have received, unto eternal life. It is unto eternal life that the grace of God with the gift of Christ has justified us. The abounding grace brings us into the experience of the eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Through Righteousness</h2>
<p>It is through righteousness that grace reigns unto eternal life. Righteousness is the footing, the base, and the means for God to dispense Himself to us as grace. This righteousness gives us the ground to claim God as our grace. We may say, &ldquo;Lord, You cannot withhold Yourself from me as grace, because I stand on the ground of justification. You have given Christ to be my righteousness as a gift, and I stand on this position. Lord, give Yourself to me as grace for my enjoyment.&rdquo; By giving grace to us, God manifests His righteousness (1:17). Furthermore, the power of this grace operates in us and produces subjective righteousness, making us right with God, with others, and even with ourselves; and it not only subdues sin but also overcomes Satan and death in our being. Thus, grace reigns through righteousness, resulting in eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Unto Eternal Life</h2>
<p>The grace of God has superabounded that it might reign in us unto eternal life. On the one hand, according to 5:17, we will reign, that is, we will reign in life by the abundance of grace. On the other hand, according to verse 21, grace reigns, that is, grace reigns in us unto eternal life. Hence, grace reigns in us, and we reign through grace. For grace to reign unto eternal life means that grace reigns over us and over everything so that we can enjoy the eternal life; the reign of grace results in eternal life. It is in this eternal life that we shall reign. <em>Unto</em> in verse 21 means &ldquo;for.&rdquo; Grace reigns for the eternal life. This indicates that we may gain eternal life for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Moreover, for grace to reign unto eternal life means that we are now enthroned as kings and are reigning in life over all things unto an issue, a consummation. The issue of our present reigning in life will be the New Jerusalem as the universal incorporation of God and man. Revelation 22:5 says, &ldquo;They will reign forever and ever.&rdquo; That reigning is an issue&mdash;a glorious, eternal, corporate consummation of our present reigning in life through the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness unto eternal life. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is the fulfillment of the word in Romans 5:21 that grace reigns unto eternal life. It will be a strong testimony of the consummation of the divine life carried out by grace. Grace reigning unto eternal life means that grace reigns to bring in the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is grace reigning. Grace as God will reign in the New Jerusalem; hence, the New Jerusalem is the consummation of God reigning as grace.</p>
<p>Romans 5:12-21 gives us a comparison between sin and grace; there are two lines with two issues and two results. Verses 15 and 16 clearly show a comparison between the offense and the gift. These verses help us to understand that in Romans 5:12-21 there is a comparison between two lines, that is, the line of Satan and the line of God. The former is the line of sin with the issue of offenses and the result of death; the latter is the line of grace with the issue of the gift and the result of life and unto eternal life.</p>
<p>On the one hand, sin is of Satan. In a very real sense, sin is Satan personified; it is nothing less than Satan himself (v. 12; 7:11, 13, 20). Out of sin issue offenses, and offenses result in death (5:15, 17). Here we have Satan, sin, offenses, and death. On the other hand, grace is of God. In fact, grace is God personified; it is nothing less than God Himself for our enjoyment (John 1:17; Gal. 2:20; cf. 1 Cor. 15:10). Out of grace issues the gift, and the gift results in justification not only of life but eventually unto eternal life (Rom. 5:17, 21). Here we have God, grace, the gift, justification of life, and justification unto eternal life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, sin reigns in death, whereas grace reigns in life and unto life. Here we see two results. The result of the line of Satan is death; the result of the line of God is life&mdash;it is both of life and unto life. Sin reigns by the authority of death and brings in death by its reign. Thus, a sinner must die. Once we were in the kingdom of death, and sin was our king through death. Now we are in another kingdom, the kingdom of life, and Christ as grace is our King. This grace reigns through righteousness, resulting in eternal life, a life which will transform our whole being, sanctify us completely, and deal thoroughly with our disposition. Thus, we will become sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified persons. This is the enjoyment and experience of Christ as the grace of God and the gift of God.</p>
<p>In Christ, through His one righteous act, we may receive justification of life and unto life. We can even reign by His grace and by the gift of righteousness (v. 17), and grace reigns in us (v. 21). When we reign, grace reigns; when grace reigns, we reign. In fact, grace and we are one entity, and this grace is the personification of the Triune God. Today the Triune God is our grace for our enjoyment that we may experience justification by faith, justification of life, and justification unto life.</p>
<p>There are five crucial words in Romans 5:15-21: grace, gift, justification, life, and reign. The grace of God and the gift of the one man Jesus Christ are for our justification, and justification is for us to have the divine life that we may reign in life. In other words, the grace of God and the gift of Christ, the gift of righteousness, are for our justification unto life that we may have life, live it out, and live in a reigning way.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED NINETY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">8. The Christ Who Died and Resurrected</h2>
<p>Romans 6 presents the Christ who died and resurrected for our experience and enjoyment. We may experience and enjoy Christ in His death and resurrection. The result of such an enjoyment is the free gift in Christ, that is, eternal life. Verse 23 thus says, &ldquo;The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; Here eternal life is not merely a life we receive once and for all; it implies and involves many matters for our daily experience and enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Believers Having Been Baptized into Him,<br />
Even into His Death</h2>
<p>Romans 6:3 says, &ldquo;All of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death.&rdquo; The believers have been baptized into Christ, even into His death. Baptism is not a form or a ritual; it signifies our identification with Christ. Through baptism we are immersed into Christ, taking Him as our realm, that we may be united with Him as one in His death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) Baptized into Him</h2>
<p>Romans 6:3, which speaks of our having been baptized into Christ, is the strongest support for the thought of the organic union in Christ, the organic union we have with Christ. We can never enjoy and experience Christ without being baptized into Christ. We were born in one person, Adam, but when we believed and were baptized, we entered into another person, Christ. Whether we were good or bad, we were born in Adam. By being baptized into Christ, we entered into Christ and became a part of Him. The meaning of baptism is to put the believers into Christ. Baptism, therefore, is an extremely significant experience, for in it a transfer takes place. Baptism is an act in which we put the members of Adam into death, thereby transferring them out of Adam into Christ. This means that we have been baptized out of one realm, one sphere, into another realm, another sphere, that is, out of Adam, the first man (1 Cor. 15:45a, 47a), into Christ (1:30; Gal. 3:27), the second man (1 Cor. 15:47). Even the King James Version uses the word <em>into</em> in Romans 6:3. Christ is a realm, a sphere, into which we have been baptized. Now we are in Him, He is our enjoyment, and He is the very One whom we can experience.</p>
<p>We should praise the Lord that we have been baptized into Christ. Although we were born in Adam, by baptism we have been identified with Christ in His death and resurrection. Through death and resurrection Christ was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. Even Christ Himself needed death and resurrection to be transformed from the flesh to the Spirit. Likewise, through identification with Christ in His death and resurrection, we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ. When we were baptized into Christ, we were transferred from being a part of Adam into being a part of Christ. Now we are no longer in Adam&mdash;we are absolutely in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Baptized into His Death</h2>
<p>In 6:3 we see that when we were baptized into Christ Jesus, we were baptized also into the death of Christ. On the one hand, we have been baptized into Christ&rsquo;s person; on the other hand, we have been baptized into His death. His death has separated us from the world and the satanic power of darkness and has terminated our natural life, our old nature, our self, our flesh, and even our entire history.</p>
<p>It is significant that in 6:3 Paul says that we have been baptized not into Christ&rsquo;s resurrection but into His death. The resurrected Christ still bears in Himself the effectiveness of His death. Otherwise, we could not be baptized into His death by being baptized into Him. The fact that we are baptized into Christ and into His death indicates that Christ and His death are one. The resurrection of Christ carries the element of His effective death. Thus, when a believer is baptized into Christ, he is spontaneously baptized into the death of Christ. It is impossible to separate Christ&rsquo;s death from Christ Himself. The being of the resurrected Christ includes the element of His effective death. The effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death is one of the ingredients of His all-inclusive being. Therefore, to be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into His death.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous difference between death in Adam and the death of Christ. We loathe death in Adam, but we appreciate the sweetness of Christ&rsquo;s death. Christ&rsquo;s death is dear and lovable, and we may abide restfully in it. How wonderful that a believer baptized into the all-inclusive Christ is also placed into the death of Christ! In the words of a hymn written by A. B. Simpson, &ldquo;It is so sweet to die with Christ&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #482). Rest and victory are found in Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Every candidate for baptism is a person in the process of dying. Through baptism such a person is put to death. Having been identified with Christ and His death, he is immersed in water and is buried. Through baptism he enters into the actual experience of death with Christ.</p>
<p>The Christian life is a life of baptism. On the one hand, baptism has been accomplished; on the other hand, baptism continues until we are fully transformed and conformed to the image of Christ. Hence, until this goal has been attained, we continue to live a life of baptism. This means that we are daily under the application of the death of Christ as we experience the effectiveness of His death, which is now one of the ingredients, the elements, in the all-inclusive Spirit. In our daily life we may experience the putting to death of the negative elements within us. This takes place not by doctrine or by a particular practice but by the killing element in the death of Christ included in the all-inclusive Spirit.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Believers Having Been Buried with Him<br />
through Baptism into Death</h2>
<p>The believers have been buried with Christ through baptism into death. Romans 6:4 says, &ldquo;We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death.&rdquo; Here Paul introduces the thought of burial, indicating that we may experience Christ in His burial. In the natural realm death always comes before burial, but in the spiritual realm burial comes before death. When we were baptized, we were buried with Christ. When we were buried with Him, we entered into His death. We do not die directly; we enter into Christ&rsquo;s death through baptism.</p>
<p>Suppose a certain person repents and believes in the Lord Jesus. He should then be baptized into Christ. To baptize this new believer into Christ is to put him into the death of Christ. When he is baptized, he is actually buried. This burial results in death. This is what it means to be buried with Christ through baptism into His death.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Believers,<br />
Having Been Resurrected as Christ Was,<br />
Should Walk in Newness of Life</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the believers, having been resurrected as Christ was, should walk in newness of life. Romans 6:4 continues, &ldquo;Just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life.&rdquo; We were buried with Christ into His death, and now we have been resurrected as He was. Hence, we should walk in newness of life. This newness of life is very much related to the life-giving Spirit, who is Christ Himself in His resurrection. The way to walk in newness of life is the Spirit.</p>
<p>When we are immersed in the water, we enter into death, but when we come out of the water, we enter into resurrection. We all need to have such a wonderful realization and understanding of baptism. After baptism we become a new person in resurrection. Resurrection is not only a future state; it is also a present process. To walk in newness of life means to live today in the realm of resurrection and to reign in life. This kind of living deals with all that is of Adam in us until we are fully transformed and conformed to the image of Christ (8:29).</p>
<p>In fact, the newness of life mentioned in 6:4 is the likeness of His resurrection mentioned in verse 5. We all should walk in this newness of life. We must see that we have grown together with Christ in the likeness of His death, that is, in baptism, and that we will grow together with Him in the likeness of His resurrection, that is, in the newness of His resurrected life. This means that we must see that we have died with Him and that we are now growing with Him. We were buried with Him in baptism, and we are now growing with Him in His resurrection, in His divine life. We must walk according to this vision; that is, we must walk in newness of life. In our daily life and our meetings, we need to live, behave, act, work, and do everything in newness of life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Believers, Having Grown Together with Him<br />
in the Likeness of His Death (Baptism),<br />
Will Grow Together with Him<br />
Also in the Likeness of His Resurrection</h2>
<p>Romans 6:5 reveals a crucial point of truth: the believers, having grown together with Christ in the likeness of His death, will grow together with Him also in the likeness of His resurrection. This verse includes two steps of our growth in Christ. The first step has already taken place, whereas the second step is progressive. On the one hand, we have grown together with Christ in baptism; on the other hand, we will be growing together with Him in the likeness of His resurrection, that is, in the newness of life.</p><h2 class="head5">(1) The Believers Having Grown Together with Him<br />
in the Likeness of His Death (Baptism)</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.&rdquo; The phrase <em>likeness of His death</em> in this verse refers to the baptism mentioned in the previous verse. Baptism is the likeness of the death of Christ. In baptism, we have grown together with Christ. The phrase <em>growntogether</em> has presented a challenge to many translators. However, if we adhere to the meaning of the Greek word, there will be no difficulty. The Greek word translated as &ldquo;grown together&rdquo; is used in Luke 8:7 to speak of the thorns that grew up together with the wheat. Similarly, we have grown together with Christ. When we were baptized into Christ, in one sense we were put to death; in another sense we began to grow. This very much resembles the sowing of a seed into the earth. Apparently, the seed is sown; actually, it begins to grow. When we were placed in the water, we were like a seed planted in soil. Baptism is the best soil for spiritual growth. By being baptized into Christ we have all grown together with Christ in the likeness of His death.</p>
<p>According to Romans 6:5, Paul regards baptism as a step in our growth in life. In baptism we were not only buried into death, but we also began to grow. This is a fact, even though we cannot adequately understand it with our human mind. The important point is that to be baptized is to grow together with Christ.</p>
<p>The growth of Christ in the believers is a mystery, just as matters related to life are always a mystery. Baptism is a process of growth similar to the process of human growth in the mother&rsquo;s womb, which is initiated with human conception, continues for nine months, and consummates with delivery. It is marvelous that just as in human conception fetuses grow into the likeness of their parents, in baptism the believers grow with Christ in the likeness of His death. We should not despise that moment when the believers are put into and pass through water, for at that moment they are growing with Christ in the likeness of His death. After their baptism is completed, they have grown together with Christ in the likeness of His death. Baptism is not an insignificant matter. Regardless of how formal a baptism might be, baptizing people into Jesus Christ results in a great change&mdash;the Spirit causes the growth of Christ in the baptized believer.</p>
<p>When we preach Christ Jesus, we have to realize that in the word we preach, there is the Spirit. The Spirit accompanies our preaching of the word. When we preach the word, we must have faith that we are preaching the word of Jehovah, the word of the living God, and the word of Jesus Christ. Moreover, the word is the Spirit (John 6:63). When we preach the word to others, lead them to salvation, and baptize them into the water, the Holy Spirit will honor this baptism by causing the growth of Christ within them. When a sinner hears the gospel, believes, prays, and acknowledges salvation by recognizing that he is a saved person, we should put him into the water of baptism. Being baptized into the water is a sign indicating that he is being baptized into the processed Triune God, that is, immersed into the union with the Triune God. For him to be put into the Triune God in this way is for him to grow with Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:19). Therefore, after a new convert believes in the Lord Jesus, we should baptize him immediately, believing in the effectiveness of baptism.</p>
<p>Although the significance of baptism is quite meaningful, very few who are baptized today truly appreciate its significance. When we go to contact people to preach the gospel, we must have the faith that the gospel we are preaching is the living word. The living Spirit goes with us. The living word of God and the living Spirit of Christ are one, and they are one with us. We must exercise our faith to believe that when we open our mouth to preach the word of God, the Spirit of Christ will work along with this word. Then we follow the Lord&rsquo;s instruction to baptize the new believers into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). Through baptism, these believers will grow together with Christ in the likeness of His death.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) The Believers Growing Together with Him<br />
Also in the Likeness of His Resurrection</h2>
<p>Romans 6:5 also indicates that we will grow with Christ also in the likeness of His resurrection. This does not refer to a future, objective resurrection but to the present process of growth. When we were baptized, we grew together with Christ in the likeness of His death; now, through His death we are growing into His resurrection. Just as the element of Christ&rsquo;s death is found only in Him, so the element of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is found only in Christ Himself. He Himself is resurrection (John 11:25). After experiencing a proper baptism, we continue to grow in and with Christ in the likeness of His resurrection, that is, to walk in newness of life.</p>
<p>Although the deep aspects of this truth have been lost to many Christians, Frederic Louis Godet, a famous expositor of the New Testament, has suggested in his <em>Commentary on Romans</em> that the growth revealed in Romans 6:5 is related to the notion of grafting. He translated this verse: &ldquo;For if we have become one and the same plant [with Him] through the likeness of His death, we shall be also partakers of His resurrection.&rdquo; According to Godet, the word grown denotes &ldquo;the organic union in virtue of which one being shares the life, growth, and phases of existence belonging to another.&rdquo; Through the organic union of two trees, accomplished by grafting, the one tree partakes of the life and characteristic of the other tree. Applying this understanding to our spiritual experience, we may say that we have been grafted into the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; of Christ, the Son of God, as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Having become one with Him through grafting, we now partake of the life and characteristics of Him as the all-inclusive One, and in this way we grow in Him.</p>
<p>In this grafting, that is, in the organic union with Christ, whatever Christ passed through has become our history. His death and resurrection are now ours because we are in Him and are organically joined to Him. Such a grafting discharges all our negative elements, resurrects our God-created faculties, uplifts our faculties, enriches our faculties, and saturates our entire being to transform us.</p>
<p>We need to see the two aspects of grafting and growing together revealed in Romans 6:5: &ldquo;For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.&rdquo; The first aspect is &ldquo;in the likeness of His death&rdquo; and refers to our being grafted into Him. The second is &ldquo;in the likeness of His resurrection&rdquo; and refers to His coming into us to grow in us. In order for grafting to take place, both trees must experience cutting. This cutting signifies the experience of being put to death. The initial grafting is related to the Lord&rsquo;s death. He is the true vine. In His crucifixion Christ was thoroughly cut, and He still bears the marks of this cutting. This means that within the being of the resurrected Christ, there is an opening into which we can be grafted. Now His cut wound is waiting for the repentant sinners; His side has been pierced and His blood has been shed. However, if we would be grafted into Him, we too must be cut. Hence, we were cut on the cross as well. We experience this cutting when we repent and receive the Lord. Now Christ as the life-giving Spirit moves in us, searching our inner being, enlightening us so that we repent. Our grief and tears are the &ldquo;cut&rdquo; we receive. We have no choice but to believe in the Lord and ask Him to save us. Then we are joined to Him at the very place where both He and we have been cut. In a sense, the two cuts embrace each other. Through such an embrace, the grafting is accomplished, and the two trees&mdash;the crucified and resurrected Christ and the repentant sinners&mdash;become one tree. When we believe and are baptized, we are grafted into Him and grow together with Him in the likeness of His death. This grafting is the growing. It is not that we are grafted first, and then we begin to grow. Rather, we are grafted into Him in the likeness of His death and grow together with Him at the same time.</p>
<p>Once we are thus grafted into Him, His resurrection life comes into us and removes all the negative elements within. His life becomes ours in resurrection. He uplifts the original functions given to us at creation, and enriches, strengthens, and even saturates our whole being. This new life is a life of two lives grafted into one. In this union are victory, life, light, power, and all the other divine attributes. All these are ours by virtue of being grafted into Him. In this grafting we grow together with Him. Then in resurrection His life grows in us. The divine life is in us, supplying us. This is the Christian life.</p>
<p>In summary, grafting is the growing. Apparently grafting is a kind of cutting; actually this cutting is a kind of growth. When a tree is cut off and grafted into another tree, in this tree that is grafted we see both the cutting and the growing, that is, its growth through being cut. This is a picture of our growth in Christ by being buried into the death of Christ through baptism. This is to grow together with Christ in the likeness of His death, that is, to grow together with Christ in baptism. Therefore, to be baptized is to be grafted into Christ. This baptism involves growth.</p>
<p>After a person repents and believes in the Lord Jesus, he grows with Christ first in baptism, in the likeness of His death, and then in the likeness of His resurrection, in the newness of life. As a believer experiences a proper baptism, the divine Spirit within him puts to death the old man with his worldly, sinful elements. After he comes out of the water of baptism a new person, he begins to live and walk in the newness of life, in the newness of His resurrection. Therefore, he grows daily in the likeness of His resurrection and walks in newness of life. This is certainly the wonderful experience and enjoyment of the Christ who died and resurrected.</p><h2 class="head4">e. The Believers&rsquo; Old Man Having Been Crucified<br />
with HimThat the Body of Sin Might Be Annulled,<br />
That They Should No Longer Serve Sin as Slaves</h2>
<p>Romans 6:6 tells us that the believers&rsquo; old man has been crucified with Christ that the body of sin might be annulled, that they should no longer serve sin as slaves. The believers&rsquo; old man has been crucified with Him, that is, buried with Him into His death. Certainly we may participate in His death, which has annulled our old man and everything related to our old man, including our thinking, our likes, our dislikes, and our temper. Here our old man refers to the natural life in our soul. The old man is our very being, which was created by God but became fallen through sin; it is the same as the first &ldquo;I&rdquo; in Galatians 2:20. It is not the soul itself but the life of the soul which has been counted by God as hopeless and has been put on the cross and crucified with Christ. Formerly, our soul acted as an independent person, with the old man as its life and personality; now, since the old man has been crucified, our soul should act only as an organ of Christ and should be under the control of our spirit, having Christ as its life.</p>
<p>Our old man has been crucified by His death that our body of sin might be annulled. Because of the fall, our body is a body of sin. It is the body indwelt, occupied, corrupted, possessed, utilized, and enslaved by sin so that it does sinful things. This body of sin is very active and full of strength to commit sins. As such a fallen body, it is good only for committing sins. In this body there is nothing but sin. The sin dwelling in our body makes it the body of sin (Rom. 7:19-20). When a person dies, immediately his body loses its job. Likewise, because our old man has been crucified with Christ, the body of sin has lost its job of sinning. It has become of no effect because the sinning person, the old man, has been crucified. The body of sin is not the sinning person but the sinning instrument utilized by the old man to express himself by committing sins; it is the means by which the person does sinful things. However, now that the person, the old man, has been crucified, the body of sin is unemployed. Christ&rsquo;s death made the body of sin jobless and therefore of no effect. Because the body of sin has lost its job, we no longer need to serve sin as slaves. This means that we have been freed from sin. Since our old man has been crucified and buried with Christ, we have been freed from sin (6:18-22) and no longer need to be under the bondage of sin to serve sin as slaves.</p>
<p>The believers&rsquo; old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be of no effect, that they should no longer serve sin as slaves. Suppose that you are a slave. If you die, your body would be annulled. Spontaneously, you would no longer be under slavery; death would end your slavery. This is the way that we are freed from sin. The Bible never tells us to try to overcome sin by our striving, struggling, and endeavoring. Rather, it reveals that we are free from sin by the death of Christ. By being buried into the death of Christ, we die and our body of sin is annulled. Then we are no longer under slavery to serve sin as slaves; thus, we are freed from sin.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. The Believers, Having Died to Sin in Christ,<br />
Should Live, as Christ Lives, to God</h2>
<p>Romans 6:10 says, &ldquo;For the death which He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life which He lives, He lives to God.&rdquo; The believers, having died to sin in Christ, should live, as Christ lives, to God. To live to God means that we are under His direction and control and that we desire to fulfill His requirements, satisfy His desires, and complete what He intends.</p>
<p>Death in and of itself is terrible, but the positive side of death is that it leads to resurrection. The death of Christ led Him to resurrection. Our experience is the same. Once we die in Christ, His death leads us to His resurrection. For this reason, when we baptize people, we do not leave them under the water; rather, after we put them into the water, we immediately raise them up from the water, showing that they have been not only buried with Christ into His death but also raised together with Christ in His resurrection.</p>
<p>When we go into the water to be baptized, we enter into the death of Christ by faith, allowing ourselves, everything that belongs to us, and everything that is related to us to be buried in the tomb of the water of baptism, that is, in the burial of Christ. Then by faith we come out of the water, and in resurrection we allow the resurrected Christ to live in us that we may live by Him and with Him. Therefore, through baptism we have been identified with Christ&rsquo;s death, burial, and resurrection. His death and burial, on the negative side, terminated us and everything that is of us that we may be delivered from the self, sin, the world, and everything that is of the old creation, everything that is of Satan, and everything that is outside of God. His resurrection, on the positive side, has made us a new creation to partake of God&rsquo;s life and all its riches in Christ, and has brought us into a new realm of resurrection in which the old things have passed away and have become new. This is our experience and enjoyment of the Christ who died and resurrected.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">9. The New Husband</h2>
<p>Romans 7:2-6 reveals that Christ is the new Husband. As regenerated beings, both male and female believers have Christ as their Husband and are a part of His wife. Yet a great many believers, although they have been Christians for many years, may never have heard that they have Christ as their Husband. If we the believers do not know that we have Christ as our Husband, we are pitiful persons, for in effect, we are like widows, females who have lost their husbands. The word <em>widow</em> connotes pitifulness. A widow has been stripped and robbed of all her enjoyment; she has lost everything of the enjoyment of human life. Surely all genuine Christians have Christ as their Husband, yet it is pitiful that many of them do not know Him as their Husband.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.Our Old Man, the Old Husband,<br />
Having Been Crucified (Having Died) to the Law<br />
through the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Romans 7:2-4a says, &ldquo;For the married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living; but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law regarding the husband. So then if, while the husband is living, she is joined to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, though she is joined to another man. So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ.&rdquo; These verses show two husbands. The first husband (the old husband) is not the flesh or the law but the old man mentioned in 6:6, who has been crucified with Christ. The second husband (the new husband) mentioned in 7:2-4 is Christ.</p>
<p>Since our old man, who was the old husband, has been crucified with Christ (6:6), we are freed from his law and are joined to the new Husband, Christ, the ever-living One. As believers, we have two statuses. The first <em>you</em> in 7:4 refers to us in our old status as the fallen old man, who left the original position of a wife dependent on God and took the self-assuming position of a husband and head, independent of God. The second <em>you</em> in verse 4 refers to us in our new status as the regenerated new man, restored to our original and proper position as the genuine wife to God (Isa. 54:5; 1 Cor. 11:3), dependent on Him and taking Him as our Head. We no longer have the old status of the husband, for we have been crucified. We now have only the new status of the proper wife, in which we take Christ as our Husband, and should no longer live according to the old man, that is, no longer take the old man as our husband.</p>
<p>Because fallen man left his proper position as God&rsquo;s wife and desired to be the husband, God gave him the law, which he cannot possibly keep. The law is intended not for the wife but for the husband, and the law was given not that it might be kept but that the old man might be exposed (Rom 7:5; 3:20; 5:20). Paul thus refers to the law as &ldquo;the law regarding the husband&rdquo; (7:2).</p>
<p>We all had an old husband, the old man. When we were baptized into the death of Christ, we were identified with Him in His death, in which our old man was crucified and died. Through the death of our old man, the body of sin was annulled. Since the law was intended for and given to the old husband, the old man, the death of the old man also has made us dead to the law through the body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">b.That We Might Marry Another Husband, Christ,<br />
Who Has Been Raised from among the Dead</h2>
<p>Our old man has been crucified to the law through the body of Christ that we might marry another husband, Christ, who has been raised from among the dead. In Romans 7:4b, Paul says, &ldquo;That you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God.&rdquo; This joining indicates that in our new status as a wife, we have an organic union in person, name, life, and existence with Christ in His resurrection. Now we are married to Christ, our new Husband. In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul also tells us that he has betrothed the believers to one husband, Christ.</p>
<p>Since Christ is our Husband, we must depend on Him and take Him as our Head (Eph. 5:23). To take God as our Husband means to terminate all that we are, have, and do and to trust in God for everything. Taking Christ as our Husband also means that we believe in Christ. God&rsquo;s intention is to bring us back to Himself and to cause us to place our full trust in Him. No longer should we live by ourselves but by Christ. We must let Christ live for us. We should live no longer by ourselves, act by ourselves, or be anything in ourselves. We must be completely terminated, and our head must be completely covered. We are no longer the husband. We, as the old man, have been crucified. Christ is now our Husband.</p>
<p>Christ is not only our Head&mdash;He is also our person. We must even take Christ as our life (Col. 3:4). Christ is our Husband, our Head, our person, and our life. We have been terminated and have become nobody. Christ lives in us and for us. Therefore, we are fully under grace, no longer under law in any way. The law has nothing to do with us, and we have nothing to do with the law. &ldquo;For I through law have died to law&rdquo; (Gal. 2:19). Now in grace we are alive to God.</p>
<p>When a person believes and is baptized into the Triune God, he becomes involved with another person, that is, he marries another person, Christ. Before he believes and is baptized, he is involved with only one person, for he has only himself as his person, that is, his old man. However, once he believes and is baptized into the Triune God, he becomes involved with another person&mdash;the divine person who is our Redeemer, Reconciler, and Life-Savior. This wonderful person, God, became involved with us through the death and resurrection of Christ. In His death, we as the old man died, and in His resurrection, we as the regenerated new man were raised with Him. Since our old man has been crucified with Christ, we are freed from the law, which was given to the old man, and we are living to God. This is a great change.</p>
<p> According to their experience, many regenerated and baptized believers can testify to this change. Before a person believes into the Lord, he lives by the old man under the law. After he believes and is baptized, something within him begins to regulate him not to live in the old way. This inward regulation is, on the one hand, death to his old way of living and, on the other hand, the living of his regenerated new man, that is, his living to God. Since his old man has been crucified with Christ, he is freed from the law. Therefore, he now becomes a person who lives no longer to the law but to God. This marvelous change indicates that he has died to the law and now lives to the living God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. That We Might Bear Fruit to God</h2>
<p>Romans 7:4 tells us that as a wife we bear fruit to God. When we are in resurrection and always live to God, we bear fruit to God. When we were in the flesh, that is, when we were the old husband, everything related to us was death. All we could produce was death. Everything we brought forth was a fruit of death and to death. Now as a regenerated person, that is, as the wife, we bear fruit to God. This simply means that everything we do now is related to God, whereas formerly, whatever we were and whatever we did was death. Therefore, here we see a vivid contrast between death and God, between bearing fruit to death and bearing fruit to God. This shows that when we were the old man and the old husband, held under the law, everything we were and did was death. The result was fruit to death. As a new man and the wife married to a new husband, whatever we are and do is related to God. We bear fruit to God. The phrase <em>bear fruit to God</em> means that God comes forth, that God is brought forth as fruit. Thus, all we are and do must be the living God. We must bring forth God as an overflow of God. In this way we have the living God as our fruit and we bear fruit to God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Having Died to the Law in Which We Were Held,<br />
That We Might Be Discharged from It</h2>
<p>Romans 7:6 says, &ldquo;But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.&rdquo; Since the old man has been crucified, the regenerated new man is now free from the law of the old man (vv. 2-3; Gal. 2:19). Since the law was given to the old husband, the old man, not to the wife, and since the old husband, the old man, died on the cross, the new man, the wife, has been discharged from his law. Hence, we as the wife and the new man are no longer under the law.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. That We Should Serve as Slaves<br />
in Newness of Spirit<br />
and Not in Oldness of Letter</h2>
<p>Romans 7:6 shows that as the wife we must also serve the Lord in newness of spirit, not in oldness of letter. We have to realize that in 6:4 we have the newness of life for our living; in 7:6 we have the newness of spirit for our service. Newness of life issues from our being identified with Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and is for our walk in our daily life. Newness of spirit issues from our being discharged from the law and being joined to the resurrected Christ and is for our service to God. Thus, both newness of spirit and newness of life are results of the crucifixion of the old man.</p>
<p>Furthermore, both newness of life and newness of spirit are related to the Spirit. The newness of life is related to Christ Himself in His resurrection, who is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The spirit in the phrase <em>newness of spirit</em> refers to our regenerated human spirit, in which the Lord as the Spirit dwells (2 Tim. 4:22). We may serve in newness of spirit because God has renewed our spirit. Everything that is related to our regenerated spirit is new, and everything that comes out of our spirit is new. Our regenerated spirit is a source of newness because the Lord, the life of God, and the Holy Spirit are there. We need to learn how to exercise our spirit continually.</p>
<p>Everything in our regenerated spirit is new. In our regenerated spirit there is nothing but newness. Oldness is not with our regenerated spirit; it is with the old law, the old regulations, and the old letters. Therefore, we should not serve in oldness of letter. By <em>letter</em> here Paul means the code of the written law in the Bible. There are many ordinances, requirements, and regulations in the Bible. If we do not have the Spirit and instead desire to keep these ordinances, requirements, and regulations, we will serve God in the oldness of the dead letter. We need to realize that we, as the old man, have been crucified with Christ, and that we, as the new man, are freed from the old man&rsquo;s law and have been married to our new Husband, the resurrected Christ, that we might bear fruit to God and serve the Lord in newness of spirit.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(7)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">10. The Emancipator</h2>
<p>Romans 7:22&mdash;8:4 reveals Christ as the Emancipator who by the law of the Spirit of life delivers the wretched man from the law of sin and of death. In 7:24, Paul cries pitifully, &ldquo;Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo; The answer to Paul&rsquo;s question is presented in 7:25 and chapter 8. In particular, Paul says in 8:1-2, &ldquo;There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; Paul had no condemnation because he experienced freedom from the law of sin and of death by the law of the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>In 7:7-25 we see three laws. The first law is the law of God, which refers to the written law of God, the Ten Commandments (v. 22). The second law is the law of good in the believer&rsquo;s mind, that is, in his soul, which derives from the natural human life, that is, from man himself (v. 23). The law of good is in our good human nature created by God; it always desires to do good according to our conscience, which corresponds with the God-created human nature, enabling us to know what God justifies and what He condemns (2:14-15). The third law is the law of sin in the believer&rsquo;s members (7:23), that is, in his body, which derives from Satan, who as sin dwells in the believer&rsquo;s flesh. This law is actually sin as a natural principle. Today modern scientists try to discover the natural laws or principles related to certain things. In the same way, nearly two thousand years ago, Paul used the word <em>law</em> in the way of a scientific principle to denote an innate principle of the natural realm. Therefore, chapter 7 reveals three laws: the law of God, which refers to the Ten Commandments; the law of good, which refers to the natural man trying to do good according to his conscience; and the law of sin which makes every law-keeper a wretched man in the body of death and a captive to the law of sin.</p>
<p>Romans 8 then unveils the fourth law, the law of the Spirit of life. With the Spirit of life, there is a living law. This living law is a living person, the Triune God processed in Christ and dwelling within us. The law of the Spirit of life is the Triune God in Christ who has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and who has entered into us and become not only our life but also our law (vv. 2-3, 10-11, 34). This living person as the law of the Spirit of life frees us from the law of sin and of death in Christ Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Delivering the Captive from the Law of Sin<br />
Which Is in His Members</h2>
<p>Christ delivers the captive from the law of sin which is in his members. In 7:23 Paul says, &ldquo;I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members.&rdquo; Here the law of sin refers to the power to commit sin that arises spontaneously in man, causing man to become a slave of sin (John 8:34). Thus, man has become helpless and is controlled and manipulated by sin, doing many things against his own will. Romans 7:23 shows the warfare that occurs between the law of sin in the members of our body and the law of good in the mind of our soul. The warfare is absolutely a matter of sin in our flesh fighting against the good in our natural being; it is not at all related to our spirit or the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Moreover, the law of sin, which is in the members of man&rsquo;s fallen body, the flesh, constantly wars against and defeats the law of good in man&rsquo;s soul, thereby making man a captive. The law of God always demands that we do good. Whenever the law of God demands us to do good, the law of good in our soul responds, trying to comply with the law of God. Whenever the law of good responds to the law of God and attempts to fulfill the requirements of the law of God, the law of sin in our flesh is aroused. When the law of sin learns that the law of good is responding to the law of God, the law of sin immediately rises up to war against and defeat the law of good and invariably captures us. Thus, we become a captive to the law of sin which is in our members. This is not a doctrine; this is our life-history.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Wretched Man in the Body of Death<br />
Delivered through Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Romans 7:24 says, &ldquo;Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo; Here Paul terms our fallen body <em>the body of this death.</em> The body of sin is strong in sinning against God, but the body of this death is weak in acting to please God. Sin energizes the fallen body to sin, whereas death utterly weakens and disables the corrupted body so that it cannot keep God&rsquo;s commandments. The death in the phrase <em>the body of this death</em> is the death caused by sin through the weapon of the law, the death of being defeated, the death of trying to keep the law to please God but instead being made a captive by the law of sin in our members. This is the death that is working in our flesh.</p>
<p>In verse 25 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord!&rdquo; This verse gives the answer to the question raised in the preceding verse: Who will deliver us from the body of this death? According to verse 25, deliverance from the body of this death is through Jesus Christ our Lord. He is the Emancipator.</p>
<p>We should praise the Lord that we have One who can deliver us from the law of sin. We have God Himself who is life to us in Christ and as the Spirit, and with this life comes the most powerful law. This most powerful law, which is the law of the Spirit of life, is now operating in us.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) There Being No More Condemnation in Christ</h2>
<p>In Romans 8:1 , after his cry of wretchedness at the end of chapter 7, Paul declares in a victorious way, &ldquo;There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This means that what he experienced in Romans 7 was not an experience in Christ. Without Christ, or outside of Christ, he struggled according to the law in his mind to keep the law of God in order that he might please God, but he was totally defeated by the law of sin. This occurred when he was without Christ. Thus, Paul condemned himself. He had a deep conviction of this inward, subjective condemnation, but now &ldquo;in Christ Jesus&rdquo; there is no longer this kind of condemnation. Paul had &ldquo;no condemnation&rdquo; because in Christ he did not need to keep the law of God by himself, an effort which produced self-condemnation; &ldquo;no condemnation,&rdquo; because in Christ he had the law of the Spirit of life, which is more powerful than the law of sin and which set him free from the law of sin; &ldquo;no condemnation&rdquo; now, not because of the redeeming blood of Christ which removed the objective condemnation of God but because of the law of the Spirit of life which brought in the freedom of the Spirit in his spirit and which broke through all his subjective condemnation; and &ldquo;no condemnation,&rdquo; because he was freed from both the law of God and the law of sin.</p>
<p>The condemnation implied in 1:18 through 3:20 and mentioned in 5:16 and 18 is objective, under God&rsquo;s righteous law, and is the result of our outward sins. The condemnation mentioned in 8:1 is subjective, in our conscience, and is the result of our being inwardly defeated by the evil law of the indwelling sin, as described in 7:17-18 and 20-24. The blood of the crucified Christ is the remedy for objective condemnation (3:25). The Spirit of life mentioned in 8:2, who is Christ processed to be the life-giving Spirit and who is in our spirit, is the remedy for subjective condemnation.</p>
<p>In chapter 8 the phrase <em>in Christ</em> refers not only to our standing, our position, in Christ, as mentioned in chapter 6, but also to the reality of our daily walk in our regenerated spirit. In Christ, not in Adam or in ourselves, we have the Spirit of life&mdash;who is Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;in our spirit. In Christ our spirit has been made alive with Christ as life. Because we are in Christ, the Spirit of life who is Christ Himself dwells in our spirit and mingles Himself with our spirit as one spirit. In Christ we have our quickened spirit, the divine life, and the Spirit of life. In Christ these three&mdash;our spirit, the divine life, and the Spirit of life&mdash;are all mingled as one unit. In Christ, with this unit, there is the spontaneous power, which is the law of the Spirit of life, that continually sets us free from the law of sin and of death as we walk according to the mingled spirit.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ<br />
Having Freed Us from the Law of Sin and of Death</h2>
<p>Romans 8:2 tells us that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed us from the law of sin and of death. The Spirit and life are mentioned in this verse but only in connection with the working of this law. Life is the content and issue of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the ultimate and consummate manifestation of the Triune God after His being processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and becoming the indwelling, life-giving Spirit, who is life to all the believers in Christ. The law that has freed us from the law of sin, which is of Satan, who dwells in the members of our fallen body (7:23, 17), is of this Spirit of life. It is this law, not God or the Spirit, that works in us to deliver us from the working of the law of sin in our flesh and to enable us to know God and gain God and thereby live Him out. This law of the Spirit of life is the spontaneous power of the Spirit of life. Such a spontaneous law works automatically under the condition that fulfills its requirements.</p>
<p>Both Satan and God, after entering into our being and dwelling in us, work within us not by outward, objective activities but by an inward, subjective law. The working of the law of the Spirit of life is the working of the processed Triune God in our spirit; this is also the working of the Triune God in us in His life.</p>
<p>The major function of the processed Triune God in indwelling our spirit as the law of the Spirit of life is to free us completely from Satan, who dwells in our fallen nature as the law of sin and of death (vv. 23-25). This freeing is not only for our subjective justification but even more for our dispositional sanctification.</p>
<p>We need to see that the law of the Spirit of life freeing us from the law of sin and of death is not an experience outside of Christ but an experience absolutely in Christ. We must all remember that when we believed into Christ, we entered into Christ. Today Christ Himself is the law of the Spirit of life within us. We have been delivered from the sphere of Adam and have been transferred into the realm of Christ. In Christ there is not the law of sin and of death. In Christ there is the law of the Spirit of life, which has the capacity to operate in us daily in order to revive us and to allow us to overcome the law of sin and of death. We do not need to struggle or to strive. All we need to do is to present ourselves to the Lord and cooperate with Him, allowing the law of the Spirit of life to have an opportunity to operate within us (6:13). The way to overcome the law of sin and of death is not to make resolutions or to struggle but to call on the Lord continually and to tell Him every day, &ldquo;Lord, I love You. I want to present myself to You.&rdquo; We only need to remain in Christ, to present ourselves to Him, to give Him the freedom, and to enjoy Him. In this way, He will gain our cooperation and will operate in us spontaneously and gently as the law of the Spirit of life so that we will have peace, joy, and victory.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) God Having Condemned Sin on the Cross<br />
in the Flesh of Christ</h2>
<p>Romans 8:3 says, &ldquo;For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&rdquo; This verse reveals that God has condemned sin on the cross in the flesh of Christ. When Christ died on the cross, He also died as a man in the flesh. As the Word, which was with God and was God, He became flesh (John 1:1, 14). First Peter 3:18 says that Christ was &ldquo;put to death in the flesh.&rdquo; As a man in the flesh, Christ had only the likeness, the form, of a fallen man; He did not have the sinful nature of a fallen man. This means that He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not have the actual nature of sin. Because the Lord Jesus died as a man in the flesh, His death dealt with the fallen flesh. Sin and the fallen flesh were all dealt with by the death of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ was sent only in the likeness of the flesh of sin. He did not actually have the flesh of sin but only the form, the likeness, of the flesh of sin. This is portrayed by the type of the bronze serpent; the bronze serpent had the form of a serpent, but it did not have the poisonous nature of a serpent. Likewise, when Christ died on the cross, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not have the nature of the flesh of sin. Nevertheless, because He died as a man in the flesh, God could condemn sin in the flesh. As a man in the flesh, He died so that sin in the flesh might be condemned by God.</p>
<p>Romans 8:3 reveals that when the flesh of Christ, that is, His body, was crucified, God condemned sin which is in human flesh. That is, when Christ died as a man in the flesh, God condemned sin in the flesh. The phrase <em>sin in the flesh</em> refers to the source of sin, the devil. For this reason, in Romans 6, 7, and 8 sin is personified as living. In particular, chapter 7 reveals that sin is a person, the embodiment of Satan, and is living and acting within us. For instance, sin can work out in us coveting of every kind, deceive us, and kill us (vv. 8, 11, 17, 20). Thus, sin is an active, aggressive, living person. This living sin was condemned by God when Christ died on the cross as a man in the likeness of the flesh of sin. When the flesh that Christ put on through incarnation was crucified, God condemned the sin in the flesh of fallen mankind.</p>
<p>Although Christ did not have the sin of the flesh, He was crucified in the flesh (Col. 1:22; 1 Pet. 3:18). Thus, on the cross He judged Satan, who is related to the flesh, and the world, which hangs on him (John 12:31; 16:11), thereby destroying Satan (Heb. 2:14). At the same time, through Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man&rsquo;s flesh. As a result, it is possible for us to walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us (Rom. 8:4).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(4) That the Righteous Requirement of the Law<br />
Might Be Fulfilled in Us, Who Do Not Walk<br />
according to the Flesh, but according to the Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:4 says, &ldquo;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.&rdquo; God condemned sin in the flesh that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk according to the spirit. Because the Lord Jesus died as a man in the flesh, His death dealt with the fallen flesh. Because we have been crucified with Christ who died as a man in the flesh, we, as saved persons, are not obligated to the flesh but to God in order to live and walk according to the spirit. As long as we live, walk, and behave ourselves according to the spirit in everything, including our thinking, speaking, and actions, we are living and free.</p>
<p>When we walk according to the spirit, the righteous requirements of the law are not consciously kept by us through our outward endeavoring; rather, they are spontaneously and unconsciously fulfilled in us by the inward working of the Spirit of life. The Spirit of life is the Spirit of Christ, and Christ corresponds with the law of God. This Spirit within us spontaneously fulfills all the righteous requirements of the law through us when we walk according to Him.</p>
<p>According to Romans 8, the requirements that we must fulfill in order that the law of the Spirit of life (which has already been installed in us) may work are: (1) to walk according to the spirit (v. 4); (2) to mind the things of the Spirit&mdash;to set the mind on the spirit (vv. 5-6); (3) to put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body (v. 13); (4) to be led by the Spirit as sons of God (v. 14); (5) to cry to the Father in the spirit of sonship (v. 15); (6) to witness that we are the children of God (v. 16); and (7) to groan for the full sonship, the redemption of our body (v. 23).</p>
<p>Experiencing Christ as the law of the Spirit of life, which sets us free from the law of sin and of death, is not once for all; it must be a continuous daily experience. Day after day, moment by moment, we need to live in the mingled spirit, walk according to this spirit, and have our mind set on this wonderful spirit, forgetting our attempts of keeping the law of God and of doing good in order to please God. For once we drift back to our old, habitual way of trying to do good, we are insulated immediately from the powerful law of the Spirit of life. We should look to the Lord that we may always abide in our spirit so that we may enjoy the freedom of the law of the Spirit of life.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">11. The Spirit of Christ</h2>
<p>Romans 8:9-11 presents Christ as the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself whom we can experience and enjoy. If Christ did not become the Spirit after His death and resurrection, He could not be experienced by us. If Christ were not the Spirit, He could never enter into us. It is impossible for Christ in the flesh to enter into us; it is only as the Spirit that He can enter into us.</p>
<p>This is fully revealed in John 14. In verse 17 the Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples regarding the Spirit of reality: &ldquo;He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; In verse 18 the Lord went on to tell them, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.&rdquo; The very &ldquo;He&rdquo; who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the &ldquo;I&rdquo; who is the Lord Himself in verse 18. This means that the Christ who was in the flesh went through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ (1 Cor. 15:45). John 14:17 also reveals that the Spirit abides with and in the believers; it is by being the Spirit that the Lord enters into us and abides in us. In this verse we find the first mention of the Spirit&rsquo;s indwelling. It is fulfilled and fully developed in the Epistles (1 Cor. 6:19; Rom. 8:9-11).</p>
<p>Moreover, in John 14:28 the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, &ldquo;I am going away and I am coming to you.&rdquo; This means that He would go to the cross as a man in the flesh, that is, as the last Adam, but He would come back to the disciples as one who is transfigured, transformed, from the flesh into the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). John 20:22 indicates that when Christ in His resurrection came back to the disciples, He came to them as the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the Spirit, and breathed Himself as the Spirit into them. Apart from His being the life-giving Spirit, that is, the Spirit of Christ, it is impossible for Christ to enter into us in order to become our experience for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>We must minister the truth that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, regardless of whether Christianity accepts or opposes us on account of this truth. If Martin Luther had cared for whether the Catholic Church would accept or oppose his preaching of justification by faith, he would not have been used by God to recover that particular truth. The Lord has commissioned us with the truth that Christ is the life-giving Spirit. We can testify from our experience that apart from Christ being the Spirit we cannot enjoy Him. Conversely, when we turn to our spirit and declare that Christ is now the life-giving Spirit, we are beside ourselves with our enjoyment of Christ. The following chorus of one of our hymns speaks of our enjoyment of Christ&rsquo;s being the Spirit.</p>

<p>Today there is need of the recovery of the truth that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">a. Being the Spirit of God Who Dwells in Us<br />
That We May Be in the Spirit</h2>
<p>In Romans 8:9 Paul says, &ldquo;You are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God who dwells in us that we may be in the spirit. The Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are not two Spirits but one. Paul used these titles interchangeably, indicating that the indwelling Spirit of life in verse 2 is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of the entire Triune God. God, the Spirit, and Christ&mdash;the three of the Godhead&mdash;are all mentioned in verse 9. However, there are not three in us; there is only one, the triune Spirit of the Triune God (John 4:24; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:11). <em>The Spirit of God</em> implies that this Spirit is of the One who was from eternity past, who created the universe and is the origin of all things. <em>The Spirit of Christ</em> implies that this Spirit is the embodiment and reality of Christ, the incarnated One. This Christ accomplished everything necessary to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. He includes not only divinity, which He possessed from eternity, but also humanity, which He obtained through incarnation. He also includes human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This is the Spirit of Christ in resurrection, that is, Christ Himself dwelling in our spirit (v. 10) to impart Himself, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, into us as resurrection life and power to deal with the death that is in our nature (v. 2). Thus, we may live today in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, in Christ Himself, by living in the mingled spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Being Christ in Us to Make Our Spirit Life</h2>
<p>Romans 8:10 reveals that the Spirit of Christ is Christ in us to make our spirit life: &ldquo;If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.&rdquo; In this verse the Spirit is not mentioned, for here the emphasis is that Christ today is the Spirit and that the Spirit of Christ is the very Christ in us. According to the fact, it is Christ; according to experience, it is the Spirit. In our experience of Him, He is the Spirit; in our worshipping of Him, calling on Him, and speaking of Him, He is Christ. We receive Him as our Savior and Redeemer, but He enters into us as the Spirit. As the Redeemer, He has the title <em>Christ;</em> as the Indweller, He has the title <em>the Spirit.</em> These are not two who dwell in us but one Dweller in two aspects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ...in you&rdquo; is the crucial point of the book of Romans. In chapter 3 Christ is on the cross, shedding His blood for our redemption; in chapter 4 He is in resurrection; in chapter 6 we are in Him; now, in chapter 8 He is the Spirit in us.</p>
<p>Before we believed in the Lord, our spirit was dead. Now that we have Christ in us, our spirit is life because of righteousness. In our spirit is Christ the Spirit as righteousness, resulting in life. Moreover, we need to see that our spirit has not only been regenerated and made living; our spirit has become life. When we believed in Christ, He as the Spirit of life came into our spirit and mingled Himself with it; the two spirits thereby have become one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Now our spirit is not merely living but is life.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Being the Spirit of the One<br />
Who Raised Jesus from among the Dead<br />
Dwelling in Us to Give Life to Our Mortal Body</h2>
<p>The Spirit of Christ is also the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead, dwelling in us to give life to our mortal body. &ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you&rdquo; (Rom. 8:11). In this verse we have three matters. First, we have the entire Triune God&mdash;the One who raised Jesus from the dead, Christ Jesus, and His Spirit who indwells you. Second, we have the process required for His dispensing, as implied in the words <em>Jesus</em> (emphasizing incarnation), <em>Christ</em> (emphasizing crucifixion and resurrection), and <em>raised</em> (emphasizing resurrection). Third, we have His dispensing of Himself into the believers, as shown by the phrase <em>give life to your mortal bodies,</em> which indicates that the dispensing not only occurs at the center of our being but also reaches to the circumference, to our whole being.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>give life to your mortal bodies</em> does not refer to divine healing but to the result of our allowing the Spirit of God to make His home in us and saturate our entire being with the divine life (Eph. 3:16-19). In this way He gives His life to our mortal, dying body, not only to heal it but also that it may be enlivened to carry out His will.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Having This Spirit of Christ,<br />
That We May Be of Him</h2>
<p>Romans 8:9b says, &ldquo;Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&rdquo; This verse indicates that having the Spirit of Christ, we are of Christ. In other words, because we have the Spirit of Christ in us, we are of Christ. This shows that our being of Christ depends on His Spirit. If there were no Spirit of Christ, or if Christ were not the Spirit, there would be no way for us to be joined to Him and to belong to Him. However, Christ is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), and He is in our spirit and is one spirit with us (2 Tim. 4:22). Thus, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; This verse reveals not only that the Lord, the resurrected Christ, is the Spirit but that a believer who is joined to the Lord is also a spirit. In our organic union with Christ, what He is, we are.</p>
<p>That we are of Christ refers to the unchangeable source and position rather than to the changeable condition and experience. We have the Spirit of Christ according to the source, the new birth; hence, we are of Christ and belong to Him. In our present experience and spiritual condition, however, we need to be not only of Him but also in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">12. The Heir of God</h2>
<p>Romans 8:17 goes on to say, &ldquo;If children, heirs also; on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other, joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.&rdquo; This verse reveals that Christ is the Heir of God. It also unveils that we too are the heirs of God, for we are the joint heirs with Christ to inherit God Himself in His glory as our inheritance.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Joint Heirs with Him</h2>
<p>Christ was designated as the legal Heir to inherit all things in God&rsquo;s economy (Heb. 1:2). He, as Isaac, the son of Abraham, will inherit the earth (Psa. 2:8), the kingdom (Dan. 7:13-14), the throne (Luke 1:32), and all things (Matt. 11:27). Since He is the Heir of God, even the legal Heir of God, all that God the Father is and has is for His possession (John 16:15). Christ, the firstborn Son of God, is the appointed Heir of God, and we, the many sons of God, have been saved to be joint heirs with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Glorified with Him</h2>
<p>Romans 8:17 shows that there is a condition for us to be heirs. It is not that we are heirs simply because we are children of God. Rather, after being born as children, we must grow in life to become sons, and then we must pass through suffering that we may be glorified to become legal heirs. If we suffer with Him, we will be glorified with Him. Genuine growth in the divine life requires suffering. The more we suffer with Christ, the more we grow and the faster we are matured to be joint heirs with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">13. The Firstborn of God</h2>
<p>Romans 8:29 continues, &ldquo;Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; In this verse we see Christ as the Firstborn of God. Most Christians have heard of Christ being the only Begotten of God, but very few have heard of Christ being the Firstborn of God. Today a vast majority of Christians enjoy Christ as the only begotten Son of God, but only a few truly enjoy Christ as the firstborn Son of God. However, Romans 8 stresses that Christ is the Firstborn of God.</p>
<p>Christ was the only begotten Son of God from eternity (John 1:18). When He was sent by God into the world, He was still the only begotten Son of God (1 John 4:9; John 1:14; 3:16). By His passing through death and entering into resurrection, His humanity was uplifted into His divinity. Thus, in His divinity and with His humanity that passed through death and resurrection, He was born in resurrection as God&rsquo;s firstborn Son (Acts 13:33). At the same time, all His believers were raised together with Him in His resurrection and were begotten together with Him as the many sons of God (1 Pet. 1:3). Thus, they became His many brothers to constitute His Body and to be God&rsquo;s corporate expression in Him.</p>
<p>From eternity to eternity, Christ in His divinity is the only begotten Son of God. After He became a man with humanity in His incarnation, He, as the Son of Man, was born to be the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection. His resurrection was a great delivery in which Christ was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God, and we His believers were all born with Him to be the many sons of God (v. 3). This was the greatest corporate delivery. Because through His resurrection the disciples of Christ were regenerated with the divine life to be the many sons of God, after His resurrection He began to call them His brothers (John 20:17; Matt. 28:10). Hebrews 2:11-12 confirms this: &ldquo;For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying, &lsquo;I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.&rsquo;&rdquo; These verses indicate that after Christ resurrected from the dead, He came back to His disciples and called them brothers. He also considered them the church, indicating that the church is a corporate composition of the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>As the only begotten Son of God, Christ had divinity but not humanity; He was self-existing and ever-existing, as God is. His being the firstborn Son of God, having both divinity and humanity, began with His resurrection. With His firstborn Son as the base, pattern, element, and means, God is producing many sons, and the many sons who are produced are the many believers who believe into God&rsquo;s firstborn Son and are joined to Him as one. They are exactly like Him in life and nature, and, like Him, they have both humanity and divinity. They are His increase and expression in order that they may express the eternal Triune God for eternity. The church today is a miniature of this expression (Eph. 1:23), and the New Jerusalem in eternity will be the ultimate manifestation of this expression (Rev. 21:11).</p><h2 class="head4">a. Having Been Predestinated to Be<br />
Conformed to His Image</h2>
<p>According to Romans 8:29, we have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of Christ, the Firstborn of God. God has predestinated us not simply that we may be sanctified, spiritual, and victorious but that we may be fully conformed to the image of His Son. This is our destiny, determined by God in eternity past. Conformation is the end result of transformation. It includes the changing of our inward essence and nature, and it also includes the changing of our outward form, that we may match the glorified image of Christ, the God-man. He is the prototype, and we are the mass reproduction. Both the inward and the outward changes in us, the product, are the result of the operation of the law of the Spirit of life in our being (v. 2).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. That We May Be His Many Brothers</h2>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s foreknowledge, predestination, and calling is to prepare and produce many brothers for His firstborn Son that, on the one hand, they, together with God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, may be the many sons of God with the divine life and nature for the expression of God, and that, on the other hand, they may be the many members who constitute the Body of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son as the corporate expression of God in His firstborn Son, which is the fullness of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, that is, the fullness of God in His firstborn Son (Eph. 1:23; 3:19).</p>
<p>Many believers know that in incarnation Christ was born of Mary, the virgin, to be the Son of Man, but very few believers know that in resurrection Christ was born again to be the firstborn Son of God. It is as the firstborn Son of God that Christ is our prototype. Today we can experience and enjoy Him as our prototype, for He is the firstborn Son of God who is not only God with divinity but also a man possessing humanity. Formerly, we as men had only humanity, but when we believed into Christ and received Him, we received His divinity. Now we are the same as Christ, our unique prototype. He is the prototype, and we are His mass reproduction. He is the firstborn Son of God, and we are the many sons of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">14. The One Who Makes Us More Than Conquerors</h2>
<p>Romans 8:32-39 presents Christ as the One who makes us more than conquerors.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. God Freely Giving Us All Things with Him</h2>
<p>Romans 8:32 says, &ldquo;Indeed, He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?&rdquo; This verse shows that God freely gives us all things with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Having Died for Us, and after Being Raised,<br />
Interceding for Us at the Right Hand of God</h2>
<p>Romans 8:34 goes on to say, &ldquo;Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.&rdquo; This verse tells us that Christ died for us and that after being raised, He is interceding for us at the right hand of God. This verse states that Christ today is at the right hand of God in the heavens; verse 10, however, states that He is now in us, in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), He is omnipresent, being both at the right hand of God and in our spirit, both in heaven and on earth.</p>
<p>In Romans 8:34 it is Christ who intercedes for us, yet in verse 26 it is the Spirit who intercedes for us. These are not two Intercessors but one, the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18). He is interceding for us at two ends. At one end it is the Spirit in us, probably initiating the intercession for us; at the other end it is the Lord Christ at the right hand of God, probably completing the intercession for us, which must be mainly that we will be conformed to His image and brought into His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. No Suffering Being Able<br />
to Separate Us from His Love</h2>
<p>Romans 8:35 continues, &ldquo;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?&rdquo; No suffering including tribulation, anguish, persecution, famine, nakedness, and peril shall separate us from the love of Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">d. In All the Sufferings More than Conquering<br />
through Him Who Loved Us</h2>
<p>In Romans 8:37 Paul tells us that in all the sufferings we more than conquer through Christ who loved us. Because of God&rsquo;s unchanging love for us and the fact that Christ has accomplished everything on our behalf, neither tribulation nor persecution can suppress or defeat us; rather, in all these things we more than overcome and conquer through Him who loved us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. Nothing Being Able to Separate Us<br />
from the Love of God, Which Is in Him</h2>
<p>In Romans 8:38-39 Paul declares, &ldquo;For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; The love of God is the source of His eternal salvation. This love is in Christ and has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit (5:5). Nothing can separate us from this love of God. In God&rsquo;s salvation this love to us has become the love of Christ, which does many marvelous things for us through the grace of Christ until God&rsquo;s complete salvation is accomplished in us. These marvelous things provoke God&rsquo;s enemy to attack us with all kinds of sufferings and calamities (vv. 35-36). However, because of our response to the love of God in Christ, these attacks have become benefits to us (v. 28). Hence, we more than conquer in all our afflictions and calamities (v. 37).</p>
<p>We are God&rsquo;s beloved ones, and nothing can separate us from His love. Once God loves us, He loves us forever with an eternal, inseparable love. Therefore, God&rsquo;s salvation is secured by His love. This means that our eternal security is the love of God. We may be assured that nothing will separate us from the love of God, because this love does not derive from us or depend on us but is derived from God and depends on Him. This love was initiated by God in eternity.</p>
<p>In Romans 8:39 Paul points out that the inseparable love of God is in Christ Jesus our Lord. If the love of God were shown apart from Christ, there would be problems, for apart from Christ, even a sin such as losing our temper would separate us from the love of God. However, the love of God is not only the love of God itself but the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. Because the love of God is in Christ Jesus, we may be assured that nothing can separate us from it.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ has saved us to the extent that, on the one hand, we are in God&rsquo;s acceptance enjoying the source of this salvation, which is God&rsquo;s love in Christ, from which we cannot be separated by any person, matter, or thing; and, on the other hand, we are in God&rsquo;s life being conformed by the Lord Spirit to reach the ultimate goal of this salvation, that is, to enter into the incomparable divine glory and be glorified together with God (vv. 18, 30).</p>
<p>The first eight chapters of Romans reveal that Christ has divinity and eternal deity, and that the divine person of Christ is in the Godhead. These chapters also show that this Christ who has the Godhead became a man as the seed of David, that He passed through the processes of human living, death, and resurrection, thereby accomplishing God&rsquo;s redemption and entering into God&rsquo;s glory, and that through these processes He was eventually consummated to become the Spirit of Christ, who is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of life, and the reality, the essence, of this wonderful Christ. It is as the Spirit of Christ that He can, and does, enter into His believers to be their life, their life supply, and their everything. In summary, Christ as God was incarnated to be a man, and Christ in His humanity with flesh passed through the processes of death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit in order to be one spirit with us that we might be a part of His being as members of His wonderful Body.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(9)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">15. God Blessed Forever</h2>
<p>Romans 9:5 presents Christ as God over all, blessed forever. We need to ponder and experience this aspect of Christ so that we may enter into a rich enjoyment of Him. Christ as a God-man became the life-giving Spirit, and we as men are one spirit with Him and thus may always enjoy Him (1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17). Yet it is easy for us to neglect or even forget that Christ is nothing less than God Himself. According to Paul&rsquo;s word in Romans 9:5, the Christ into whom we believe, whom we have received, and to whom we are joined as one spirit is &ldquo;God over all, blessed forever.&rdquo; When Paul came to this point in his writing, he was so filled with the glorious person of Christ that he poured out what was in his heart and declared that Christ is God over all, blessed forever. We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that our Lord Jesus Christ is the very God who is over all and blessed forever. Though He came out of the Jewish race in the flesh, He is the infinite God. Concerning Him Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;For a child is born to us / ...His name will be called... / Mighty God.&rdquo; We praise Christ for His deity, and we worship Him as God, the complete God, blessed forever.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Out of the Fathers according to Flesh<br />
in His Humanity</h2>
<p>Christ is out of the fathers of Israel according to flesh in His humanity. Romans 9:5 says, &ldquo;Whose are the fathers, and out of whom, as regards what is according to flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.&rdquo; This verse tells us that Christ came out of the fathers. <em>The fathers</em> here refers to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and others; according to His human nature, Christ came out of the children of Israel. Christ was a man with flesh who came out of the tribe of Judah, a tribe of Israel. It is according to His humanity that Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever, could come from the fathers of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Over All in His Godhead</h2>
<p>Although in His humanity Christ came out of the fathers of Israel according to flesh, in His Godhead He is God over all, blessed forever. The Christ who is our Savior and our life is the complete God. In Romans 9:5 three matters are covered. First, Christ is God. Since Christ Himself actually is God, there is no difference between Him and God. John 1:1 says that the Word, which is Christ, was with God and was God. Jesus, a carpenter from Nazareth, was God over all and blessed forever. The only way for us to contact God and enjoy Him today is through Christ and in Christ.</p>
<p>Second, Christ is God over all; this refers to His headship which is unique and eternal. As God, Christ is over all things: man, angels, the heavens, and the earth. Christ is God who has been and will be, over all, blessed forever.</p>
<p>Some heretical teachers argue that there are different ranks within the Godhead and that Jesus Christ as God occupies a lower rank in the Godhead. They contend that according to Psalm 82:6, angels are gods. They say that this means that the angels are gods on a lower level in the Godhead, and that like the angels, Jesus Christ as God occupies a lower rank in the Godhead. However, according to Romans 9:5, Jesus Christ is God over all, blessed forever. Certainly, this cannot be said of the angels, for they are neither over all nor blessed forever. Jesus Christ is God over all, including the angels.</p>
<p>Third, Christ is not only God over all but also God blessed forever. In the universe only God Himself is worthy of being blessed. As God, Christ is blessed forever, that is, eternally. Christ is God over all, blessed for eternity. No one can deny the truth that although Christ was incarnated to be a man, Christ is God Himself over all, blessed forever.</p>
<p>It is a shame that certain so-called Christians argue about the deity of Christ and debate whether or not Christ is God. In Christian history there have been so-called Christian teachers who deny the deity of Christ. For instance, modernists do not believe in the deity of Christ, thereby denying His Godhead. Twisting the Holy Scriptures, some believe that although Christ was a perfectly good man, He was not the complete God. They deny the deity of Christ and do not enjoy His headship because they do not realize that the trinity of the Godhead is not merely for people to understand as theological knowledge but for the Triune God to dispense Himself into us for our enjoyment. Conversely, if we see that the trinity of the Godhead is not mainly for theological understanding but for the divine dispensing, we will never doubt that Christ is God. We must hold the truth that Christ is God.</p>
<p>Christ is not only God but also the embodiment of God. God is mysterious, abstract, and invisible, yet He is embodied in Christ. Whatever God is, has, has done, has obtained, has attained, is doing, will do, will obtain, and will attain are all embodied in Christ. In Christ we see creation, incarnation, redemption, resurrection, ascension, and the dispensing of the Triune God into us for our enjoyment. It is in Christ that we can enjoy the Triune God through His divine dispensing. If we see this revelation, we cannot deny the deity of Christ. If we deny the deity of Christ, we deny the entirety of God&rsquo;s divine economy.</p>
<p>In keeping with this thought, the apostle John in 1 John 2:22 says, &ldquo;Who is the liar if not he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.&rdquo; To deny that Jesus is the Christ is the heresy of Cerinthus, a first century Syrian heresiarch of Jewish descent educated at Alexandria. His heresy was a mixture of Judaism, Gnosticism, and Christianity. He separated the maker (creator) of the world from God and represented that maker as a subordinate power. He taught adoptionism, saying that Jesus was merely God&rsquo;s adopted Son and had become the Son of God by being exalted to a status that was not His by birth; thus, he denied that Jesus had been conceived by the Holy Spirit. In his heresy he separated the earthly man Jesus, regarded as the son of Joseph and Mary, from the heavenly Christ and taught that after Jesus was baptized, Christ as a dove descended upon Him, and then He announced the unknown Father and did miracles. Further, he taught that at the end of His ministry Christ departed from Jesus, and Jesus suffered death on the cross and rose from the dead, while Christ remained separate as a spiritual being, and, finally, that Christ will rejoin the man Jesus at the coming of the Messianic kingdom of glory.</p>
<p>To confess that Jesus is the Christ is to confess that He is the Son of God (Matt. 16:16; John 20:31). Hence, to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Father and the Son. Whoever so denies the divine person of Christ is an antichrist.</p>
<p>In 1 John 2:23 John goes on to say, &ldquo;Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.&rdquo; Since the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30; Isa. 9:6), to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father. Here to deny the Son is to deny the deity of Christ, to deny that the man Jesus is God. This is a great heresy.</p>
<p>In 1 John 2:24, John continues, &ldquo;As for you, that which you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If that which you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.&rdquo; In this verse, <em>that which you heard from the beginning</em> is the Word of life, that is, the Word of the eternal life that the believers heard from the beginning (1:1-2). Not to deny but to confess that the man Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God (2:22), is to let the Word of the eternal life abide in us. In so doing we abide in the Son and in the Father and are not led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ&rsquo;s person (v. 26). This indicates that the Son and the Father are the eternal life for our regeneration and enjoyment. In this eternal life we have fellowship with God and with one another (1:2-3, 6-7) and have our being in our daily walk (2:6; 1:7).</p>
<p>In summary, 1 John 2:22-24 reveals that if you deny that the man Jesus is Christ as God, you will have neither the Father nor the Son. Consequently, you will not have eternal life, which is in the Son (5:11-12), and you will not have any experience and enjoyment of Christ. If you deny Christ&rsquo;s deity, you will have no way to experience and enjoy Him.</p>
<p>The reason many heretical teachers deny the deity of Christ is that they have never enjoyed Christ. But we who have experienced and enjoyed Christ cannot deny His deity. We know that Christ is God, not by mere theological doctrines but by our personal experience. Since we have experienced Christ as God, we know Him as our Redeemer (Gal. 3:13); we know that His death is all-inclusive and eternally effective (Heb. 9:14); we know that as the infinite God mingled with a genuine man, He died for all men, especially for all His believers (1 Tim. 2:6; 2 Cor. 5:14-15); and we know that He is God over all, blessed forever (Rom. 9:5). Because we have experienced and enjoyed Christ, we can and must testify of our rich enjoyment of Christ as the mighty God who is our righteousness, our holiness, our meekness, our wisdom, our way, and our everything.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(10)</h1>
<p>In this message we will cover three more aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in Romans 10.</p>
<h2 class="head3">16. Christ, the Word, and the Lord</h2>
<p>In Romans 10:4-13, Christ is presented as Christ, the Word, and the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.Christ</h2>
<p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes.&rdquo; This verse indicates that Christ came to be the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The End of the Law</h2>
<p>Christ is the end of the law. As such, He fulfilled the law, completed the law, and replaced the law, thereby ending the law (Matt. 5:17). When He died on the cross, Christ completed and terminated the law. The law ended in Him. Since the law was terminated on the cross of Christ, we should no longer be under it.</p>
<p>The Jews treasured the law and tried to keep it that they might establish their own righteousness before God. They did not see that the law had been fully completed and terminated by Christ. If they had seen this, they would have stopped their attempts to keep the law. They would never again have tried to establish their own righteousness before God.</p>
<p>The principle is the same with many Christians today. After being saved, they make up their minds to do good to please God. As a result, they spontaneously make regulations for themselves, regulations which may be considered self-made laws, and they endeavor to fulfill them in an attempt to be pleasing to God. Like the Jews, they do not see that Christ is the end, the termination, of all regulations and that they should take Him as their life that they may live righteously before God.</p>
<p>If we desire to experience Christ, we must realize that most of us are under certain laws, including our self-made laws. We need to see that when Christ visits us, He comes to us as the end of our self-made laws. When He grants us a gracious visitation, we will be stopped from trying to keep our self-made laws. His visitation will stop all our activities as well as all our desires, intentions, and even schedules made by ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Unto Righteousness to Everyone Who Believes</h2>
<p>Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness. The termination of the law is unto, or results in, righteousness to everyone who believes in Him. This means that the result of Christ terminating the law is that God&rsquo;s righteousness is given to everyone who believes in Christ. He replaced the law that we may believe in Him to have Him as our righteousness. We need to see that the only genuine righteousness before God is Christ, the One who has terminated the law that He might be the living righteousness to everyone who believes in Him. Everyone who believes in Him receives God&rsquo;s righteousness, which is Christ Himself. He is the end of the law so that we may gain and enjoy Him as our real and living righteousness before God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Word</h2>
<p>Romans 10:5-8 reveals Christ as the word: &ldquo;For Moses writes concerning the righteousness which is out of the law: &lsquo;The man who does them shall live by them.&rsquo; But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, &lsquo;Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ down; or, &lsquo;Who will descend into the abyss?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ up from the dead. But what does it say? &lsquo;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,&rsquo; that is, the word of the faith which we proclaim.&rdquo; In these verses, <em>the word</em> is used interchangeably with <em>Christ,</em> indicating that this word is Christ. Christ was incarnated by coming down from heaven and was resurrected by coming up from Hades. Thus, He has become the living Word, the Spirit (Eph. 6:17), to be in our mouth and in our heart, just like the air, the breath, that can be taken into our being. He is near and He is available.</p><h2 class="head5">(1) Having Descended from Heaven<br />
to Mingle Himself with Humanity<br />
for the Accomplishment of Redemption</h2>
<p>Christ as the Word descended from heaven to mingle Himself with humanity for the accomplishment of redemption. Surely, the Word here is Christ personified. If the Word were not a living person, He could not have descended from heaven to mingle Himself with humanity for the accomplishment of redemption. Paul quotes Deuteronomy 30:12, saying, &ldquo;Do not say in your hearts, Who will ascend into heaven?&rdquo; He then points out that this means &ldquo;to bring Christ down&rdquo; and that this refers to Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, for Christ came down from the heavens in His incarnation.</p>
<p>In His incarnation, Christ as the Word brought the infinite God into the finite man, thereby mingling the Triune God with the tripartite man, that is, divinity with humanity (Matt. 1:20). He mingled Himself with humanity in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s redemption (John 1:1, 14, 29). After passing through His human living, Christ went to die on the cross as a God-man to redeem us back to God (1 Pet. 3:18).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Having Ascended from the Dead for Justification<br />
unto Life to Those Who Receive Him by Believing</h2>
<p>Christ as the Word ascended from the dead for justification unto life to those who receive Him by believing. After His death Christ as the Word descended into the abyss, Hades, and He ascended from that place in His resurrection so that those who receive Him by believing in Him may be justified by God and have His life. We need to see that the Word descended from the heavens and ascended into heaven. Paul says that we should not ask, &ldquo;Who will descend into the abyss?&rdquo; To &ldquo;descend into the abyss&rdquo; means to bring Christ up from the dead and refers to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. To descend into the abyss means to die and to enter into Hades. When Christ died, He descended into the abyss, and in resurrection He was brought up from the dead, that is, out of the abyss. Christ is the One who has passed through incarnation and resurrection. Therefore, we may say that He as the Word is the &ldquo;processed&rdquo; Christ, Christ incarnated and resurrected.</p>
<p>Christ as the Word has passed through a long process from incarnation through resurrection. In this process He accomplished everything that is required by God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory and all that is needed to enable us to partake of Him. He was God incarnated to be a man, and as a man, He was transfigured through resurrection into the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Now in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, He is so available that we may receive Him and take Him in at any time and in any place. As the life-giving Spirit, He is now moving on earth, ready for and available to anyone who will receive Him. Whoever receives Him by believing into Him will be justified by God and receive His life. According to Paul, this processed Christ, Christ incarnated and resurrected, is &ldquo;the word of the faith which we proclaim&rdquo; (Rom. 10:8).</p>
<h2 class="head5">(3) Being the Living Word in Our Mouth and in Our Heart</h2>
<p>Christ as the living Word is not only in our mouth but also in our heart. This indicates that the word must be in the Spirit. Otherwise, the word may be in our mouth, but it cannot be in our heart. Christ in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit is the living Word. This corresponds with the New Testament revelation that the Word is the Spirit (Eph. 6:17). Christ in resurrection is both the Spirit and the Word. He is the Spirit for us to touch, and He is the Word for us to understand. We may receive Him as both the Spirit and the Word. The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the living Word that is so near to us. He is in our mouth and in our heart. Our mouth is for calling, and our heart is for believing. Thus, we can call upon Him with our mouth and believe in Him with our heart. When we call on Him, we are saved; when we believe in Him, we are justified.</p>
<p>The word, which is personified, is not only in our mouth but also in our heart. The word is not merely the written word but also the living Word, that is, the person of Christ Himself. This word is actually the gospel (1:13; Col. 1:5). When we hear the word, we hear the gospel; when we receive the word, we receive the gospel and Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Lord</h2>
<p>Romans 10:9-13 reveals that Christ is the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(1) The Same Lord of All</h2>
<p>Verse 12 says, &ldquo;For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; Christ is the same Lord of all (Acts 10:36; 1 Cor. 8:6). Here <em>all</em> refers to all persons including the Jews and the Gentiles. Christ is the Lord of all peoples, that is, He is the Lord of all races, tribes, and nationalities (Rev. 5:9).</p>
<p>Acts 13:1 confirms that Christ is the same Lord of all: &ldquo;Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.&rdquo; In this verse we see that different peoples had become one church. The prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch were from a number of different sources. Barnabas was a Levite, a Cyprian by birth (4:36). Niger, whose name means black and should denote a Negro, was probably of African origin. Lucius the Cyrenian was from Cyrene in North Africa. He may have been a Jew if he was the Lucius in Romans 16:21, who was Paul&rsquo;s kinsman. Manaen was the foster brother of Herod and was governmentally related to the Romans. Hence, Manaen must have been Europeanized. Finally, Acts 13:1 mentions Saul, a Jew born in Tarsus and taught by Gamaliel according to the law of Moses (22:3). The five prophets and teachers recorded here were composed of Jewish and Gentile peoples with different backgrounds, education, and status. This indicates that the church is composed of all races and classes of believers regardless of their background. The church is not the church of any particular race; rather, it is the church of the believers from different races who have been redeemed and regenerated and are being transformed to be glorified (1 Thes. 1:1). Although every race considers itself to be superior to other races and thus looks down on others, Christ is the same Lord of all and the church is composed of all races and classes of people.</p>
<h2 class="head5">(2) Being Rich to All Who Call Upon Him</h2>
<p>Christ is rich to <em>all</em> who call upon Him (Rom. 10:12b), irrespective of nationality, wealth, behavior, culture, or education. Moreover, that Christ is <em>rich</em> to those who call upon Him reveals that God selects us, redeems us, justifies us, sanctifies us, conforms us, and glorifies us in Christ in order that we may enjoy His unsearchable riches in Christ (Eph. 3:8). The secret to this enjoyment is to call on His name. If we open our mouth wide and call on the Lord, the riches of His divinity will be our portion (Psa. 81:10).</p>
<p>Christ needs our participation in Him. Since we have been made vessels to contain Him, we need to believe with our heart to receive Him and to call on Him continually with our mouth to take Him in, thus allowing His riches to fill our empty vessel (Rom. 9:21-23).</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that calling on the Lord is the way to partake of and enjoy the Lord. Deuteronomy 4:7 says that the Lord is near &ldquo;whenever we call upon Him.&rdquo; Psalm 145:18 says that the Lord is &ldquo;near to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; Psalm 18:6 and 118:5 say that David called upon the Lord in his distress. In Psalm 50:15 the Lord asks us to call upon Him in the day of trouble, and in Psalm 86:7 David did it accordingly. Psalm 81:7 says that the children of Israel did the same thing (Exo. 2:23) and that the Lord told them, &ldquo;Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it&rdquo; (Psa. 81:10). Psalm 86:5 says that the Lord is good, ready to forgive, and is abundant in lovingkindness to all that call upon Him. Psalm 116:3-4 says, &ldquo;The bonds of death encompassed me, / And the distresses of Sheol fell upon me; / I fell upon trouble and sorrow. / But I called upon the name of Jehovah.&rdquo; Verse 13 of the same psalm says, &ldquo;I will take up the cup of salvation / And call upon the name of Jehovah.&rdquo; In order to take the cup of salvation, that is, to participate in and enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, we need to call upon the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Lamentations 3:55-57 makes it clear that when we call upon the Lord He draws near to us and that our calling upon Him is our breathing, our cry. By this we can realize that to call upon the Lord is not only to cry to Him but also to experience spiritual breathing (Exo. 2:23) in which we breathe out all that is within us, whether it be agony, pain, pressure, etc. Jeremiah did this when he called upon the Lord out of a low dungeon, that is, out of the lowest pit. Whenever we are in a spiritual dungeon or pit, under a certain suppression, we can call on the Lord, breathing out the heaviness within us, and thus be delivered from the lowest pit. This kind of calling on the Lord not only enables us to breathe out the negative things from within us but also to breathe in the Lord Himself with all His riches as our strength, enjoyment, comfort, and rest. In this way we partake of the riches of the Lord. Hence, in Romans 10:12 Paul tells us that the Lord is &ldquo;rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; Today in resurrection the Lord is ready and available for our participation in Him, and He is rich for our enjoyment of Him. We simply need to call on Him all the time. Calling on Him, we partake of and enjoy all His riches.</p>
<p>Calling on the Lord is different from merely praying to Him. The Greek word for <em>call on</em> or <em>call upon</em> means to invoke a person, to call a person by name. Although it is possible to pray to the Lord silently, calling on the Lord requires that we cry out to Him or address Him audibly. The Hebrew word for <em>call</em> in Genesis 4:26 means to &ldquo;call out to&rdquo; or &ldquo;cry unto.&rdquo; Isaiah 12:4 and 6 show that to call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name is to &ldquo;cry out and give a ringing shout.&rdquo; Lamentations 3:55 and 56 reveal the same thing&mdash;to call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name is to &ldquo;cry&rdquo; to the Lord. To call upon the Lord is to cry to Him.</p>
<p>According to the Scriptures, this matter of calling on the name of the Lord began with the third generation of mankind. From the time of Enosh, &ldquo;men began to call upon the name of Jehovah&rdquo; (Gen. 4:26). Then Abraham (12:8), Isaac (26:25), Job (Job 12:4), Moses (Deut. 4:7), Jabez (1 Chron. 4:10), Samson (Judg. 16:28), Samuel (1 Sam. 12:18), David (2 Sam. 22:4; 1 Chron. 21:26), Jonah (Jonah 1:6), Elijah (1 Kings 18:24), Elisha (2 Kings 5:11), and Jeremiah (Lam. 3:55) all practiced this matter of calling on the name of the Lord. Moreover, in Joel 2:32, Zephaniah 3:9, and Zechariah 13:9 it is prophesied that people will call on the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost the New Testament believers also called on the name of the Lord to receive the outpoured Spirit as the fulfillment of Joel&rsquo;s prophecy (Acts 2:17-21). God poured out His Spirit, and the believers opened their mouths to receive the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord. The Spirit has been poured out by God, but we need to receive Him. The way to receive Him is to open our mouths and call on the Lord. Hence, the New Testament believers, like Stephen (7:59), practiced this. By calling on the Lord they made it known that they were followers of the Lord (9:14). When Paul was Saul, the persecutor of the church, he intended to arrest the believers, recognizing them by their calling on the name of the Lord. After he was converted, he was advised to wash away his sins, mainly referring to his persecution of those who called on the Lord, by calling on the name of the Lord himself (22:16). Undoubtedly, this practice was common among the early saints.</p>
<p>In addressing his first Epistle to the church at Corinth, Paul said, &ldquo;All those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:2). This indicates that all the early believers practiced this matter of calling. In his second Epistle to Timothy, Paul charged him to pursue spiritual things &ldquo;with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&rdquo; (2:22). Therefore, we must also practice it. The Old Testament saints called on the Lord daily (Psa. 88:9) and throughout their entire life (116:2). We should practice calling on the Lord &ldquo;out of a pure heart&rdquo; (2 Tim. 2:22) and with &ldquo;a pure language&rdquo; (Zeph. 3:9). If we practice this, we will certainly partake of the Lord&rsquo;s riches and enjoy them. To call on the Lord is not only for salvation but also for the enjoyment of the Lord with all His riches.</p><h2 class="head5">(3) Whoever Calls upon His Name Being Saved</h2>
<p>Romans 10:9-10 says, &ldquo;That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation.&rdquo; These verses show two steps of our being justified and saved: believing in the heart that God has raised Him from the dead and confessing Him with the mouth. The former is inward, and the latter is outward. To believe with the heart is toward God; to confess with the mouth is toward man. To believe with the heart is to believe in Christ, who was glorified and raised by God from the dead; to confess with the mouth is to confess that Jesus, who was despised and rejected by man, is Lord. Both are conditions for our being justified and saved.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(a) Believing in His Heart That God Has Raised Christ<br />
from the Dead unto Righteousness</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being raised from the dead was invisible; hence, it requires our believing. Moreover, although Christ&rsquo;s death has redeemed us, it is His life in resurrection alone that can save us. Therefore, only when we believe in the great miracle that God performed in Him in raising Him from the dead, can we be both redeemed and saved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Paul says that with the heart &ldquo;there is believing unto righteousness&rdquo; (v. 10). <em>Unto</em> is an equivalent of a Greek preposition which, in many instances, means &ldquo;resulting in.&rdquo; Therefore, the result of believing with the heart is righteousness. If you want to be justified, that is, to have the righteousness of God, you must believe in the Lord Jesus. If you believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus from the dead, you will be justified. Believing in this way is unto, or results in, righteousness. When you believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus from the dead, your believing results in receiving righteousness. Receiving righteousness equals being justified by God.</p>
<h2 class="head6">(b) Confessing Him with His Mouth unto Salvation</h2>
<p>Although believing in your heart results in righteousness, in order to complete the step in salvation, you must confess with your mouth. Paul says, &ldquo;With the mouth there is confession unto salvation&rdquo; (v. 10). The result of confessing with the mouth is salvation. If you want to be saved, you need to confess the Lord Jesus. Certainly, to confess with your mouth is to call on the name of the Lord, that is, to say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; When you call on the name of the Lord, the entire universe, including the angels, demons, men, and all created things, realizes that you are saved. You need to call on the name of the Lord audibly, even loudly. Therefore, when you preach the gospel, you must not only help sinners to believe in the Lord but also teach them to call on the name of the Lord loudly.</p>
<p>When we call on the name of the Lord from deep within our spirit, whether loudly, softly, or even silently, we will be beside ourselves with joy and will be brought into ecstasy. Our enjoyment of Christ by calling on His name with the exercise of our spirit is strong proof that God is now the Spirit, that our Lord Jesus Christ is also the Spirit, and that we have our regenerated spirit.</p>
<p>Of all the chapters in the book of Romans, chapter 10 presents the most concerning Christ. In verse 4 Christ is called &ldquo;the end of the law.&rdquo; In no other chapter in the whole New Testament is Christ designated in such a way. Hence, Romans 10 gives us a very crucial title of Christ: <em>the end of the law.</em> This Christ was incarnated by coming down from heaven and was resurrected by coming up from the abyss. Having passed through this process, Christ, who is the end of the law, has become the living word. He is near us, even in our mouth and in our heart. The two phrases <em>in your mouth</em> and <em>in your heart</em> imply that Christ is like the air (v. 8). Only air can be in our mouth and in our heart. The resurrected Christ is the living word, which is the Spirit; He is like the air, the breath, that we take into our being. All we need to do is exercise our mouth to breathe Him in, our heart to receive Him, and our spirit to retain Him. If we do this, we will be saved and supplied with all His riches by calling on His name.</p>
<p>Romans 10 presents an excellent description and definition of Christ for our participation. We must not only believe in Him with our heart but also call on Him with our mouth. We must call on Him, not only for salvation but also for the enjoyment of His riches. We were made vessels to contain Him; we were selected and predestinated to be His containers. This requires our cooperation in receiving Him and taking Him in. In order to do this we need to open ourselves from the depths of our being and call upon Him with our mouth from deep within our spirit so that our human vessels would be filled with Christ.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(11)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">17. The Deliverer</h2>
<p>Christ is the Deliverer. Romans 11:26 says, &ldquo;Thus all Israel will be saved, as it is written, &lsquo;The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.&rsquo;&rdquo; Today the Israelites do not believe in the Lord Jesus and do not accept Him as their Messiah and Savior, yet according to this verse, one day Christ will come back as their Deliverer. He will come out of Zion in heaven and will turn away ungodliness from Jacob. At that time, all the remaining Israelites will be saved; they will receive Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him as their Savior.</p>
<h2 class="head3">18. The Element and the Sphere<br />
of the Members in the Body</h2>
<p>Romans 12:5 indicates that Christ is the element and the sphere of the members in the Body: &ldquo;So we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.&rdquo; In the Body of Christ, Christ Himself is the element and sphere of all the members because it is in Christ that we are members one of another.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.In Him the Many Believers Being One Body</h2>
<p>We are one Body in Christ, having an organic union with Him. The phrase <em>in Christ</em> always implies that we are organically united with Christ. This union makes us one in life with Him and with all the other members of His Body. The Body is not an organization or a society but is altogether an organism produced by the union in life that we have with Christ.</p>
<p>Romans 12 speaks of the Body from the angle of the organic union, that is, from that of the uniting life, a life that unites us together, not only with Christ but with all the other members of Christ. Formerly, we had been born in Adam, but God took us out of Adam and transplanted us into Christ by rebirth. It is rebirth, or regeneration, that has brought us into an organic union with Christ, thus making us a part of Christ. To be organic in the Body means that we must be organically united with Christ and thereby planted into His Body. Then we will have an organic union with the Body of Christ and become a part of the Body.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is altogether a matter of life and a matter of remaining in our organic union with Christ. When we remain in this organic union, we are in the Body. When we do not remain in this organic union, we are practically and experientially out of the Body. The actuality of the Body is to remain in this organic union with Christ. In order to actually live in the Body life, we must remain in the organic union with Christ. This is simply to remain in Christ. In John 15 the Lord Jesus tells us that He is the vine, we are the branches, and we should abide in Him (vv. 4-5). To abide in Him means to remain in an organic union with Him. When we remain in this organic union with Christ, we are actually living in the Body. But if we do not remain in this organic union, for all practical purposes we have left the Body. For instance, when we speak by ourselves and apart from Christ, we have left the Body. Our gossip, our free talk, and our loose conversation are all signs that we have left the Body.</p>
<p>The Body is not merely a group of Christians coming together. The Body is something that is held together in the organic union with Christ. The Body is altogether a matter in the organic union with Christ. In order to realize the Body of Christ, we need to fully experience the organic union with Christ with a thorough realization that we are organically one with Christ in life. If we do not realize the organic union in Christ, in practicality we are outside of the Body and apart from the Body.</p><h2 class="head4">b. In Him the Believers Being<br />
Severally Members One of Another</h2>
<p>In ourselves we are not the members of the Body of Christ. If we are in ourselves, in practicality we are not the members of the Body. We are members one of another in Christ&mdash;not in ourselves&mdash;for Christ is both the element which makes us members one of another and the sphere in which we are members one of another. Hence, we should learn to enjoy Christ as the element and sphere of the members in the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head3">19. The Lord of the Dead and of the Living</h2>
<p>In Romans 14:9 Christ is presented as the Lord of the dead and of the living: &ldquo;For Christ died and lived again for this, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.&rdquo; In keeping with this, Paul declares, &ldquo;For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself; for whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore whether we live or we die, we are the Lord&rsquo;s&rdquo; (vv. 7-8).</p>
<h2 class="head3">20. The Receiver of All Believers</h2>
<p>In Romans 15:7-12, Christ is revealed as the Receiver of all the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Receiving All the Believers to the Glory of God</h2>
<p>Romans 15:7 says, &ldquo;Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received you to the glory of God.&rdquo; Verse 3 of chapter 14 says that we should receive people according to God&rsquo;s receiving, but here we are told that we should receive people according to Christ&rsquo;s receiving. Christ&rsquo;s receiving is God&rsquo;s receiving. What Christ has received, God has received. Those whom God and Christ have received we must receive, regardless of how they differ from us in doctrine or practice. This will be to the glory of God.</p>
<p>Christ receives all the believers, regardless of how different they are from one another in their doctrines and practices, as long as they believe the New Testament gospel and receive Him according to the New Testament economy. We need to learn to receive all the believers as Christ does. If a person believes that Jesus is the Son of God incarnated to be a man, that He died on the cross for our sins, that He was resurrected physically and spiritually, and that He is now at the right hand of God, then we must receive him.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s receiving is in accordance with our faith in Him. Whoever believes in Him, He will receive; whoever receives Him, He will never reject. Thus, in John 6:37 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out.&rdquo; Since coming to Him, believing in Him, and receiving Him are the only conditions for Christ&rsquo;s receiving, we must receive the believers upon the same basis without any additional requirement. As long as anyone believes in Christ and receives Him as his personal Savior, we have no choice but to receive him, for the Lord has received him.</p>
<p>Romans 15:12 continues, &ldquo;Again, Isaiah says, &lsquo;There shall be the root of Jesse, even He who rises to rule the Gentiles; on Him will the Gentiles hope.&rsquo;&rdquo; Although Christ is the root of Jesse, who was David&rsquo;s father and who signifies the Jewish people, He will also be the Ruler of the Gentiles. Here we see the all-inclusiveness of Christ. He is the root of Jesse, meaning that He is the supply for the Jewish people. According to Romans 11, His being the root means that He is the source and supply for the Jews. In the future this root of Jesse will rise to rule over all the Gentile nations. Thus, He supplies the Jews and overshadows the nations. By being the root to the Jewish people and by being the overshadowing One, the Ruler, over the nations, He brings together the Jews and the nations and makes them one. Christ embraces both the Jews and the Gentiles and brings them together for one Body, for one new man, the church. Christ is all-inclusive and all-embracing. Since Christ is such an all-embracing One, bringing together the Jews and the Gentiles, we must receive all the different believers according to this Christ. We should never say that we cannot accept so many different people. Rather, we should consider Christ who is the root of one people and is the Ruler, the overshadowing One, over another people. He is all-inclusive. In receiving the saints, we must likewise be all-embracing, receiving people from every place, race, and nationality. Whoever they are and whatever they are, we must embrace all believers together in one Body. This is what it means to receive the saints according to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. In Him Even the Nations Will Hope</h2>
<p>Verse 12 shows that the Gentiles will hope on Christ. This means that the Gentiles will have hope in Christ, that is, put their trust in Him. According to Ephesians 2:12, since the Gentiles were apart from Christ, were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and were strangers to the covenants of God&rsquo;s promise, they had no hope whatsoever. Yet now in Christ they can have hope and put their trust. Regardless of their races, nationalities, and occupations, the unbelieving Gentiles, both in the ancient and modern times, have no hope whatsoever. However, although the Gentile believers may come from different races and nationalities, they all have the same hope in the same Lord. Today we, as the believers, should enjoy Christ as the object of all our hopes.</p></body></html>
