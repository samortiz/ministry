Not only did a great number of new ones attend the meeting, but the way they entered the meeting hall was also orderly
From the new believers' testimonies we see that the result of preaching the gospel through door-knocking is unlimited
Some testified that they were considering to become Christians but did not know how, and they were hoping that someone would visit them
On the one hand the Lord wanted Peter to go while on the other hand the Lord had already done all the preparation work in Corneliuss house
In this short passage on the one hand the Lord likened Gods chosen people to sheep while on the other hand He likened them to His harvest
In both the Gospels of Luke and of Matthew the Lord said that He sent forth His disciples as lambs in the midst of wolves
If we rely only on putting out newspaper advertisements and making telephone calls, we may never be able to find them
If we go out knocking on doors from house to house, there will be many sheep, the sons of peace, waiting for us
For the past two thousand years, Christianity has indeed tried to do something on the earth according to the Bible
The Lord Jesus told us in Matthew 13 that the seeds were sown here and there, but in the end, tares grew in the midst of the wheat
We have to believe that among those who are baptized, the number of the false ones will be far less than the real ones
In simple words, those who attend the meetings regularly are not well prepared, so the meetings do not have the adequate supply and riches
Rather, we are referring to a meeting that has weighty prayers, prayers with light, life, truth, experience, and supply
Mere stirring up and singing with shouting in the meetings are not the proper worship to God or remembrance of the Lord
Prayer includes praise, and reading the Word of God includes prayer; these four items are the elements of the contents of a meeting
If there is still no turning, a brother should add another prayer, and if necessary, another brother should add more
In the practice of the home meetings, we should have a three-minute speaking before the meeting and a five-minute speaking after the meeting
Our spirit should be released, and our voice must be uplifted, but we should not shout aloud for the purpose of having fun
We are not watching a ball game in the meeting; we are gathered around the Lord to worship, praise, and remember Him
We should be rejoicing before the Lord, as David leapt joyfully before the Lord , but we should never be playful
On one hand, we minister the truth and supply life so that people can see a fresh and living situation when they come to the meeting
On the other hand, we should make people feel respectful, sensing that God is here, because we are before God and before the Lord
Never despise the newly saved ones, because every man created by God has within him a desire, a feeling, to worship God
When people come to the meetings, they are not attending a school party or going to a nightclub or a ball game
On the day of Pentecost, after the crowd heard the gospel preached by Peter, they asked Peter, 'What should we do'?
We need to learn how to lead people to repent, how to help them to care for their conscience, and how to cause them to have an inner sense
When the Spirit comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment
Although since Brother Nee's time, we have tried hard to do well in this matter, this has not been worked out until now
If in a meeting of two thousand people, hardly one word of life can be heard throughout the meeting, this is not right
Although today is the age of grace, as long as people contact and meet the Lord, they will prostrate before Him
Although the way we are taking is the right one it is very difficult to succeed completely in this last step of practicing the home meetings
We have to experiment with the home meetings personally, attending them to see how they are conducted and carried out
We all help people to read the Bible but while others do it in a living and enlightening way we may do it in a dead rigid and darkening way
We need to be continuously enriched with life truth light and experience and exercise continuously with our methods until we are skillful
On the one hand there is a desire within man but on the other hand many are not willing to pay the price to practically achieve this desire
If a person is sent to live on a mountain, even though he had his whole family there, he would still feel lonely and lacking
Years ago there was a certain Christian youth association which laid emphasis on three aspects of education moral intellectual and physical
When a Christian is saved, the new life within him enriches the human life that originally was created according to God's image
After we are saved, we are delivered not only from sin but even more from the improper condition of our human nature
There are love and affection in human nature, but if they are exercised in an inappropriate, improper way, they become sinful
As human beings, we have the need for love and gathering together, but love and gathering together must be put in the right place
Considering the crimes in society as a whole, we can see that most of them come out of these two needs-love and gathering together
For the sake of meeting the need of man's fallen, slothful, and loose character, fallen Christianity has invented big meetings
In addition, they have trained many pastors and preachers for the purpose of delivering messages to the gathered congregation
The entertaining speaking, the musical accompaniment, and the singing of hymns are a big attraction in Christianity
For this reason, many people liked to go to the chapel on the Lord's Day morning and to the football field in the afternoon
That was the kind of meeting in Christianity that suited man's slothful and loose character as well as his need for gathering together
Many who have come to the Lord's recovery still have the desire to have a Sunday service, although they do not say it as such
Even so, a sister may still make a deal with her husband that she cooks for only six days and has one day off; otherwise, she will quit
Everyone likes to come to the meetings with the thought that others will prepare everything, and they simply can come to enjoy
If the home meetings are not properly handled, the Lord's recovery will be over, and there will certainly be no way for us to go on
If the home meetings are successful, people will remain, but if the home meetings are not successful, everything will be a failure
When we first came to Taiwan, we cared very much for small group meetings and not as much for the big meetings
After working for more than thirty years, the small group meetings are nearly gone, while the big meetings are all the more flourishing
Today whether the Lord's recovery can spread, flourish, or even survive depends on whether we succeed in the home meetings
Brother Watchman Nee raised a cry again and again that we should have a meeting that is the same as the one described in 1 Corinthians 14:26
It should not be one person speaking while all the others listen, but 'each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation'
We have seen clearly that if the small meetings are flourishing, the Lord's recovery will also become flourishing
The main reason for their failures was that most of them preferred to have big meetings and to have well-known people give messages
When it is time for a home meeting, he has to dress himself neatly, tidy up his house, and wait for the saints to come for the meeting
In order to deal with difficult situations in the home meeting, we first need to be respectable persons, persons highly regarded by others
Even before we speak, by our expression, appearance, and posture, people may realize that we are persons with weight
When people look at us, whether in our speaking or conduct, they will not find us light because there is weight within us
If you young ones go home weekly or monthly, your parents will be very happy to see that you have such a change and growth
Home meetings require skills, such as how to study Life Lessons, how to read the Scriptures, how to sing hymns, and how to speak
After you have sown the seeds of real flowers, they still need two to three months of watering and fertilizing before they can grow
Once there was an elderly sister, a Norwegian missionary, who took a boat from Shanghai to Tientsin in the north
The reason why a person has opinions is that he has his viewpoints and perspectives, and because of his points of view, he has opinions
Our habits, the influence of our friends, our experiences of life, and other matters all make up our particular viewpoints
If someone brings up a certain matter, we should not answer it in a casual way but always answer it with assurance
A Chinese saying declares, 'If three of us advance together, at least one of the other two is able to be my teacher'
The meaning of the Chinese word teacher indicates that regardless of who the person is, there is always something for us to learn from him
Whether we are young or old, when we go to have a home meeting, we need to learn from one another and study together, lest we labor in vain
When we go the first time, they may give us a warm face, but the second time we go, they may give us a frowning face
As we are taking the new way, we study while we practice and proceed, and we are prepared to make any adjustments
We are willing to have a thorough study concerning all these things so that we may have a guiding principle to go on in the future
It is not sufficient for us to have a meeting once a week for half an hour or fifty minutes according to our old method
After meeting in a home for several weeks, we need to let the new ones actively lead the meeting instead of taking the initiative ourselves
If this characteristic is treated improperly, it becomes sin, but the characteristic of eating itself is not sin
According to statistics, a large number of famous athletes have died young because they over-exercised and damaged their bodies
For the health and growth of the new ones, we must help them to care for the 'natural law of eating' by functioning in the home meetings
In the past few decades since the Second World War, Christianity has not published a single book of great spiritual value
Beginning from 1828 when the Brethren were raised up, many spiritual books of great value were published, especially in England
The reason for the decline is that instead of being built up, the whole of Christianity is being organized with various traditional methods
For singing there is the music minister, for praying there is the praying minister, and for preaching there is the preaching minister
To be sure, among them are some devout persons, but in general all who attend the Sunday services go in a loose way without any requirements
The first denomination is the state church, the Anglican Church, which is also called the Episcopal Church or the Church of England
Their numbers were 2,500,000 in 1970, 2,100,000 in 1980, 1,980,000 in 1985, and the prediction for 1990 is 1,800,000
Their numbers were 1,700,000 in 1970, 1,400,000 in 1980, 1,300,000 in 1985, and the prediction for 1990 is 1,200,000
The number in the Baptist Church was 870,000 in 1970, 700,000 in 1980, 640,000 in 1985, and the prediction for 1990 is 580,000
The Methodist Church, also called the Wesleyan Church, being founded by John Wesley, is also included in this trend
Their numbers were 2,650,000 in 1970, 2,300,000 in 1980, 2,130,000 in 1985, and the prediction for 1990 is 1,960,000
As for the Pentecostal Church, there were 91,000 in 1970, 89,000 in 1980, 78,000 in 1985, and an estimate of 71,000 in 1990
It was not in existence in 1970, but the number in 1980 was 25,000, in 1985 was 89,000, and the prediction for 1990 is 145,000
Within the twenty years between 1970 and 1990 all the major sects and denominations including the larger ones have been decreasing in number
A person's education progresses from kindergarten, through elementary school, junior high, high school, and then college
In the past even an illiterate person could work in a factory, but today to work in a factory requires a minimum of a junior high education
In the past thirty-nine years, he has been all over the globe, traveling to many countries and holding numerous evangelistic meetings
Even though he has worked in this way for thirty-nine years, the number of people in Christianity is still diminishing
Despite this prosperous circumstance, after thirty-nine years the number of people in Christianity is still dropping
The reason for our change of system is that we do not want to take the way of chance, the way of inviting famous people to give speeches
We chose to come here because there are so many young people here who have already worked hard for sixteen years
Since we are in the procession of the Lords recovery we should reject the degraded practice of Christianity and take Gods ordained new way
We need to endeavor not only to enter into them but also to develop them, so that every home meeting will become our Canaan, the good land
For this we need to strengthen our prayers be strong to receive the burden and do our best to labor on every home and strengthen every home
We should not make a schedule to be in one home meeting for fifty minutes and then attend another meeting for another fifty minutes
After putting in so much effort, we do not want to see that all the homes are unstable and that none of them is a Canaan
According to the district they are in, we should take them to the meeting hall to attend the Lord's table meeting
We have already heard the good news that some churches want to stand in one accord with the Lord's move today in gospelizing Taiwan
The original intention of the training was that the trainees should return to where they came from to serve there
In order to gospelize Taiwan, we must first gospelize the communities of Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and then Tainan
After we gospelize all the communities in the big cities, we can then propagate out from the city centers to towns and villages
Every year, there are college graduates joining the full-time service, and the training also continues every year
The result we obtain should not be something rigid but something living and abiding as our Canaan, the good land
We who lead the home meetings are already familiar with these messages, so we should share and minister to the new ones a little each time
We need to pray much more, endeavor in one accord toward this goal, and concentrate all of our strength on the home meetings
We will continue to study to take the home meetings further so that the Lord will have a way to accomplish His heart's desire
Through our practical experience we can say that gaining the new ones by door-knocking is not a difficult matter
Today there are many zealous Christians who serve the Lord fervently, and they are willing to pay whatever price is required
In the New Testament there are phrases in Greek such as the life of God, the love of God, and the power of God
The life of God means that God is life, the love of God means that God is love, and the power of God means that God is power
John 4:8 says that God is love, and speaking in another way verse 9 says, 'The love of God was manifested among us'
Although He is God and is life if He had not passed through many processes He could not be our life and He would not be able to dwell in us
For God to dispense Himself into us and enter into us to be our life, He needed to pass through various processes
After the fall of man, man was contaminated and corrupted by sin inwardly, which caused the body that God created to become flesh
Romans 3:20 says that out of the works of the law no flesh, that is, no man of blood and flesh, shall be justified before Him
At the time God was incarnated, two thousand years ago, man was no longer in the condition in which God originally had created him
Romans 8:3 says, 'God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh'
When the Son of God came in the flesh, He came not merely in the likeness of the flesh but in the likeness of the flesh of sin
When the bronze serpent was lifted up on the pole, the children of Israel who looked upon the bronze serpent lived
The Bible says clearly, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
For God to enter into us and to be our life, the first process that He went through was the process of incarnation
When the Lord was on the earth, He was not in the likeness of a pure, complete, undefiled, and uncorrupted man
According to the book of Colossians, while He was passing through death, there was a spiritual warfare at the cross
After He entered into resurrection, He was still in the midst of the disciples and stayed on the earth for forty days and nights
They continued walking until they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther
When the Lord Jesus broke the loaf, the eyes of the two disciples were opened and they recognized that He was the Lord
As they were speaking these things, the Lord Jesus appeared again and stood in their midst and said to them, 'Peace to you'
In addition, He completed the experience of human living, accomplished an all-inclusive death, and entered into resurrection
On the other hand, you may say that He is physical, but He was able to enter into a room where the doors were shut
When these words are spoken and when they touch the spirit of a person this person is enlightened to say Lord Jesus and He enters into him
He enters into man with His human living, death, resurrection, His divinity, and His humanity, to be man's life
When we lead them in the home meetings, they enjoy it very much, and when we visit their homes, they welcome us
We need to bring them into the Triune God who dwells in them so that they may have the fellowship of life with Him
For those who have reached this stage, we need to bring them into the experience of fellowshipping with the Lord
Not only did the Lord Jesus have the experiences of the two aspects, but the disciples also had these experiences
It speaks of the function of the inward filling of the Holy Spirit in us and our condition after being filled inwardly
Before dusting, we may not realize that there is so much dust, but the more we dust, the more the dust comes out
We should not confess our sins in a casual way, like someone who cleans only the areas that can be seen and not the ones that cannot be seen
If you go to such a person's home, you will dare not look underneath his bed or in the corners of the house where there are piles of dust
When we sense that we have sins, we should begin to confess them, not only the big ones but also the small ones
When we lead them to confess their sins, we do not need to purposely dig out their old account but simply lead them to confess
When they have confessed one item, another item will come, one item after another, and they will continue to confess to the Lord
If the people we lead do not have such an experience, it is definite that they still have not entered into the fellowship of life
We must lead those we care for to such an extent that they will truly be stabilized and have a solid foundation
As they touch the Spirit within and have fellowship with the Lord within, they will live in the Lord spontaneously
Anyone who seeks to be filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly must have prayers of his own, preferably with no one else present
Those who seek to be thoroughly filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly must confess their sins thoroughly before the Lord themselves
We need to pay attention to the new ones we lead to see whether they have had a thorough confession of their sins after their repentance
We have to realize the importance of this matter and lead them to have an experience of the most serious and thorough confession of sins
It means that confessing our sins empties out our being within, allowing the Holy Spirit to gain the proper ground within us
One thing worth mentioning is that we need to help them to see that confession of sins and clearance of the old living are different matters
In the beginning our scale was very small, the situation was very difficult, and what the Lord had shown us was very limited
In particular, for thirty-eight years the Lord has led His recovery overseas, and in these years the Lord has shown us very many new things
When the Lord's recovery reached the United States, the truth, knowledge, and experience of life had already reached a level of maturity
In terms of the practice of the truth and the real increase and spread of the church, we have had certain discoveries
Prior to October of 1984, we practiced the truth, preached the gospel, established churches, and lived the church life
A person does not need to be a Christian, understand the truth, or read the Bible, but he can still keep the so-called Sunday service
If we lead them only to have meetings in their homes, they will not feel that this is what they expect of Christianity
Even if we bring them to the meeting hall, they may look around and wonder where the bell, the cross, the pastor, and the choir are
Beginning from Brother Nee, we have felt like security guards on duty, fearing that if we doze off slightly, something improper will come in
From time to time someone would open all the doors and windows to the rain, or even tear down the ceiling altogether
It is to thoroughly abolish the strength of the activity in the Body of Christ, causing every member of the Body to be bound
As a result, this caused us to be almost the same as Christianity in that the members rarely functioned and had no way to function
In this kind of atmosphere, not only were many not alerted to the situation, but they even thought that they were being helped
After working for six days, they could finally manage to put away all of their business affairs and take a break
We all may be zealous to preach the gospel to bring people to salvation, but after people are baptized, what should we do?
The results we found are first that there must be a way to allow the gospel to enter into people and to allow the Lord to gain them
Another one testified that one of his neighbors was about to commit suicide, and another neighbor was about to be divorced
If the number of people increased, we would set up a district meeting for the sake of convenience to accommodate everyone
To meet in a big meeting every day is not easy, but to meet in a small meeting every day, or even twice a day, is affordable
Today the church life in the Lord's recovery should balance all of us so that we may have a comprehensive view
We cannot 'pull up a seedling, hoping to make it grow faster,' that is, to force or drag a new one to the meeting hall
After Acts, from Romans to Revelation, the situations of the churches in the Epistles were not the same, but their faith was absolutely one
There are also differences in complexion and color; some faces are black, while others are white, red, or brown
Similarly, in the church life every home may have a different appearance, but the principle in each one is the same
People from different countries, and sometimes people even from the same country, do not all eat the same thing
It is not a small matter to be able to have the Lord's table in every home and for every home to say amen to our coming
Regardless of how meals change over time, the food created by God with its nutritious elements and essences remains unchanged
We announce Him in all wisdom, not only with Truth Lessons or with Life Lessons, but in all wisdom and every kind of wisdom
In these passages of the Scriptures, Paul shows us not only the mystery of God hidden throughout the ages but also the all-inclusive Christ
In Colossians 1:27 he says, 'What are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory'
On the one hand, you refers to the New Testament readers; on the other hand, us refers to the apostles at that time
He preached Christ to others, hoping that one day they would grow up unto maturity and become perfect and complete
If there is a blemish in a precious stone, it is not perfect, and if it is lacking a corner, it is not complete
The Greek word for struggling is used to describe the struggling, contending, wrestling, and fighting of athletes in the Olympic games
The kingdom is like a man who was about to go abroad, called his own slaves, and delivered to them his possessions
If we are those willing to struggle for the Lord, the Lord will be able to gain much and even recover what is His with interest
Although we are not the ones who sowed, the Lord has already sown through others, so all we need to do is to reap
These persons were brought in during 1963, 1964, and no later than 1965 when the work in the United States first began
Eventually in 1970 at the International Conference in Los Angeles, a revival was ushered in as a result of our meetings
Many of the saints were praising and leaping, although they were also shedding tears, being reluctant to depart from Los Angeles
That wave of migration resulted in the spread to between twenty and thirty localities, such as Chicago and other places
In a conference at the Los Angeles Convention Center in 1973, the number of attendants exceeded three thousand
The word dynamo, which we derive from the Greek word for power, is used to describe the operating force of electricity
After being gained by the Lord, a certain brother of Jewish descent traveled not only throughout the United States but also to Taiwan
Today there are many in Christianity both in the Far East and in the United States who use our materials for preaching
At the time Paul came out to preach the gospel, the Lord had used the Roman Empire to open the area around the Middle East
Those who are serving full-time in various localities should continue to go door-knocking, gaining at least one person every week
Today there are many churches in the Lord's recovery, and they will not forsake you, but you should not have the intention to rely on them
A slothful person will not gain anything, but if we are diligent to seize the time, opportunities and success will be in our hands
The most important thing to bear in mind after we have received this ministry is that we should not lose heart
On the one hand, we do not lose heart, but on the other hand, we also need to abandon, renounce, the hidden things of shame
We may disagree with people, but we cannot say one thing outwardly while thinking another thing behind their back
The Lord not only reveals to us the mystery of God but also shows us that this mystery is both on the Lord's side and on ours
Some people have attained doctorate degrees, become high-ranking officials, and even become affluent, but they feel that life is meaningless
In addition, we have also seen that there is a power within us, and now what we need is simply to labor and struggle
Corinthians 3:6 says, 'Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit'
In Chinese we sometimes add the word many in order to distinguish the two words, speaking of the 'many ministers' of the new covenant
Today as the many ministers of the new covenant we are not of the dead ordinances, the dead scripture, or the dead knowledge
Perhaps some will say that they are not merely fulfilling duties; they are sincere and true, keeping a time with the Lord every day
One may pray, confess his sins, and seek the filling of the Holy Spirit sincerely and truly yet still not touch the spirit even a little
If someone asks you why you pray in this way, you may answer that it is because the Bible teaches us to do this
He can hang artificial fruit on the trees, but that kind of fruit is 'of the letter,' and the trees themselves will be 'of the letter'
Artificial fruit is not the fruit of life that is cultivated, grown, developed, and borne through the life within the trees
If the expression of our life is merely an outward hanging of fruit, it is only a decoration, not the issue of our life within
To keep ordinances is easy, and to pick up new things is also easy, but to properly build up our character is not easy
Their true outward expression depends not on how hard they try to perform but on the normal growth of the life within them
A person's expressions and feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are the manifestations of the actual weight of his life
To my impression, however, their character now is not much different from what it was when they were twenty-five
Some of them now have gotten married and had children, and some of their children have already graduated from college
The Bible tells us that as those who serve the Lord, elders and deacons should have the same kind of character, one which is 'grave'
Please remember, though, that gravity depends not on age but on how much weight one has and how much element of life is within him
If what is within you is 'cotton fluff,' you will have no weight, but if what is within you is gold, you will be very weighty
We are ministers of the new covenant, those who are regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed by God, and inwardly filled with God
According to the usage in the New Testament, image refers not merely to an outward form but to the outward expression of the inner being
The expression of what we are is our image; our image is exactly according to who we are inwardly in our being
We as the ministers of the new covenant must definitely remember that we are not of the letter, ordinances, teachings, or certain methods
To say that something is of gold means that it has some gold in it, but to say that it is gold means that the whole object is gold
A golden necklace, for example, may not merely be of gold, that is, plated with gold; rather, it may be entirely of gold
When we become those who are filled with the Spirit, the words we speak will be spirit, and the work we do will also be spirit
The extent to which we know and experience Christ as the mystery of God is the extent to which we are spiritual
Our Christian life should be the life portrayed in the Gospels, one of denying the self and taking up the cross to follow the Lord
Rather, it means that today we need to live a life of denying our self, putting the self aside, and inwardly receiving Christ as life
To be sure, we announce Christ, but now He is no longer only the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended One
In verse 20 Paul said, 'As always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death'
In our daily living we must learn to experience Christ so that day after day He will become a subjective Christ to us
We should not go out with a mere saying that 'to me, to live is Christ' without being those in whom Christ can be found
God's New Testament economy is to carry out the mystery of God, and this mystery is the content of the New Testament economy
God's economy in the Old Testament was expressed only in the small sphere of the Jews who occupied a small piece of land
When sunlight is obscured by the clouds, the sun itself is hidden, but when sunlight appears, the sun is expressed
In the same way, when God hides Himself, the glory recedes, and when God is expressed, the glory shines, since glory is God Himself
The riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles refers not only to Christ but also to Christ in us becoming the hope of glory
Although Paul's utterance in Colossians 1:27 is simple, it includes many crucial words, such as mystery, glory, riches, hope, and Christ
What we need is a living Christ, who enters into us and becomes our glory, hope, and the riches that we enjoy inwardly
Our door-knocking is for this purpose, our home meetings are for this, and our teaching of Life Lessons is also for this
We need to learn to exercise not only one kind of wisdom but 'all' wisdom, which includes various kinds of wisdom
Some young ones who have taken the new way think that the older ones and those who have not taken the new way are out-of-date
Whether the new ones should meet in the meeting hall or in the community on the Lord's Day requires our exercise of all wisdom
Paul exhorted the saints there to stand firm in one spirit, having one soul, and to think the same thing, the one thing
Kings 4:29 says, 'And God gave Solomon wisdom and very much understanding and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore'
We should not mind the way people treat us, and we should not have our own feeling of how to break bread and how to meet
When Paul worked on earth, he considered himself as that kind of person, one who did not care for his own life
God gave this grace to Paul so that he could announce the unsearchable riches of Christ the riches he had seen and experienced as the gospel
The mystery, which throughout the ages was hidden in God who created all things, is the mystery of the universe
When we go out, we each should be a small 'video player,' opening our mouth to show a scene to people in the home meetings
Whenever we meet, there should be the showing of a 'video' so that we will not only hear something but also see the shining of the light
If people were asked to advance to preach the gospel of life or the gospel of the kingdom, they would be at a loss
God created the heavens, the earth, and all things to testify for Himself so that man can know God through His wonderful works
Romans begins from man's sins in chapter one and ascends all the way to speak about the mystery hidden in the times of the ages
The great mystery of godliness mentioned in 1 Timothy is a primary principle, but how much we are related to it is still in question
When we say that man was created by God according to His own image, we mean that man was created by God according to Christ
Man being created according to Gods image is the literal fact but its intrinsic meaning is that Gods creation of man was according to Christ
In the beginning God created man according to Christ, but the created man did not know for what purpose he existed
One day this God with His mystery entered into a woman among mankind and was conceived, and afterward He came out from her womb
When He was on the earth, people surrounded Him, dwelt with Him, and walked and lived with Him, but no one truly knew Him
Due to the incarnation, the mystery that was originally in the God of the universe was now found in a man in this universe
At the time of the apostle Paul, different philosophies, particularly Greek philosophy, flourished around the Mediterranean Sea
The ancient Babylonian and Egyptian cultures, and especially the Greek culture, had all reached the Mediterranean Sea
Even in this philosophy no one knew that the mystery originally in God had now entered into a person and had become the mystery in man
After the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, the gospel was preached to people of the nations around the Mediterranean Sea
Even the Gnostics who had a high reputation at that time and whose philosophical theories were very mysterious had no vision of this mystery
After four thousand years, many things had happened among mankind, but this mystery was still in God and had not yet entered into man
After Christ's death and resurrection, the mystery that entered into that man was reproduced, multiplied, and duplicated
In God there is a mystery in Christ there is a mystery in every one of us there is a mystery and in the whole church there is also a mystery
The mystery in us is in the church, the mystery in the church is in Christ, and the mystery in Christ is in God
Why was there an Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Solomon, and all the prophets?
When Saul of Tarsus met the Lord on the way to Damascus, the Lord asked him a little question, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me'?
Once the mystery is gone, the so-called church becomes a denomination, and we Christians are merely religionists
The more we try to answer them, though, the more easily we fall into a trap and the more they will not understand
In the beginning, the mystery that was in God was kept in silence, and today it is hard for us to break the silence
Perhaps after a certain period of time they can say, 'You are truly different compared to what you were five years ago'
The mystery in God has been duplicated and reproduced in man, that is, in you and me, causing us to become a mystery
When we go to knock on doors, we should not be afraid of people's opposition, because there will be God's sons of peace
Today if we cannot produce this kind of condition when we lead people everywhere to follow the Lord, we are not yet a mystery
As a result, the people whom we lead and help will be able to know Christ in a subjective way, not merely in a doctrinal way
The reason for this is that they do not have a spirit of developing new territories, endeavoring to advance, and desiring to learn further
Even if the employees have already obtained doctorate degrees, the company will still encourage them to continue learning

Apparently, we who work for the Lord can do the work whether or not we are willing to learn and use dictionaries, for example
But many, who know astronomy, geography, business, economics, and other subjects, because all these are related to human living
In the Chinese educational system, economics is an all-inclusive subject, but the Lord's work is even more inclusive than economics
Even though the people in the news may not have believed in the Lord, they are still the outstanding ones in human society
Besides our native Chinese language, we must also learn English and Spanish, and if possible, we should know German and French
When certain American brothers came to Taiwan, they learned a little Chinese, so it is now much easier to converse with them
In the same way, if we cannot communicate in people's native languages when we go overseas, it will be as if we are deaf and dumb
For the most part, all learning must be self-initiated, for example, through reading more literature and using dictionaries
Every young person who desires to serve the Lord should memorize 1 and 2 Timothy and diligently study every point mentioned in them
Paul was referring to the way athletes in the Olympics exercised their bodies, saying that we Christians also must exercise unto godliness

He may not learn many good things at home, in school, or in the human community, but instead he may unconsciously learn many bad things
It seems reasonable to push one's way onto a bench where there is more room, but in actuality it is not proper
Today our society is chaotic and full of competition, but in the church life we should be separated and in a proper order
One day in the meeting, however, a large brother may sit on a bench and not leave enough room for three others
On the other hand, the large brother needs to realize that he may inconvenience others, particularly in the meetings
In the meeting he should not sit so as to convenience himself but rather occupy only three-quarters of the space he needs
On the other hand, if you room with someone who snores and keeps you from sleeping, you need to accept it in peace
We need this in our dealing with our family, our dealing with others, and all the more in our co-working with others
According to the Lord's ordination, a husband and a wife cannot be divorced, and neither one can abandon his or her own children

2 Timothy 1:7 says, 'For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness'
In addition, other passages in 1 and 2 Timothy speak of the exercise related to our sober mind, which is a part of our soul
Timothy 1:7 says, 'For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness'
God is the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-and man is a tripartite being of spirit, soul, and body
When the spirit wants to come out, the will of the soul must be strong, and the emotion of the soul must be filled with love
Whether in making money or in sleeping, if a person has no control, there is something wrong with his mental condition
They have gotten off track because their mind is unbalanced, and their spirit is not strong enough to rule and reign over their mind

Because of the large number of people in the church life, it is difficult to avoid friction, so we may spontaneously give people a long face
There are often things that make us happy in the church life, so we may burst into laughter in an unruly manner
Our outburst of laughter when we are happy is in the soul, and our giving people a long face when we are unhappy is also in the soul
A long, frowning face is one of the appearances of the soul, and a smiling, laughing face is another appearance of the soul
If you want something from the sisters, the most effective way is not to say much but to shed tears in front of them
In the family life there are often quarrels because the husband keeps too clear of an account, while the wife's thinking is muddled
If the spirit wants to laugh, we laugh, if the spirit wants to weep, we weep, and if the spirit is silent, we do nothing
When we lead people to salvation through door-knocking, we help those who have believed and received the Lord to pray
Rather, we all must have the habit of exercising the spirit so that when we simply talk to people, our spirit comes out
Certain Bible-teaching denominations tell people that once they enter the meeting, they must remain silent enough to hear a pin drop
Once we exercise to live out God, we will be able to lay hold on the eternal life, which is the life of God, God Himself
If we live by ourselves, what we live out will definitely not be God, but if we live by the life of God, what we live out will be God
People in the world think that this refers to everlasting life, the everlasting blessing that they will enjoy when they go to heaven
When Christ was on the earth, the Pharisees and Sadducees hated Him because He fought the good fight against them
Christ is the embodiment of God, and grace is the Triune God dispensing Himself in His embodiment into us as our enjoyment
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'

The booklet tells us that man was created by God as His vessel His container for the purpose of containing God who enters into mans spirit
Since we have been begotten of God, we certainly are 'gods,' that is, the children of God, who are the same as He is
We are children of God and the same as God, but this does not mean that we have the status and person of the Godhead
As a result of all of the above, we know how to conduct ourselves and how to go out of and come into the house of God, which is the church
In the house of God we know how to deal with different kinds of people, fellowship with them, receive their help, and take care of them
In conclusion, those who go door-knocking to bring people to salvation and baptism must have the spirit of the Olympic athletes
At this time there are about eight thousand five hundred new ones under our care, and we have meetings in their homes
We need five hundred who have passed through the training to continue to take care of the newly baptized ones in the home meetings
All these saints from overseas were sent by the churches in their localities and are supported by their respective localities
We are joyful that the saints speaking foreign languages can join this work, but we will ask you to learn Chinese
Otherwise, if you still need translation while contacting people, you will not be capable of taking care of the home meetings
Their ability to speak both Chinese and English in the gospel work is appreciated very much by all the gospel friends
When the gospel friends see you and realize that even as Americans you can speak Chinese, you will win over their hearts
If the respective localities of the full-time serving ones from overseas joyfully consent to their remaining, we will be very pleased
You must first gain a joyful amen from your respective localities, and if you will remain here, you must learn Chinese diligently
Do not be concerned only with money, thinking that you need to fellowship with the church only because the church is supporting you
For those of you who support yourselves, you still need to obtain a joyful amen from the church in your locality

When they went door-knocking in the villages, the villagers had already agreed among themselves that they would not open their doors to them
According to a true story, an American brother from the Presbyterian Church was very wise; he was as prudent as a serpent
He stood outside the door for fifteen minutes to half an hour until the people inside would crack open the door
When this brother saw the opening, he would thrust in his walking stick so that the people inside were not able to close the door
The missionaries knew that the Chinese are kind and loving in nature and are not barbarous, so they dared to go inside the house
The missionaries studied and learned about this, so when they entered the house, they would run to the mill and begin to grind diligently

We all have to be clear that in the Lord's recovery we follow the revelation of the Bible and the patterns in the Bible
English is a necessity; the other language may be German or Spanish, or another language such as Greek and Hebrew
We have one leading and one ministry among us because all the churches on the earth are for the Lord's recovery
For any of them to suggest that they build a tower or a different ark would have been to raise up a different ministry
In the age of Moses His ministry was to build the tabernacle with all its utensils, especially the Ark of the Covenant
When we say that we are under one leading, what we mean is that we are under the leading of the New Testament ministry
