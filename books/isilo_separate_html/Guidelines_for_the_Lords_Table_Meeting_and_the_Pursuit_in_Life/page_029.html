AND MAN&rsquo;S RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
<p><em>Question: What does &ldquo;many first will be last, and many last first&rdquo; mean (Matt. 19:30; 20:16)?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should realize that there are always two sides to the truths in the Bible. The things in the physical world have this same principle. For example, our head has a front side with seven &ldquo;holes&rdquo; and a back side with no &ldquo;holes.&rdquo; In the universe, according to Chinese philosophy, there are <em>yin</em> and <em>yang,</em> males and females, the sun and the moon. This simply reflects a law in the universe that everything has two sides. In spiritual matters, from God&rsquo;s side, everything is related to His mercy; from man&rsquo;s side, everything is related to man&rsquo;s responsibility. Let us consider the matter of salvation. From God&rsquo;s side, if He had not predestinated us to enter His kingdom, we would be unable to enter, regardless of how much we strive and struggle. From man&rsquo;s side, if we would not believe and receive the gospel, we cannot enter the kingdom of God. Hence, some say that salvation is a matter of God&rsquo;s predestination, and others say that it is a matter of man&rsquo;s responsibility. There is no need for debate. From the side of God in heaven, it is God&rsquo;s predestination; from the side of man on earth, it is man&rsquo;s responsibility. D. L. Moody has said rightly that on the outside of the entrance to God&rsquo;s kingdom, it is written, &ldquo;Whosoever will may come&rdquo;; however, once inside, it is written, &ldquo;Chosen before the foundation of the world.&rdquo; A student of D. L. Moody once asked him, &ldquo;There is no doubt that salvation is predestinated by God, but when we go out to preach the gospel, what will happen if someone whom God has not predestinated believes?&rdquo; Moody answered, &ldquo;My child, just go ahead and speak. All who believe through your speaking have been predestinated by God.&rdquo; The same seed of life is sown into us, but in some it will bear fruit and produce thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, some a hundredfold, but some will not bear even twofold. This shows man&rsquo;s responsibility. To yield thirtyfold is good, to yield sixtyfold is better, to yield a hundredfold is the best, yet to yield nothing is the worst. This is the responsibility that man bears. Whether a seed can grow is God&rsquo;s responsibility, but whether a seed can be sown into man is man&rsquo;s responsibility. Whether or not God allows us to hear His word is His responsibility, but whether we receive His word is our responsibility. If we have a distracting mind, we will miss God&rsquo;s shining and will be unable to receive God&rsquo;s speaking. Therefore, we must stop our thoughts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL MATTERS DEPENDING ON &ldquo;SEEING&rdquo;</h2>
<p><em>Question: The Lord Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit to be tempted by the devil (Matt. 4:1). Since we have received the Holy Spirit after believing into the Lord and being baptized, what should we do when the Holy Spirit leads us and evil spirits follow?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Many times, spiritual things may not be our reality; instead, they may merely be thoughts in our mind. Hence, we should look to the Lord in His presence and learn to stop these thoughts. We should not think that when the Holy Spirit leads us, evil spirits are always involved. The spiritual fact is that the Holy Spirit has been in us since the day we were saved and baptized. We should simply believe this fact, and spend more time to consider the Lord and draw near to Him, not allowing ourselves to be distracted in our mind about thoughts of evil spirits.</p>
<p>I have already said that in matters pertaining to our spiritual life, the most important thing is seeing. The Lord Jesus once said of the Jews that although they had seen Him in the flesh, they had not really seen Him (Matt. 13:13; John 12:40-41). If they had seen Him, they would not have forsaken and crucified Him. The reason the Jews crucified Him was that they had not seen Him.</p>
<p>There are three aspects of seeing. First, God must unveil the spiritual things to us. For example, if I am hiding something, you will be unable to see it unless I show it to you. If you want me to show it to you, you will either need to beg me, or, without your begging, I may voluntarily show it to you. If God does not show, unveil, His mysteries to us, we will be unable to see them. Hence, the first point concerning seeing is God&rsquo;s unveiling, showing, His mysteries to us. Christ is the mystery of God, and the cross is also a mystery. If God does not reveal Christ and the cross to us, none of us will be able to understand them. Thus, the first point about seeing is God&rsquo;s unveiling. It is only when God pulls open the veil in heaven, making known to us the heavenly mysteries, that we can know Christ and His cross.</p>
<p>Second, we need the veil taken away from our eyes that we may see. If we are blind, we will be unable to see anything. Hence, if we want to see, our eyes must be opened; they must be bright. If God unveils a certain matter to us, but we do not have eyes that can see, His revelation will be useless. In order for us to see what God has unveiled, our eyes must be able to see.</p>
<p>Third, there must be light. If we want to see an object, it must first be placed before us; then, we need eyes that can see; and finally, there must be light. Even if our sight is normal, we will be unable to see an object placed before us in the darkness of night. Hence, seeing spiritual matters depends on God&rsquo;s unveiling, our eyes being able to see, and God&rsquo;s shining. God&rsquo;s unveiling is His revelation. For example, Christ and the cross may have been mysteries behind the veil, but one day God will lift the veil and show us Christ and His cross. This is revelation. At this time our eyes must be open to see, and there must be the shining of light to enable us to see this spiritual matter. Therefore, revelation plus sight plus light equal seeing. Our seeing is called a vision. If our eyes are opened and God&rsquo;s light is shining, we will immediately see Christ when God reveals Him to us. This is a vision.</p>
<p>God has already lifted the veil in heaven. The problem is whether or not our eyes can see. Since God has given us revelation, He is surely willing to grant us light. There is thus no problem on God&rsquo;s side with the first and the third aspects. The problem on our side is that we may not have eyes that see. If we have revelation and there is light, we will not see anything if we do not have sight.</p>
<p>Many people have revelation but no vision, because their eyes are not opened. Many among us are blind, even though we have revelation, and the Spirit of God is doing a shining work here. This is our biggest problem. Whether we have eyes that see is our responsibility. Many of our concepts, views, and ideas are veils that hinder us from seeing. In order for the veils to be removed, we need to stop and reject all of our natural thoughts and ideas. Otherwise, we may think and think until the Lord comes back, and still be unable to see. If we do not stop analyzing, our eyes will be blurred, and we will not be able to see. Even if we do see, it will not be clearly. Some people in our meetings do not really want to see; they are satisfied with merely coming to the meetings. Thus, they see very little.</p>
<p>We must see that spiritual matters depend entirely on seeing. When there is seeing, there will spontaneously be believing, but without seeing, there cannot be believing. Once we see something, we cannot help but believe. Therefore, we need to remember that spiritual matters depend on our seeing. Christ is all-inclusive, but our experience requires that we have eyes that can see. If we have sight, we will see His all-inclusiveness; we will see that His death is all-inclusive and that His riches are all-inclusive.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DISTRACTING THOUGHTS HINDERING US FROM SEEING</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s natural thinking is a big hindrance to God, because it restricts God. Spiritual matters are not for our study or analysis but for our eating, digesting, and receiving. We simply need to eat. Some people may ask, &ldquo;What if we do not eat properly and become sick?&rdquo; Such unnecessary questions hinder us from taking in what God has revealed to us. It will be difficult for us to see light if, after hearing a message, we ask endless questions. For example, a head chef may prepare a delicious dish for us, but instead of eating, we may ask, &ldquo;Does the food contain bacteria? What if we become sick after we eat it?&rdquo; What would the chef do? He would say, &ldquo;I put out a delicious dish for you to eat, not for you to study.&rdquo; When some people see a &ldquo;delicious dish,&rdquo; that is, when they hear a message, they do not analyze in their mind, rather, they open their &ldquo;mouth&rdquo; and take in everything spoken in the message, including the all-inclusive death of Christ and His all-inclusive riches.</p>
<p>We may use another illustration. After hearing a message concerning the four living creatures, represented by a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle, some may ask, &ldquo;What about fish?&rdquo; As soon as they ask this question, everything that they have heard becomes null and void. None of the truths, not even the truth related to Christ or His cross, can enter into us if all we have are questions. This kind of situation is a &ldquo;dead-end&rdquo; street, and we will be filled with all kinds of strange ideas that are simply rubbish. We need to see that all these troubling and distracting thoughts hinder us from seeing clearly; hence, we do not have a vision.</p>
<p>Writers always like to make inferences, but it is altogether wrong to make inferences in relation to seeing a vision. We need to look to the Lord for His mercy and grace that we would have eyes to see, stop all our thinking, and simply receive what He reveals to us. When reading the Bible, we should stop all our thoughts in order to see. In the same way, when listening to God&rsquo;s word, we need to stop our entire being, including our natural thoughts, so that we may see the revelation in God&rsquo;s word. God has no way to show us anything if our mind is racing. The main reason that many saints are blurred in their vision is because of their distracting thoughts. When people speak to us, we should stop all our thoughts, even if we think that we are experienced; otherwise, we will be unable to hear what is being said. In order to hear, we must stop our natural thoughts. The reason we cannot see is that we have not stopped these distracting thoughts.</p>
<p>We need to go to the Lord and ask Him to grant us sight. We need adequate prayers, sight, revelation, and light. On God&rsquo;s side, there is no problem with revelation and light; on our side, however, very few of us actually have eyes to see and ears to hear. We do not need to study how to hand ourselves over, overcome the flesh, or be spiritual. Our need is to drop such questions and, instead, go to the Lord and say, &ldquo;O Lord, I want to be as quiet and calm as You are. Grant me the light in this matter. Lord, I do not know what it is to be victorious or holy. I only know that I lack eyes that are clear. I look to You to enable me to see.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
