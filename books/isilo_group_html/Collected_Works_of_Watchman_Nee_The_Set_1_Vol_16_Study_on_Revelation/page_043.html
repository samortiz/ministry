Revelation 12:15</H2><P>"And the serpent cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by its current." </P><P>Since "the serpent" is Satan, the "water" cannot refer just to water, but must refer to something else. From Jeremiah 46:7-8 we know that water represents the advance of a hostile army (see also Jer. 47:2-4; Isa. 59:19). Hence, the dragon's use of water to pursue the woman must refer to his use of the armies of the nations to pursue the children of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Revelation 12:16</H2><P>"And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth."</P><P>"The earth" is the earth. In Exodus 15:10 God used water to drown the armies of Egypt, and in Numbers 16:30 He opened the earth to swallow up people. God will use His ways to protect the chosen Jews.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Revelation 12:17</H2><P>"And the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus." </P><P>"The rest of her seed" includes the faithful Jews and the remaining Christians. If this were to refer only to the Jews, it could only be said that they keep the commandments of God; it could not be said that they bear the testimony of Jesus. (At this point the Lord has not yet come, and the Jews have not yet believed in Him.) "The saints" in 13:7 refer to both the Jews and the remaining Christians. They are "the rest of her seed." </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE BEAST COMING UP OUT OF THE SEA<br>(REVELATION 12:18-13:10)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 12:18</H2><P>"And he stood on the sand of the sea." </P><P>Revelation 12:18 should be connected to the first part of 13:1. "The sand of the sea." "The sea" denotes the Mediterranean, and the "beast" represents either a nation, the Roman Empire, or a person, Antichrist.</P><P>If the beast indicates a nation, then the sea should be interpreted spiritually, but if it indicates a person, then the sea should be just the sea. When interpreted spiritually, the sea always refers to the Gentiles. The earth, interpreted spiritually, indicates the Jews. The types in the Bible concerning the sea and the land always correspond with this. For example, in both Revelation 17:15 and Daniel 7:3, the sea typifies the Gentile world. To come up out of the sea means to come from the Gentile world.</P><P>The beast coming up out of the sea denotes the revival of the Roman Empire. "The sea" speaks of the place from which he comes, and "beast" speaks of his nature. Revelation 9:11 and 11:7 refer to his coming up out of the abyss, and 13:1 speaks of his coming up out of the sea. These two places correspond with each other. To come up means to ascend out of (1 Sam. 28:13-14). We know that the beast is resurrected from the dead because the abyss is where the spirits of the dead are kept.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 13:1</H2><P>"And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and on his heads names of blasphemy." </P><P>The "ten horns" represent ten minor kings (17:12), and the "seven heads" indicate seven major kings (17:10). Heads are larger than horns; they direct the horns. Hence, the seven heads and ten horns must refer to seven emperors and ten minor kings.</P><P>The "seven heads" are successive kings, whereas the ten horns are simultaneous rulers. (The Roman Empire had a total of thirteen Caesars, but among them, five died violently. In the original text, the words "have fallen" in 17:10 mean "have died in a violent way." The sixth Caesar, Domitian, was also killed. Likewise, the seventh will be killed. God mentions seven Roman emperors, each of whom met with a violent death. The ten horns are only subordinate kings of the Roman Empire.)</P><P>Antichrist is the beast and is the seventh head. Revelation 12:3 says, "And on his heads seven diadems." Revelation 13:1 says, "And on his horns ten diadems." In the future, Antichrist will come out of the Roman Empire and will control Europe. According to history, the ten kings in 12:3 have not yet received their diadems and their authority. By the time of 13:1, the ten kings will have received their diadems and their authority. At that time, however, Antichrist will not yet have received his authority. It is in 17:13, when the ten kings crown the beast, that Antichrist receives his authority.</P><P>"And on his heads names of blasphemy." This means that the kings claim to be God. According to history, each of the five Caesars demanded that others worship them as a worship to God. To exalt oneself and to put down God is blasphemy (Matt. 9:3; 26:65; John 5:18; 10:33; Mark 3:28; Rev. 16:21).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
