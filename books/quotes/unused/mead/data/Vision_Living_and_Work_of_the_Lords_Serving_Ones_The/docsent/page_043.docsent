   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN OUR SERVICE BEING TO WORK OUT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SMALL GROUPS BEING STRONG IN SPIRIT, RICH IN THE WORD,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND ABLE TO SING THE HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The young people with a heart to serve the Lord full time are new blood in the churches in Taiwan, in the Lord s recovery, and in the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The burden of the Lord s recovery on the island of Taiwan is to work out the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to work out the small groups, three things are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first thing is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must have a strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our spirit is not strong or is not living, we will be like a robot.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second thing is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must have the Word, and the Word must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to be rich in the Word, we can get the help from the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The third thing is the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to have a successful small group, we must have these three prerequisites; we must be strong in spirit, rich in the Word, and able to sing the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>SEVEN WAYS TO PURSUE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE LIFE-STUDIES IN THE SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are seven ways to make the words in the Life-study messages living to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first way is to read short portions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we read the Life-studies in the small groups, we should not read non-stop.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must learn to read short portions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Take the following portion as an example: The Son of God as the embodiment and expression of God the Father John 1:18; 14:9-11; Heb 1:3 is life to us John 10:10; 1 John 5:12; Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The desire of God s heart is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life John 17:3; 3:16 , and become the sons of God John 1:12; Gal 4:5-6 Life-study of Galatians, p.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not read this portion without any stops.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One person should read, The Son of God, and another person can continue with as the embodiment and expression of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One person should not read more than the Son of God as the embodiment and expression of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we should let another person continue.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should practice reading only a phrase or a clause, and immediately another person should continue with the next phrase or clause.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we practice this, the small group will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second way to make the Life-study messages living is to read with repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that when we come to an important point, we should repeat it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For instance, the phrase the Son of God as the embodiment and expression of God the Father has three important points: the Son of God, the embodiment, and the expression of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is worthwhile to repeat these three points.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should repeat these points until everyone in the small group can say them with ease.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we can conclude by repeating it once more.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the way to read with repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The third way is to read with emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should read the words that need to be stressed with emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From the previous example, the phrases the Son of God, the embodiment, and the expression are quite particular and should be read with emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fourth way is to read with vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This depends on the person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are living, our way of reading will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are rigid, our way of reading will be rigid.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To read a short portion with repetition and emphasis is a matter of skill, but to read with vitality depends on our person, not our skill.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, to read in this way is to read spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not a matter of our voice being high or low but of reading with a living spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should never turn a small group meeting into an exercise routine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more living a small group is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a small group is living, it breaks away from all religious rituals and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The fifth way is to read with explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For instance, when we read the phrase the present evil age Gal 1:4 , we may add a word of explanation and say that the present evil age is the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With the addition of this brief explanation, the meaning of this phrase becomes clear.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This also deepens the impression in the mind of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This kind of brief explanation is better than a long, extended message.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Reading the Word in the small groups requires reading with explanation to open the deep portions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The sixth way is to pray-read, that is, to read with a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When some saints do this, they are almost shouting, not praying.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is no prayer in their reading, no spirit of prayer, or flavor of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, we need to re-learn how to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After someone adds the explanation, The present evil age is the religious world, a second person may pray, Lord, show us that the present evil age is the religious world and that religion is a world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Or another person may pray, Lord, rescue us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rescue us out of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To read prayerfully in this way is pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Pray-reading should be short.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Often when someone in the group prays, others join in and pray at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should avoid this, because it turns the meeting into a group exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In a small group, nothing should be excessive or too long, even though we practice everything in the small group.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This can be compared to having a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is much enjoyment when the food is brought to the table one dish at a time and eaten one course at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The seventh way is to read with singing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There are many tunes in our hymnal that are classics from generations of sacred music; they have a particular style and are dignified, weighty, and elegant.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The young people should learn to sing the hymns more often until they become familiar to them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This will be a great help to the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we read John 10, which is concerning leaving the fold and returning to the flock, we can use Hymns, #1068: In tenderness He sought me, / Weary and sick with sin, / And on His shoulders brought me / Into His flock again...</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>/ Oh, the love that sought me!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>/ Oh, the blood that bought me!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>/ Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To read and sing is to emphasize the words by singing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>LEARNING TO SING THE HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I would like to say a word about the history of our hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Our first hymnal was Hymns for the Little Flock, and it was compiled by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It included one hundred eighty-four hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In 1950 he edited the hymns and published a hymnal with one thousand fifty-two hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This hymnal included gospel hymns that I compiled, and the second volume of the Chinese hymnal was completed in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In 1961 I spent about two months to write eighty-five hymns because we lacked hymns concerning Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In 1962 I went to America to continue the ministry, and I edited and compiled hymns in English.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This work was completed in 1966.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>From 1966 to 1967 I returned to Taiwan and, together with the brothers, rearranged the hymns in Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We compiled a new hymnal with select hymns from past hymnals, new hymns, and various hymns in English that were translated into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This compiling and editing work was finished in 1968.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This hymnal, with seven hundred eighty hymns, is what the churches are using.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This hymnal includes all the best hymns in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When we sing these hymns, we should sing ourselves into them.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then we will realize the value of the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I hope that the young ones will all learn to sing the hymns well.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They should also learn the Chinese language.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We must be living and fresh, and we must be able to write and to compose in Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Human beings are living.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Furthermore, God created a spirit within us and also regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Moreover, the Spirit of God dwells in our spirit, and we and the Triune God have become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Therefore, we should not be stale or in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Those with a desire to serve should be open to learn as much as they can.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>According to a Chinese proverb, there is no limit to our learning.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Hence, we should not only know how to sing hymns but also how to write hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Gradually, we will learn to compose more hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>SMALL GROUPS MEETING EVERYWHERE</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>AND AT ANY TIME</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The practice of the small group is the crucial leading that we have received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It is a great opportunity and a blessing for a young person to serve the Lord full time at this juncture of our history.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We must not be rigid and think that a small group meeting must be held only on Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If an older sister is free Monday mornings, she can invite some neighbors to her home to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This can be considered a small group gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Our spirit should be living.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We should work until there are small groups meeting everywhere and at any time.</S>
