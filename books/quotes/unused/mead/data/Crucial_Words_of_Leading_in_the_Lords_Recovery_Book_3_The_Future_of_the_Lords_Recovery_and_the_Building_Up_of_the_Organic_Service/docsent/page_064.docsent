   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN SPIRITUAL PRINCIPLES IN CHURCH SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will fellowship concerning some of the spiritual principles in the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the preceding messages we fellowshipped concerning the arrangements for the work and the way the full-time serving ones should lead the small groups and how they should advance the gospel in the homes, on the campus, and with the children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The full-time serving ones must also advance the gospel in the community through the brothers and sisters at all levels of society.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not have time to fellowship concerning the details of these points.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These will be left for every locality to decide as they begin working in these areas.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must pray much, have thorough fellowship with one another, and observe the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we can study the practical steps that should be taken.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The steps that we fellowship in this meeting are only general principles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, a person who wants to be healthy must eat at least three meals per day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, he still should study and decide whether he should eat Chinese or American food, whether to eat steamed buns or rice, and whether to use a fork and knife or chopsticks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He does not need special guidance with respect to these details.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>SERVICE NEEDING TO BE ORGANIC</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>NOT ORGANIZATIONAL</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are burdened concerning the purpose of our gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must realize that we are in the Lord and that we are brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such relationships are not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The saved ones in Christian groups are also in the Lord and are brothers and sisters, but we are not meeting with them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have received the Lord s mercy to be gathered together so that we may maintain a corporate testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not agree with the Catholic Church, because the testimony of Catholicism is an error.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also do not agree with the groups in Christianity, because they do not have the proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Still, we need to ask concerning the testimony we should maintain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the ways of human society, organization is necessary in order to accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, we cannot rely on organization.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we reject organization, how should we proceed in the work?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some saints may respond that we should rely on the elders, the deacons, and the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While it is scriptural for elders to administrate the church, we cannot do this in a way of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The general concept in human society is that a church is managed by a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, when a reporter wants to interview someone from a church, he ask s to see the pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not many Christians know about the administration of the church by the eldership, or presbytery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Presbyterians know the term presbytery, but often they do not understand what it means.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was young, I studied in an English junior college that was run by the American Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was a student there, but I did not know who the elders were.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I only knew the names of a few pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One of the pastors was the uncle of one of the brothers among us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was famous in the Presbyterian Church, and he was an eloquent and skillful preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am saying this to show that we did not know what an elder was, but we knew what a pastor was.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord raised up His recovery in China, the first thing we emphasized was the recovery of the practices in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day we saw that in the Bible the administration and leading of the church are carried out by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So we appointed elders.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the Lord s testimony in His recovery in China became stronger, the practice of having elders administrate the church was received by other Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The term elder was commonly used among us, and we became famous for using this term.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today this term has traveled to America.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even Chinese newspapers in America speak of interviewing elders rather than pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regrettably, we have observed that even among us, most brothers and sisters rely on the elders as if they were pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, when we ask how to advance the work, everyone thinks that we must rely on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have given ourselves to serve full time, but who directs us in our service to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To say that the Lord directs us is certainly correct and spiritual, but we must ask what this means.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may say that it means to follow the sense of life, to follow the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot dispute with such an answer, because it is definitely a teaching according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose a sister follows her so-called sense of life, or the anointing of the Spirit, and goes to serve in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although the church in Kaohsiung may acknowledge her burden and allow her to serve on the campus, they may feel that there was no fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They may feel that she is able to carry out a spiritual function, but that she is unable to carry out any practical service.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This shows that when we serve, we cannot be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It does not matter how much of a burden a person has, he cannot accomplish anything alone or independently.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, we have the sense of life, the anointing, and the operating of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the other hand, we are extremely limited in what we can do in the service and must rely on and enjoy the service of other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We cannot be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot exist without the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In other words, if we want to serve the Lord, we must have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Organization is in human society as well as in Catholicism and Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the church revealed in the Bible is not an organization but an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, we must ask ourselves whether the testimony of our service is that of an organization or of an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the testimony of our service is an organism, it is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A group is an organization, but a body is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are not an organization; we are the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All the members of the human body are organic parts.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many people wear false teeth, which are not organic members of their body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>False teeth are an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The difference is that false teeth do not have the life of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only the members with the life of the body can be part of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Things without the life of the body are an organization, even if they are within the body.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The elders should ask themselves whether they are a part of an organism or an organization inside the organism.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the example of the sister in Kaohsiung, she must ask herself whether her service is an organic function or an organization within an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must all ask ourselves this question, and we must answer it with much consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we will realize that whether we are an elder, a co-worker, or a full-time serving one, our motives and element are mainly organizational, not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the focus of this message.</S>
