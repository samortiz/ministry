   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN WITNESSED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This chapter contains the testimonies of five persons who knew Watchman Nee personally.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What they have written concerning him is drawn from their personal knowledge and firsthand experience extending over a period of years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first testimony is that of his brother-in-law, Samuel I. L. Chang, who was an elder in the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His Relationship with Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Watchman Nee's grandmother and my grandmother were classmates in school.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their friendship began the relationship between our two families.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our fathers were also schoolmates, as were our sisters, and in due time he and I also attended the same school.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our relationship, however, was not merely the kind of friendship persons in the world have, but became the kind of relationship which exists between two Christian brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This relationship between us continued down through the years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was through fellowship with Watchman Nee in 1927 that I was made clear concerning my own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1934 he married my sister, but even though he became my brother-in-law, our relationship continued to be based not upon family ties but upon our relationship in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Assurance of Salvation through Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My spiritual relationship with Watchman Nee began when I received the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He ministered Christ to me in the Spirit, bringing me into a genuine and living enjoyment of the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He asked me simply, "Are you saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I replied, "I don't know."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He asked again, "Why are you not saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Again I replied, "I don't know."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then he asked, "Do you believe John 3:16?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He then proceeded to break this verse down, clause by clause: "'God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.'"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He asked, "Do you believe this?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I replied, "Yes, I believe this."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He asked, "Do you believe that 'every one who believes into Him would not perish, but have eternal life'?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I said, "Yes, I believe that also."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He asked, "Are you saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I said, "I don't know."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then he said to me strongly, "But God said this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you don't believe what He says, you make Him a liar!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These words lifted the veil from my heart and quickened my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Immediately, I sensed the anointing within and fully believed that I was saved.</S>
