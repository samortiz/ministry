   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Spirit of Sonship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For you have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How did we receive this spirit of sonship?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the Spirit of the Son of God coming into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Galatians 4:6, a sister verse to Romans 8:15, says, And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 8:15 says that we have received a spirit of sonship ; Galatians 4:6 says that God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the Spirit of the Son of God enters into our spirit our spirit becomes a spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, verse 15 says that we have received a spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, verse 15 mentions a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father ; but in Galatians 4:6 it says that the Spirit of His Son cries Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, whether we cry or He cries, we both cry together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we cry, He cries in our crying.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He cries, we cry with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to grammar, the subject of crying in verse 15 is we, but in Galatians 4:6 the subject of crying is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These two verses prove that we and He, our spirit and the Spirit, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we cry, Abba, Father, He joins with us in our crying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit cries in our crying because the Spirit of the Son of God indwells our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, there is no fear, only a sweet crying of, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abba is an Aramaic word which also means father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When these two terms Abba and Father are put together, the result is a deep, sweet sense, a sense that is exquisitely intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Abba, Father is sweetness intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Children of every race address their father in such a sweet way: in America we say, Daddy ; in China they say, Baba ; and in the Philippines they say, Papa.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not speak one syllable, such as Da, Ba, or Pa. It is not sweet at all if we speak just one syllable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to say, Daddy, Baba, or Papa.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to call, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you do it, you will realize how sweet it is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why do we call, Abba, Father ?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we have a spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a certain man is not my father, it will be difficult for me to call him Daddy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It may be easy for me to call him mister, but I cannot call him Daddy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would be even harder for me to say to him, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In fact, it would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If my dear father were still living, I would like to call him, Daddy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It would be so sweet to address him in this way because I was born of him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Young people, there is no need for you to doubt whether or not you are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you say, Abba, Father, do you have a sweet, intimate sensation within you?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you do, it proves that you are a son of God and that you have a spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you find yourself able to call Him God, but not Abba Father, it indicates that you are not a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, as long as you can call, Abba, Father sweetly, you may be assured that you are a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>B. The Witnessing of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 14 we see the sons of God and in verse 15 the spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why in verse 16 does Paul suddenly mention the children ?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because the Spirit witnesses to something basic.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He witnesses to our primary or initial relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As I have already mentioned, we may be children without the growth of a son and we may be sons without the qualification of an heir.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For the Holy Spirit to witness that we are all heirs of God would be premature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Most of us are not mature enough for such a witness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, the Spirit witnesses to the most basic and elementary relationship that of being the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He witnesses with our spirit that we are God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the witnessing of the Holy Spirit starts with the youngest age, even from our spiritual birth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Regardless of how young or new you may be, if you are a child of God, the Spirit of God witnesses with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Notice that it does not say in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If it said in our spirit, it would mean that only the Spirit of God witnesses, but that our spirit does not witness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, it says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, meaning that both witness together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Spirit of God witnesses, and simultaneously our spirit witnesses together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some may say, I don t feel that the Spirit of God witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Where is the Spirit of God?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I don t feel Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I don t have any sensation that the Spirit of God is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I never saw Him and I cannot feel Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I simply cannot sense Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, do you not feel that your spirit witnesses?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You must realize that as long as your spirit is witnessing it means that the Holy Spirit also is witnessing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You cannot deny that your spirit witnesses within you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Apostle Paul was very wise.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He said that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When our spirit witnesses, that is also the witnessing of the Spirit, because the two spirits have been mingled together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is very difficult for anyone to distinguish these two spirits.</S>
