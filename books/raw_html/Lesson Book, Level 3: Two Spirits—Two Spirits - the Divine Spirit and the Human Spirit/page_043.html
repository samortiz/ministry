<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Spirit Within and the Word Outside</H2><P>In the last lesson we pointed out that in order to preach the gospel effectively we must gain a rich deposit from the Word. Now we see more clearly why this is so crucial. We surely need the Spirit's empowering, but it is the Word that we must preach.</P><P>[We have the Holy Spirit in our spirit, and we have the Holy Word, the Bible, in our hands. These should not be two things, but two ends of one thing. The end within us is the Spirit; the end outside of us is the Word. When the Word enters our spirit it becomes the Spirit, and when the Spirit is expressed from our mouth it becomes the Word.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE DAILY NEED TO TOUCH<br>THE SPIRIT IN THE WORD</H2><P>Our need, then, is to spend time every day to touch the Spirit in the Word. Even if we take as little as ten minutes to pray-read a portion of the Word, we shall receive nourishment. At the very least, we should do this every morning. The morning is the best time. Before you go to school, before you do anything, pray to touch the Lord, apply His precious blood, and open the Bible to receive the Spirit through the Word.</P><P>[As saved and regenerated ones, we have the Spirit of God in our spirit. Thus, when we exercise our spirit in pray-reading the Word, we apply the Word to us and mingle the Word and the Spirit. Immediately, we receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit.]</P><P>Praise the Lord! The all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified Spirit is embodied in the Word! Eventually you will find that ten minutes is too short a time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>The Spirit is rather abstract and mysterious, but the Word of God is concrete and in our hands. The Lord Jesus is both the Spirit and the Word. Without taking the Word, we cannot have the Spirit, because the Spirit is embodied in the Word. If we would receive the Spirit through the Word, we must take the Word by exercising our spirit. Although the Spirit is our power for preaching, the Word is what we must preach. Every day we need to open the Bible to receive the Spirit through the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Describe the two extremes concerning the Spirit among Christians. What is the proper balance?</li><li>What do we mean when we say that the Spirit is embodied in the Word?</li><li>Give three portions of Scripture that indicate that the Spirit and the Word are one. Briefly explain each portion.</li><li>Why is it so important that we exercise our spirit when we read the Bible?</li><li>How does the book of Acts show us that the Word is something living?</li><li>Why do we need both the Spirit and the Word for our gospel preaching?</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Life-study of Philippians, p. 338.</li><li>Life-study of Ephesians, pp. 548-549.</li><li>Life-study of Philippians, p. 362.</li><li>Fellowship Concerning the Lord's Up-to-Date Move, Elders' Training, Book 5, pp. 41-42.</li><li>Life-study of Philippians, p. 309.</li><li>Life-study of John, p. 200.</li><li>Life-study of Philippians, p. 307.</li><li>The Stream, Vol. 5, No. 2, May 1, 1967, p. 9.</li><li>Christ Versus Religion, pp. 106-107.</li><li>Life-study of Philippians, pp. 319, 399.</li><li>Fellowship Concerning the Lord's Up-to-Date Move, Elders' Training, Book 5, pp. 38-39.</li><li>Christ Versus Religion, p. 104.</li><li>Life-study of Philippians, pp. 310-311.</li></ol>
