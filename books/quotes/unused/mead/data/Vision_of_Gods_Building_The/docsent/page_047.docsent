   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE STRUGGLE OVER GOD'S BUILDING AND FURTHER ENLARGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From the six Old Testament books of 1 and 2 Samuel through 1 and 2 Chronicles we see another principle God's building always involves a struggle, a real battle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When God has done something, the enemy always attempts to damage and destroy God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The pleasant prospect, the glorious condition, never lasts too long; that is, not until we reach the ultimate goal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During this process of time, over the ages, there is a continuous struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Satan will not allow the good prospect of God's building to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>History shows how God's enemy came in to damage and desolate God's temple not long after it was finished 2 Chron 12:1-2; 24:4-5, 7, 12-13; 29:2-7, 16-17; 34:8, 10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only did he damage the temple, but eventually Satan sent the Chaldeans, the Babylonians, to completely destroy God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They took away all the vessels of the temple and then burned God's house 2 Chron 36:17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The city out of which Abraham was called was in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of Revelation reveals that up to the very last age before God's ultimate consummation these two cities will be in existence, Jerusalem and Babylon; and Babylon is always in opposition to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Abraham was separated from Babylon, and his descendants eventually built God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But God's enemy came also from Babylon to destroy this building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The destruction inflicted upon Jerusalem by the Babylonians was not perpetrated merely by human hands, but by the enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, had captured all the vessels related to the temple and the worship of God and brought them to Babylon, where he put them in a temple of idols Ezra 1:7; Dan 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was a great blasphemy to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus it is evident that this fight was not merely between the Babylonians and the Jewish people, but between Satan and God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GOD'S INTENTION FOR THIS EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must remember that God's intention is to recover this earth from His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through His chosen people, especially through men like David and Solomon, God regained at least a portion of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He recovered some ground upon which He could place His feet, where He could glorify Himself, express Himself, and exercise His authority upon this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is in this way that God becomes the Lord, not only of the heavens, but also of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because God had gained a place on this earth through His people, He could be called the Lord of earth as well as the Lord of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, God is eager to recover the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Satan sent the army of Babylon to destroy the temple, that meant, spiritually speaking, that he came to force God out of His position on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By reading all the books of the captivity, such as Ezra, Nehemiah, and Daniel, we notice a very interesting fact: in all of these books God is always called "the God of heaven," not the God of heaven and earth Ezra 1:2; 7:12, 21, 23; Neh 1:4, 5; 2:4; Dan 2:18, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In a sense, God had been chased away from this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God had lost the ground to exercise His authority on this earth, for it had been captured by His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The temple was destroyed, the ground was lost, and God withdrew from earth to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God again became the God of heaven, rather than the God of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Satan's intention is ever to chase God from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's intention is to have a building on the earth, a Bethel, a gate to heaven, a place where God can put His feet to exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must see from history that whenever there is a person or a group of persons on this earth who will take a stand for God, at that time God is called the God of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Genesis, when Abraham defeated the five kings, Melchisedek the priest came out to meet him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time God was called the "possessor of heaven and earth" Gen 14:19 , because at that time there was at least one person on this earth who could be the gate of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Abraham brought heaven down to this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God could boast because of Abraham that He was the possessor not only of the heavens, but also of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He had some ground upon which to exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later in history, when the people of Israel crossed the Jordan, the priests who carried the ark stepped into the waters and remained there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time, God was called "the Lord of all the earth" Josh 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There were some people on this earth standing with God, and through these people God gained the position to exercise His authority on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, in all the later books which record Israel's captivity, God is always called the God of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Apparently speaking, God had been chased away from this earth by the failure of His people.</S>
