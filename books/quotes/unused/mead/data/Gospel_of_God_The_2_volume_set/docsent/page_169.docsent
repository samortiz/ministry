   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REGENERATION AND ETERNAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third point that we need to consider is the salvation that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What has God done for us, and what has He given us?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all know that God has given us His life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All those who believe in Him and who receive Him are given the authority to become children of God John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are begotten of God, and we have the authority to become His children vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 3 says that we are to be born anew; it is the Holy Spirit who has regenerated us v. 6 . The first Epistle of John tells us how man can be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First John 5:1 says that everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How are we regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are regenerated through believing in Jesus as the Christ whom God appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After reading the above three verses, we can realize who we, as Christians, are.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a sinner believes in the Lord Jesus and is saved, God gives him a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible shows us in at least three or four places that being regenerated is to receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible repeatedly shows us that those who receive eternal life are the ones who have believed, and those who believe have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is shown to us repeatedly by the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has given to us eternal life, but what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must realize that this is both the beginning and the end. If I do not desire to have a relationship with someone, I have to approach it in one of two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since human relationships are bilateral, they always have two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, not having a relationship also involves two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, there must not be a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If there is not a beginning, there will not even be a relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, the relationship can terminate and die, in which case there will no longer be a relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, suppose I am a very bad son, a prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are two ways for my father not to have a relationship with me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, he should not have begotten me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there had not been a beginning, he would not have to be related to me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if there has been a beginning, he cannot use the first way anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this case, he can only wait day by day for me to die.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I die, my relationship with him will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I am not born of him, I will have nothing to do with him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I have died, I will also have nothing to do with him anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What happened between God and us?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the time that we believed in Jesus, God begat us with His Spirit and with His own life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have become the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Can this relationship be severed?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you have a son today who is bad, undisciplined, and lawless, you can disown him in court.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the fact that you have begotten him still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is still your son in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today God has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Can He say that He has not begotten us?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even if we become worse than we are, we are still begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if our father denies us, we are still begotten of him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one can deny the fact of begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A good son is begotten of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A bad son is also begotten of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one can nullify this relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, when God justified us, He did not do it in the way that a person sends people away on the street with two pennies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He said that He has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God is in Spirit, and we are also in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God and we have a father-son relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is what God Himself has said.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has given us authority to become children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He has given to us eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are children of God by authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That is the beginning.</S>
