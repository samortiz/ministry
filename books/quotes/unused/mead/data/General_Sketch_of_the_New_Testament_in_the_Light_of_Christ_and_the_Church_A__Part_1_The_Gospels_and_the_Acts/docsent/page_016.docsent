   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE SEVEN MAIN ITEMS IN THE GOSPELS 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will once again review the general subject of the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we saw in the previous chapters, we may express this subject in four terms: a universal man with Christ as the Head and the church as His Body, the history of this universal man, the definition and explanation of the universal man, and the consummation of the universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These four items give us a full picture of the New Testament in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition, we saw that the Old Testament is composed mainly of types and prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Two central matters, Christ and the church, are the fulfillment of all the types and prophecies of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPHECIES CONCERNING CHRIST AND THE CHURCH Christ Prophesied in Persons, Times, and Places</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The real significance of the prophecies concerning Christ is the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This divine One, Christ, intends to mingle Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the proper insight into the persons, times, and places in all the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Related to the Lord's person, for example, Christ is called Immanuel Isa 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this one wonderful name, there is God and man, a man filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Isaiah 9:6 also tells us that a child is born, yet His name is called Mighty God, and a son is given, yet His name is called Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All of these names related to persons show us this wonderful One who is God Himself mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then, in the matter of time, Christ came forth in time, yet His goings forth are from ancient times, from the days of eternity Micah 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His goings forth are from eternity, yet His appearing is in time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here again is the principle of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only God Himself is in eternity, and the creatures of God are in time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The eternal Creator had the intention to mingle Himself with His creatures in time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Related to places, Christ came out of Judea, yet He came from an eternal place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of these Old Testament prophecies give us a picture of God's intention to mingle Himself with the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This insight into the real meaning of prophecies has been nearly lost in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many Christian teachers speak about these prophecies, but they do not grasp the central insight into them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The central insight into the prophecies is that God's intention is to come into man and mingle Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Church as the Bride, the Brothers, and the Children</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Old Testament prophecies also speak concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The type of Adam and Eve signifies that the church as the bride of Christ is a part of Christ Gen 2:22-24; Eph 5:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A wife is the counterpart of the husband, and the husband and wife joined together are a perfect whole.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have the spiritual insight, we can realize that a man or woman alone is only one half.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A woman must match a man by marrying him; then the two will be one whole.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may illustrate a man and a woman by a watermelon.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we cut a watermelon in half, there are two parts, each having a round side and a flat side.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we match the two flat sides together, the melon is whole.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same way, the husband is a part to the wife, and the wife is a counterpart to the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The two must match each other to make a perfect whole.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A whole man is not a man alone; it is a man with his counterpart, his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This reveals a deep truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In numbering people, both the Old Testament and the New Testament often do not reckon the females Num 1:2; John 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is because the female is the counterpart of the male.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through all the generations and around the globe, a bride always covers her head during the wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In every kind of wedding, whether in China, Indonesia, or India, the bride's head is covered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this way, at a wedding there are two persons but only one head.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the bride marries a bridegroom, she takes him as her head and covers her own head.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then from the wedding day on, these two become one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a picture of the church's relationship to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is Christ's counterpart to match Christ, to be a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, Ephesians 5:31 says, "A man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that the church is a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church is also revealed as the many brothers of Christ as His multiplication Psa 22:22; John 20:17; Heb 2:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Originally Christ was the only begotten Son of God John 1:18 , but in resurrection He became the Firstborn among many brothers Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The one grain became many grains John 12:24 as the duplication and multiplication of the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way, the church is the multiplication of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, the church is prophesied as the many children given to Christ Isa 8:18; Heb 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church has the same life and nature as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ is the very source of the church, and the church is born of this source.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In summary, the church as the bride of Christ is a part of Christ, the church as the many brothers of Christ is Christ's multiplication and duplication, and the church as the children given to Christ has the same life and nature as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This insight into the church helps us to thoroughly understand what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We do not need to say much; just by these three aspects we can have a clear understanding of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church is a part of Christ and the multiplication of Christ, having the same life and nature as Christ.</S>
