<h1 class="title">THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY AMONG THE BRETHREN</h2>
<p>In the nineteenth century the brothers of the so-called Brethren assemblies were raised up. This was one of God&rsquo;s great recoveries in the history of the church. This recovery was exceedingly strong and very rich. The following items were recovered through the Brethren.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Absolutely Forsaking the World</h2>
<p>It is rare in church history to see a group break its ties with the world as cleanly as the Brethren did. They were much more advanced than the Moravian Brethren. The Moravian Brethren broke their ties with politics and religious organization; the Brethren not only forsook politics and religious organization but also the world. They did this in an absolutely clean way.</p>
<p>Even today there are some among the Brethren who have never had their picture taken so that they will not leave any pictures behind for people to see. Furthermore, it is difficult to find a proper biography of John Nelson Darby because he did not allow people to write his biography or publicize what he did. Some of the Brethren were titled nobility, but they wrote respectful letters to the English monarch renouncing their titles. The pitiful situation today is that some who do not have a doctorate still seek to have a degree. Some of today&rsquo;s preachers have never attended a university, yet they advertise themselves as Dr. So-and-so. The Brethren rejected all such worldly things; they were freed from them. In all of church history they were the most thorough in forsaking the world. This was not merely a form; they were not only separated from the world but actually forsook it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Brotherly Love</h2>
<p>Next, the Brethren recovered the reality of brotherly love. If we were to compare our situation today with their situation one hundred years ago, we would be far behind them. They had the reality of the brotherly love in Philadelphia.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Practical Living</h2>
<p>Moreover, probably no other group of Christians in church history has matched the Brethren in the matter of practical living before the Lord. The practical living of the Brethren included their families. Some have said that the best Christian families in the whole world were those of the Brethren. This recovery of practical Christian living was high, great, and strong.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Truth</h2>
<p>Another particular recovery among the Brethren was the recovery of the truth. Most Christians acknowledge that the recovery of truth and revelation among the Brethren surpassed everything before it; Darby is considered the king of Bible exposition. The proper truths taught in Protestantism today are nearly one hundred percent from the truths recovered by the Brethren. Although their knowledge of a few truths concerning overcoming was incomplete, their knowledge of most truths was very proper. All the orthodox things taught in Protestantism today have been influenced by the teachings of the Brethren. Moody said that if all the books in the entire world were burned, he would be satisfied to have a copy of the Bible and a copy of <em>Notes on the Pentateuch</em> by the Brethren writer C. H. Mackintosh.</p>
<p>The Scofield Reference Bible is popular among Christians today; it is a reference Bible that many preachers cannot do without. Christians are also familiar with Scofield&rsquo;s Bible correspondence course. Nearly ninety percent of what Scofield wrote in these two publications was adopted from Brethren teaching. Thus, Scofield was not an original writer; he passed on material taught by the Brethren, which he collected and edited. Many basic truths&mdash;concerning things such as the church, the Lord&rsquo;s return, prophecies, and the separation between the church and the world&mdash;were recovered at that time. The recovery of these things was bright and clear. Luther recovered the truth of justification by faith, but he did not expound it clearly enough; the Brethren thoroughly expounded the truth of justification by faith.</p>
<p>J. N. Darby, one of the Brethren, wrote #47 in <em>Hymns.</em> It is difficult to find a similar hymn of such quality. The first two stanzas say, &ldquo;Father, Thy name our souls would bless, / As children taught by grace, / Lift up our hearts in righteousness, / And joy before Thy face. / Sweet is the confidence Thou giv&rsquo;st, / Though high above our praise; / Our hearts resort to where Thou liv&rsquo;st / In heaven&rsquo;s unclouded rays.&rdquo; The truth in this hymn is truly high, deep, and penetrating. We must note here that when Brother Watchman Nee translated this hymn into Chinese, he improved upon the original English. Although the hymn was already very good, it was not so clear in its meaning. After passing through Brother Nee&rsquo;s translation, it is clearer.</p>
<p>Darby also wrote #127 in our hymnal. The first stanza says, &ldquo;Hark! ten thousand voices crying, / &lsquo;Lamb of God!&rsquo; with one accord; / Thousand thousand saints replying, / Wake at once the echo&rsquo;ng chord.&rdquo; This hymn is excellent; it is difficult to find another person who could write a hymn in which the truth is so clear and accurate, the meaning so profound and great, and the quality so substantial and outstanding. This was a great recovery.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Brethren also expounded the meaning of justification and sanctification. Before the Brethren were raised up, many people thought they were clear in their knowledge of the truth, but they were actually confused. Only after the Brethren were raised up was the truth clearly defined. More than ninety-five percent of the work to cut straight of the word of the truth (2 Tim. 2:15) was accomplished by the Brethren. We must give them credit. Although people may condemn them today, we still must mention their strong points. The value of the Brethren will not be measured until eternity; only then will we be able to express what practical benefit they were to the church.</p>
<p>Our intention is not to praise the Brethren but to worship God. Luther brought the Bible out of the Roman Catholic Church and made it public, but he did not expound it. The Bible was not expounded until the time of the Brethren. In their hands the truth was recovered in a great and strong way. To this day Darby&rsquo;s five-volume <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em> has not been excelled. The thought in the <em>Synopsis</em> is deep; Darby&rsquo;s view is broad, and his knowledge of the Bible is something few have attained. A believer, earnestly pursuing the truth, would still have to study this work for ten years in order to understand it. This set of books has a value and position to which other books cannot compare, so it is no wonder that people honor Darby.</p>
<p>If someone reads and understands the <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible,</em> he will see that in Darby&rsquo;s hands, the Bible is very clear from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22. Darby was not perfect; it is not possible for any man to be perfect. However, the <em>Synopsis</em> is something from the Lord. Darby was fluent in five languages&mdash;English, French, German, Greek, and Hebrew. His Greek and Hebrew were excellent, enabling him to translate the Bible into English, French, and German. I have heard that the French and German versions are his best translations.</p>
<p>In addition to translating the Bible into English, French, and German, Darby also wrote many books. It is difficult to say how he found the time to produce so many precious books. It would be very difficult for an ordinary person, who lived to the age of eighty, to write so many things. Brother Nee said that if Darby had not become a servant of the Lord, he would have been famous in the world because he had a great soul. The truths he recovered are excellent, with a proper view and much light. We thank God for these truths because we have received much help from them. I believe that all those living before God today with a proper knowledge of the Bible have been helped by the Brethren. Even those who oppose the Brethren have received help from them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> </body></html>
