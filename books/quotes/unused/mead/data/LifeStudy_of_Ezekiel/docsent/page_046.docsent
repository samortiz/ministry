   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT BEING HUMAN AND NATURAL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BUT BEING THE THRONE ABOVE THE CLEAR SKY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not talk about authority in a human, natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the church there is no human authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The authority in the church is the throne above the clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose the leading brothers or the elders in a local church are not under a clear sky, yet they exercise authority based on their position.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of exercise of authority does not work because it has no weight and no ruling; there is no throne in a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, suppose the leading ones and the elders are continually under a clear sky, having a conscience that is pure and void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If this is their situation, they will be under the heavenly throne, and with them there will be something weighty and something of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, there will be no need for them to claim authority over the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To claim authority over the saints indicates that one does not have any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as we are under a clear sky with a throne above it, there is no need for us to claim to have authority the authority is simply there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should never try to bring others under our authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such a thing is a hierarchy; it is something of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not try to rule over the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, we should humble ourselves and remain under the throne in the clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is shameful for anyone to claim to be the authority in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no such thing!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the church there is no human authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave Matt 20:25-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Matthew 23:11 He said, The greatest among you shall be your servant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the way to have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The authority is not mine nor yours nor others .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The only authority is the throne above a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I can assure you that if we are under a clear sky with the throne above it, the genuine authority will be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No opposition or persecution will be able to defeat us or shake us because heaven and the throne are with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the sky above us is clear and the throne is with us, we will have the authority and the weight.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The weight of a person before God is equal to the degree of that person s subjection to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A particular brother may be quite proper in his speaking and behavior, but he is light as a feather, altogether lacking in spiritual weight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that he is not subject to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, the situation with another brother may be very different.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you contact him, you sense that he is weighty and you respect him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This brother is weighty because he has learned to subject Himself to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we submit to the throne, the weightier we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let me tell you about the experience of a female missionary in China.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As one who preached strongly concerning regeneration, she was under God s authority and thereby was a person with authority and weight in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day a boat on which she was traveling was seized by pirates, who retained control of the vessel for several days.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As they searched her room for money and jewels, she sat there calmly, without any fear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She told the leader of the pirates that it was too hot to confine the passengers to their rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She also told him that he should be responsible for cleaning the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The leader of the pirates obeyed her and told his men to clean the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A ferocious pirate leader came under the authority of this missionary because she herself was under the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She subjected herself to God s authority; therefore, God s authority was with her.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to realize that the amount of weight we have depends on our subjection to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The words out of one brother s mouth may have weight and power, but the same words out of another brother s mouth may have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The reason is that one brother is under a clear sky with the throne, but the other is under a dark, cloudy sky without the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is easy to learn to repeat or quote others words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But whether the words that issue out of our mouth have weight or amount to nothing depends on whether or not we are under a clear sky with the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The proper Christian life and the proper church life is a life under the throne that is above a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I would remind all the dear ones who bear responsibility in the local churches never to exercise their authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to realize that none of us has any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The authority is the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Consider the situation with Moses in the book of Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the people of Israel rebelled against him, he did not exercise his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Instead, Moses and Aaron bowed down and called upon the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then the Lord came in to vindicate Num 14:5; 16:1-4, 22; 20:2-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is a serious mistake to exercise authority over others in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nothing is more shameful than this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To exercise authority over the saints is not glorious it is shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>None of us is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The authority is the man on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must have the man on the throne in our clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the church life we need a clear sky with a heavenly throne.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord needs such a church today.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He needs a group of coordinated living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>While they are standing or walking on earth, the heavens are opened to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Through them the heavenly throne is transmitted to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do not take the natural, human way to exercise any kind of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even if others come to you trying to recognize you as an authority, you must refuse it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You need to tell these ones that you are not the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not what authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Proper authority is a matter of a throne above the clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is absolutely not a human matter of organization and hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to have a clear sky with a throne.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is shameful to have power among the saints, to be the authority among the saints, or to intend that the saints should listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We always consider Paul a great apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But his name means little, and he regarded himself as less than the least of the saints Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Paul might say, You give me too great a title.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I am not worthy of that.</S>
