   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen God's authority manifested in various institutions first, in human government, second, in the family, and third, in ordinary relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a fourth place where His authority is ordained in the supernatural world, the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seems as if we are conducting a Bible study this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The above four considerations show us clearly what authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The best example of submission to authority in the Bible can be found in the account of Michael's dispute with the devil over Moses' body as recorded in Jude 9.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Michael was one of the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was an angel who was given dominion over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God made him one of the archangels; yet at one time, he was Satan's subordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was Michael's specific responsibility to contend for God's interest, but he was once a subject of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He disputed with Satan over Moses' body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Moses died, God probably entrusted his body to Michael for burial.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the principle of 2 Corinthians 5, Moses must have resurrected on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Michael probably was moving Moses' body to that mountain when Satan stopped him and argued with him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Michael was in a difficult position.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He had God's order to bring Moses' body to the Mount of Transfiguration, yet Satan, who was once over him, would not let him do it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In reading Jude 9, we find that Michael "did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him but said, The Lord rebuke you."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Michael could not rebuke Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He could only say, "The Lord rebuke you," because the Lord's authority was higher than that of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a pattern of how we should submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Michael did not dare to rebuke Satan because Satan was above him in God's original ordination, not because he was afraid or powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here is a lesson for Christians to learn; we should learn from Michael's submission.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He only said, "The Lord rebuke you."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He invoked a higher authority to rebuke Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He dared not rebuke Satan directly because he did not want to upset the order in the divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If our eyes are blind to the way God upholds His authority, nothing more can be said.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if our eyes are opened to this matter, we will realize that God will sacrifice anything but His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unlike Michael, we are the new creation, and we do not have to be under Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has never entrusted man to Satan, but we still should learn the principle of submission from Michael.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Michael would not rebuke Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He only said, "The Lord rebuke you."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who have this kind of attitude know God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The book of Jude teaches us to submit to God's authority in this kind of way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>MEETING AUTHORITY IN THE SYSTEMS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>ESTABLISHED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every one of us has to touch authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Otherwise, we run into problems.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a man touches authority, all of his problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we realize that all systems of authority are established by God, we have nothing more to say.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some people do not want to submit to their masters, their parents, or their brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some wives do not want to submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some people excuse their disobedience by saying that their masters are too poor or that their husbands or brothers are not worthy of their submission.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some children, who have graduated from universities, think that their parents are too old-fashioned.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They think they know more than their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This becomes an excuse for not obeying their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people have problems with other men.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we look around, we will find that many people are asking these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everyone who has not touched authority has these kinds of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some wives despise their husbands; they even fight with their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some children disobey their parents and argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some servants ignore or argue with their masters when they cannot submit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some ignore the law when they face corrupt officers or unjust legislation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But whether or not our husband, our parents, or our representatives in the government are evil is none of our business.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have touched authority, we will not criticize them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The whole issue rests on whether or not we have touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once we have touched authority, these problems are no longer problems.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a person sees only men, he cannot be of any use to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to realize that the systems of authority established among human society are established and ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once we touch God and His authority, all problems go away.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yesterday we quoted some examples from the Old Testament to illustrate the matter of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even though Moses was wrong when he married the Cushite woman, his sister and brother should not have reviled him rashly because he was God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A deputy authority may be wrong, but it is not our business to criticize him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our business is to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whether or not masters, husbands, parents, and those in authority have a problem in themselves is not our concern.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to know only one thing: If we do not submit to them, we have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A person who tries to confront God's deputy authority always runs into problems.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We may think that our master or our husband is not as good as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This thought exists because we have touched these people only.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we only touch people, we encounter problems.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But if we touch authority, we will not have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some servants only touch their masters.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some children only touch their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some only touch their brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These ones do not have a way to go on because they are only touching men; they have not touched authority and are not willing to yield.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A person is useless if he continues to criticize the government, those in authority, parents, superiors, or elders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All of his spiritual power will leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is taking the way of Satan and acting according to his principle.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>MAINTAINING THE DIVINE SYSTEM OF AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Since the beginning of the world, God has been ruling and upholding the entire universe with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Both man's fall and the fall of the universe had their source in rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rebellion has thrown off authority.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we do not deal with this basic issue, we will be useless no matter where we go.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We will be unable to work in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We cannot preach the gospel of Christ and perform God's work or service while taking Satan's way and maintaining his principle.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Once we touch and apprehend God's authority, we will know that God created and maintains the universe by His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He has placed His system of authority in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have to uphold the system God has ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have to learn to submit to men and not to touch authority in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In all these relationships we have to learn to know authority and practice obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We have to know that there are lords and masters in everything; we cannot assume to be the master as soon as we touch something.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have to learn obedience through many situations.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>One finds authority in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As soon as he works in a hospital, he has to obey the authority in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There is even authority in a restaurant.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Some serve as managers, and we have to learn to obey them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we touch authority in a genuine way, we will find authority wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In obeying the authority of earthly institutions, we are actually obeying God because all authorities are from God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We have to see that every authority is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Only a rebellious and proud man is blind to authority; only he will not submit to God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we cannot submit to His deputy authority, or if we say that we do not sense God's authority on earth today, we are not qualified to touch God's work; we cannot work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>During the past three days, I have stressed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I feel that my utterance is still short.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Within myself I know what authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Brothers and sisters, we have to ask for mercy to see authority.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Our inner being has to be so fine that we will feel what Michael felt when he faced Satan's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The church on earth bears the testimony of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If the church does not submit, what will it be like?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We have to learn to obey when placed under all kinds of circumstances and systems.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We should never consider one who rebels and offends authority as a hero.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>A rebellious person is never a hero.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If all the sons of God would stand on the ground of submission, the activities of the lawless ones would be suppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Second Thessalonians says that the mystery of lawlessness is now operating, but there is one who is now restraining 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Who is this restraining one?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He is not a nominal Christian or a rebellious Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Our obedience is what prevents the mystery of Satan's lawlessness from operating.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is a fundamental issue.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If this issue is not resolved, no work can follow, because we will still be Satan's men.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we see God's authority in all human institutions.</S>
