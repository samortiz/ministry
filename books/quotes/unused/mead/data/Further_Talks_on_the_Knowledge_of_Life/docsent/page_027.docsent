   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN FOLLOWING THE INNER SENSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When God created man in the beginning, he saw that man was good Gen 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that in God s eyes, the created human life is good.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before a person is saved, he has this created goodness, and all his senses derive from this goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, this created goodness was corrupted and defiled because of man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consequently, the most that this defiled and damaged goodness can provide is a consciousness of good in the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, a saved person, a normal Christian, in contrast to an unbeliever, has an additional sense the divine sense of God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>MAN S INNER SENSE Limiting and Restricting Man</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man s inner sense is used by God to limit, restrict, and restrain man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A person sins because he suppresses his inner sense Rom 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a person suppresses this inner sense, he is capable of committing many sins vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>28-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not the policeman who restrains and limits us but rather our inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first thing that checks and limits our behavior is our inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Believer s Inner Sense Being Stronger</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Than an Unbeliever s Inner Sense</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some may ask, Who has a stronger inner sense, a good person or an evil person?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The better a person is, the stronger his inner sense will be, and the more evil a person is, the weaker his inner sense will be.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because a person must constantly suppress his inner sense in order to do evil things; thus, his inner sense becomes weaker and weaker.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may also ask if this applies to believers and unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christians have a stronger inner sense because the uncreated, divine life of God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This life gives us a sense which is much stronger than the sense that is derived only from our created goodness, which is all that an unbeliever can sense.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, it is easier for an unbeliever to commit sin than it is for a believer, because within a believer there is a strong sense to resist sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This sense is the sense from God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>An unbeliever has a sense of conscience, which is the sense of our created goodness; in contrast, a believer not only has a sense of conscience but also a sense of God s life, which causes him to have a stronger inner sense than an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, an unbeliever merely needs to overcome this weaker inner sense of conscience in order to sin; in contrast, a Christian must exert considerable effort to resist and suppress the strong inner sense that comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has put a sense within man to serve as a brake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are driving a car, we step on the brakes to prevent an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The most important part of a car is the brakes; they must be sturdy and effective.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The brakes of a good car will bring a car to an immediate stop in an emergency.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if a car is traveling at a high speed, as soon as a driver steps on the brakes, the car will quickly come to a halt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to prevent a car from getting into danger or deviating from the road, a car must have good brakes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our inner sense is the brake of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The created inner sense, the brake, within an unbeliever is weaker in comparison to the sense of God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, with the damage caused by Satan, the defilement of sin, and the corruption of the world, this brake has been greatly weakened and is even less effective.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, it is easier for an unbeliever to get into trouble, commit sin, and do evil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With only a little resistance, this inner sense can be annulled and overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The inner sense of life within Christians, however, is strong, or we may say, our brake is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consequently, a great amount of effort is required to resist it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After an unbeliever commits a sin, the inner feeling of condemnation can be light; however, after a Christian commits a sin, the inner feeling of condemnation is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, all God s children should learn to take heed to the inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man s inner sense of life is indeed a great thing; the stronger the inner sense of life, the more operative it will be.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not know how to use the brake, that is, how to exercise and care for the inner sense of life, we will be like a driver who does not know how to use his brakes, which is extremely dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The safety of a motorcycle or a car depends on whether a driver uses his brakes in an appropriate manner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a person does not know how to use the brakes properly, it is certain that he will eventually have an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Similarly, if we do not take care of and follow the inner sense, it is possible for us to do all kinds of bad things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we should never disregard the inner sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE SOURCE OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>BEING THE LIFE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With regard to the fellowship of life, this fellowship is derived from life; it issues from the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, the source of this fellowship of life is the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First John 1:2 says, We...report to you the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Generally, people use the term preaching, but the apostle John said that he was reporting life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He reported the eternal life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead of preaching, he reported life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we receive the life he reported, we also receive the fellowship of this life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On one hand, this fellowship is with us, referring to the apostles, and on the other hand, it is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ v. 3 .</S>
