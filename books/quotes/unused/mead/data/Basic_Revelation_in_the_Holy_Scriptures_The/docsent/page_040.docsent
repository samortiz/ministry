   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Overcoming and Defeated Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first blue circle of the chart is the church, which is composed of the real Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Within this blue circle is a broken circle also in blue.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This circle signifies the overcoming believers, who are among the churches and belong to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As Christians our color is blue.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are on earth, yet we are heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An American, for example, may be in South Africa, but he is still an American.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is an American in South Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today we are here on earth, but we are not an earthly people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are the heavenly people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has chosen and regenerated millions of people, but not all will go along with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These become the defeated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some who have been regenerated do cooperate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These become the overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among the believers, then, there are two categories, the overcoming and the defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Much of the dispute concerning the rapture is due to the missing of this point.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The overcoming believers will participate in the enjoyment of the millennial kingdom, but the defeated ones will miss the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1 Corinthians 5:1-5 the Apostle Paul deals with a brother who is involved in fornication with his father's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This situation forced the apostle "to deliver such a one to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord" v. 6 . His spirit, Paul said, would still be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a sinful person nonetheless was still a brother, chosen by God and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul commits such a one to Satan to be chastised, yet this person's spirit will still be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord Jesus comes back to set up the kingdom, could such a defeated believer be a king along with the Apostle Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not logical to believe so.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, his spirit will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This case shows that there is a real difference between the overcoming believers and the defeated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Four Categories of People</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Outside the blue circle of the church are two dotted black circles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first one indicates the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This appearance we call Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are genuine Christians and false ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Among the real Christians are the overcoming ones and the defeated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The real and the nominal Christians make up what is termed Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is a difference between Christendom and the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Body of Christ as the genuine church comprises only the true believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The nominal, false believers are not members of Christ's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are in Christendom, but they are not in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The second dotted black circle, underneath "The Appearance of the Kingdom of the Heavens," signifies the world, the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among the nations is Christendom, comprising the real and false believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The genuine Christians are the real members of the Body of Christ, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Among these genuine Christians there are the overcoming ones and the defeated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Among the nations is Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Within Christendom is the church, a composition of the genuine Christians and not including the merely nominal ones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Among the real Christians are the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On this earth today there are these four categories of people the worldly people, the nominal Christians, the real Christians, and the overcoming Christians.</S>
