   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. To Live Christ for His Magnification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being to Participate in Christ's Salvation in Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If Paul had wept in prison about his pitiful situation, that would have been a shame to him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt, he was saved from eternal perdition by Christ, but he still needed to be saved from the shame of not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul's earnest expectation and hope was that he would live Christ for His magnification to participate in Christ's salvation in life Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is to be saved from the failure of not living Christ and to be saved from the defeat of not magnifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If others had seen Paul overwhelmed with sorrow, with anxiety, with sadness, and with despair, that would have been a shame and a defeat to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But instead of this, the Romans saw a person in prison singing, praising, and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is God's dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is God's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If others see you at your office singing and rejoicing happily day by day, they will be surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They will ask you why you are so happy all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may tell them, "This is because I am living and magnifying Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BY THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST A. The Spirit of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19b is not merely the Spirit of God as He was before the resurrection of Christ, but the Spirit of God after passing, along with Christ, through His incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, becoming the processed and consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus in His incarnation, human living, and death Acts 16:7b and the Spirit of Christ in His resurrection Rom 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b and the Spirit, who is particularly unveiled in John 7:38-39 and who becomes the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God to be the aggregate of the consummated Triune God and marry the church, the organic Body of Christ, as the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So at the end, the closing, of the Bible, Revelation 22:17 says, "The Spirit and the bride...."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit is the consummated Triune God, and the bride is the transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They form a couple in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit is also the all-inclusive, compound Spirit compounded with Christ's divinity, His humanity, His death, the effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection, as typified by the anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-28.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a Spirit is eventually the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God's move in the degradation of the church Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. The Bountiful Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The all-inclusive supply, provided with whatever the processed and consummated Triune God, embodied in the all-inclusive Christ and realized in the all-inclusive Spirit, is, has, has accomplished, obtained, attained, and will do, is considered as the unsearchable riches of Christ to meet, in time, the need of the Christ-seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we mean business to seek after Christ, we will receive this bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is by such a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ that the seekers of Christ, as His overcomers in the consummation of this age, live Him for His magnification in the New Testament economy of God for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ as the counterpart of the consummated Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as His eternal enlargement and expression for eternity.</S>
