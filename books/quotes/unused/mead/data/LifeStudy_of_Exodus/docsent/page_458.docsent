   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR THE SIN OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In a foregoing message we pointed out that, according to Exodus 28 and 29, God wants us to invite Him for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we, the hosts, the ones who invite the Lord to dinner, are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, before God can come to have dinner with us, our sinful nature must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the reason Exodus 29 speaks not of the trespass offering, but of the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Are you clear concerning the difference between the sin offering and the trespass offering?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is important to know the difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>SIN AND SINS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the New Testament the word sin is used in two ways, in the singular sin and in the plural sins .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Testament tells us that Christ died on the cross both for our sin and for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 1:29 says, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Corinthians 15:3 Paul says, For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Peter also tells us that Christ died for our sins: Who Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness 1 Pet 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1 Peter 3:18 he goes on to say, Because Christ also has once died concerning sins, the righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter nine of Hebrews speaks of both sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Referring to Christ, verse 26 says, He has been manifested for the putting away of sin by His sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 28 says, So Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those who wait for Him a second time, apart from sin, unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, in the New Testament, there is a distinction between sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sin denotes our fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As fallen ones, our nature is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the sight of God, our nature is actually sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A table made out of wood is not only wooden; it is also wood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In like manner, we are not only sinful we are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need to realize that we are a constitution of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Paul s word in Romans 5:19, we have been constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, sin is related to our sinful nature, to our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sins are a matter of our works, deeds, conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>An infant has a sinful nature from his birth, and as he grows he will therefore commit sins, deeds of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin refers to nature, and sins, to deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Outwardly we have the acts, the deeds, of sin; inwardly we have the nature of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we need a Redeemer, a Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The One who is our Redeemer and Substitute is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He died on the cross for our sins and also for our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As those who would invite God to dinner, we need to confess that we have sinned and that we are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, most of those who are persuaded in a gospel meeting to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ realize only that they are sinful in their deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In my ministry I have never met a person who, at the time of his initial repentance, realized that he was sin, that he was sinful in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we must have this realization if we would invite God for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many Chinese, thinking that Confucius was not wrong in any way, honor him, respect him highly, and regard him as a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But even if Confucius had done nothing wrong outwardly, his nature was still the same as that of a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, a peach tree that bears fruit and a peach tree that does not bear fruit are both the same in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The tree that does not produce peaches is still a peach tree in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, no matter how good Confucius may have been outwardly, he was still a sinner in nature, just like everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thank the Lord that, through His mercy, we love Him and want to invite Him for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when we invite God to come for dinner, we need to realize who we are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some may say, I am a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yes, you are a child of God according to your new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But according to your fallen nature, you are still sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even though today you may not have sinned or done anything wrong, you are still sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, you need to take Christ as your sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to 29:35 and 36, for seven days, every day of the priest s sanctification, a bull as a sin offering was to be offered for propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that daily we must offer Christ to God as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE SIN OFFERING FOR PROPITIATION</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 36 says, And every day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead of propitiation, some versions use the word atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Atonement means at-one-ment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Between us and God there is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This problem is sin, and sin separates us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It keeps us away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But a sacrifice Christ as the sin offering has been offered to God so that we and God may have at-one-ment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to the meaning of the Hebrew word, we may have peace with God because He has been appeased.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As the sin offering, the Lord Jesus has appeased God on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He has reconciled us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As a result, God and we have been brought together in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The bull of the sin offering is not for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rather, it is for propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Nevertheless, perhaps the inward parts and the fat, which were burned on the altar, may be regarded as a kind of food offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I do not presume to say definitely whether these parts of the sin offering were God s food.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, there is no doubt that the inward parts and the fat of the sin offering were burned for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On the one hand, the fat and the inward parts were burned as a sweet savor to God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On the other hand, the blood of the sin offering was poured around the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The sweet savor is for God s satisfaction, and the blood is for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Formerly we had a serious problem with God because of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But a sin offering has been offered to God, and this offering satisfies both God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>By the sweet savor and by the blood both God and we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God is righteous and holy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is also a God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We, by contrast, are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the sight of God we are actually sin.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Furthermore, His righteousness, holiness, and glory automatically place demands on us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But we cannot fulfill these demands, these requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord Jesus has fulfilled God s requirements for us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What He did on the cross satisfied the requirements of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord s death has thus become a sweet savor ascending to God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Whenever God smells this savor, He can say, I am satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Now I am at peace with the one who presents this offering to Me. This is the satisfaction on God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Christ as our sin offering also makes it possible for us to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When we behold the blood of this offering, we are at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Before offering Christ as the sin offering, we did not have any peace.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Instead, we were under condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But through the shedding of the blood of the sin offering and the pouring out of this blood, we are at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Therefore, we can say, O God, thank You that through the blood of the sin offering I am now at peace with You.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As a result, God and we can have fellowship, can talk with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is at-one-ment.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The sin offering is not food in a direct way.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is not food for us at all, and it does not directly provide food for God s eating.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The sin offering is for cleansing, for solving the problem between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We are the ones inviting God to dinner, and God is the One who is invited.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The sin offering solves the problem between the host, the inviter, and God, the invited One.</S>
