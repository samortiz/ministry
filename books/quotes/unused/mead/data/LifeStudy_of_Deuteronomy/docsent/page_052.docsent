   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TURNING AWAY FROM THE DIVISIVE ONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some saints may feel that instead of rejecting the divisive ones, we should receive them and love them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being kindhearted, these saints may say, "Yes, this brother is wrong, and he is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But why should we reject him?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Should we not cover him with love?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the crucial matter here is that we should not tolerate what the Lord does not tolerate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning the divisive ones, we need to consider Paul's word in Romans 16:17.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 14 and 15 indicate that in the matter of receiving the believers Paul is generous, broad-minded, and all-embracing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after greeting so many saints in chapter sixteen, he suddenly gives a word of warning about divisive ones, telling us to keep a watchful eye on them and turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul does not tell us to love these ones or to sympathize with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead of sympathizing with those who make divisions and causes of falling, we are charged by Paul to turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The reason we must turn away from those who cause divisions is that division is extremely serious it destroys the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>APOSTASY AND DIVISION DAMAGING GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we get into the depth of the Word, we will understand why Moses speaks a word concerning apostasy immediately after he gives a charge concerning division.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is very significant that Moses deals with division in Deuteronomy 12 and with apostasy in Deuteronomy 13.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These two matters division and apostasy go together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Apostasy, or heresy, insults God Himself and damages the person of Christ, and division damages God's people as His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that apostasy and division damage the entire economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the apostasy and division are so damaging, they must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We ourselves may not have anything to do with either division or apostasy, but this does not mean there will not be any problem among the saints regarding these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There may be a problem, especially with division.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ones who make divisions are very aggressive in contacting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, they may put on a "mask" and try to entice you by appearing to be nice, humble, and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Certain divisive ones have been practicing this among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose someone comes to you in a "humble" manner, saying, "I would like to have some fellowship with you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have not seen you for a long time, and I miss you very much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How have you been doing?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If someone approaches you in this way, you need to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The apparent kindness, love, and humility of such a person may actually be a mask to hide his divisive intent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to beware of the masks of the divisive ones.</S>
