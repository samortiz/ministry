   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A NEW CREATION IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Apostle Paul was very clear about ordinances, and he knew the futility of debating whether certain practices are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During his time, there was a heated debate about circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt many said that Paul was not scriptural because he discontinued this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Galatians 6:15 Paul uttered a very significant word related to this controversy: For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>. Paul realized that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision had anything to do with God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The only thing that avails as far as God s economy is concerned is a new creation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be a new creation is to have Christ wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Applying this principle to our situation today, we see that the crucial question is not what we do about chair-shaking, tongues-speaking, or pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is altogether a matter of Christ wrought into us and making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As in the time of Paul, the only thing that avails is a new creation in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to recognize the fact that God uses many different ways to bring people to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may criticize the practice of speaking in tongues, but many believers have been helped by this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In like manner, certain saints in Taiwan are helped by shaking chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who are we to condemn them for this or insist that they discontinue this practice?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If certain ones desire to speak in tongues, we should not stop them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The same holds true of pray-reading or of any other practice, as long as it is not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church must be all-inclusive, receiving all genuine believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only in this way can we preserve the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>CHRIST OUR ONLY SOURCE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To see the matter of one city, one church, is good, but it is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not deal with our ordinances, we shall eventually be divided by our opinions or practices.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ should be our only source.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not allow anything of our background or culture to be our source.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, we shall bring in different ordinances according to our various backgrounds and cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ, not our ordinances, is the source of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we did not love the Lord, division would not present such a serious problem, for we would probably all be distracted by worldly endeavors.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But because we love the Lord, we also love the Bible and care for the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, disputes may arise concerning doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such disputes may lead further to division.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In that case, we would repeat the history of divisive Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>RETURNING TO THE GENUINE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Lord s recovery we need to be brought out of every kind of division and return to the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if we see only the ground of oneness but not this matter of the ordinances, our oneness will not be secure.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, we may be in danger of again becoming sectarian or divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may attempt to impose a particular practice on others in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To do this is to have ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church meetings must be general; they must not specialize in certain practices.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If someone desires to speak in tongues, he should be free to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, he should not try to make speaking in tongues the focal point of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our oneness does not consist in practices; it is in Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Insistence on certain practices damages our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should give the saints liberty without insisting on any particular practice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then the oneness will be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as the saints in a locality are for the Lord and are standing on the proper ground of the church, we should be one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead of imposing any practice on them, we should minister the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What we need is to be strengthened into our inner man and filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then instead of trying to adjust others or to correct them, we shall minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Holy Spirit will always honor what is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we supply Christ to others, the Spirit will honor this, and they will be helped.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way we shall practice the church life in a proper way, free from the damage caused by ordinances.</S>
