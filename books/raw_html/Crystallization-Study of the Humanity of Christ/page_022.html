<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Coming in His Humanity<br>to Seek and Save the Lost Sinners</H2><P>Christ as the Son of Man came in His humanity to seek and save the lost sinners (Matt. 18:11; 9:13; Luke 19:10). He ate and drank with the tax collectors and sinners (Matt. 9:10-11; 11:19; Luke 7:34), making friends with them. He visited and lodged with a sinful man, a tax collector named Zaccheus (Luke 19:5-7). He also came as a Physician to the ill (Matt. 9:12), having authority to forgive sins (v. 6). As the Son of Man, Christ came not to destroy men's lives but to save them (Luke 9:56). We need to enjoy Christ as the Son of Man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Having No Place to Lay His Head</H2><P>As the Son of Man, Christ had no place to lay His head (Matt. 8:20; Luke 9:58), not even as the foxes having holes nor as the birds of heaven having roosts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Lord of the Sabbath</H2><P>Christ in His humanity is the Lord of the Sabbath (Matt. 12:8; Mark 2:28; Luke 6:5). As the Son of Man, Christ can forgive people and be the Lord of the Sabbath.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Confessing before His Father<br>in Those Who Confess in Him before Men</H2><P>Christ as the Son of Man will confess in him, before His Father in the heavens and before His angels, everyone who confesses in Him before men, and He will forgive the ones speaking words against Him (Luke 12:8, 10; Matt. 10:32; 12:32).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Sowing Himself into Man</H2><P>The Lord as the Son of Man sowed Himself, in His humanity, as the good seed into man to grow Him (Matt. 13:3-9, 37).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Asking His Disciples<br>Who They Knew Him to Be in His Humanity</H2><P>The Lord Jesus asked His disciples who they knew Him to be in His humanity and guided them to know Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, who will build the church to be the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 16:13-20).</P>
