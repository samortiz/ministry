   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ADVANCE OF TRUTH IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Two great events occurred in the twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first was the Chinese Boxer Rebellion of 1900.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During this rebellion many Christians were martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second event was the great Welsh Revival of 1904.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During this revival many towns saw their whole population saved to such an extent that there were no more souls to save.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many phenomena of Pentecost were manifested among them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The leader of this revival was Evan Roberts, a twenty-two-year-old coal miner.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He had not received much education.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God called such a one from among the lowly and gave him a partner, Hastwell ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>. After he was saved, Roberts often prayed earnestly in the coal mines.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His only prayer was, "Lord, bend the church to save the world."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those around him were both bewildered as well as impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gradually, more people joined him in prayer, and soon the entire mine was affected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many miners rose up to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The revival began to spread to the entire region of southern England.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From them we have learned two truths: first, the revival work of the Holy Spirit is brought in through a group of people who are bent and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not need to ask God to send us an outward revival.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We only need to ask Him to subdue us in a deeper and fresher way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then life will spontaneously flow out from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, from this time on, many began to understand the work of the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before this time, although men talked about this subject, their knowledge of it was not thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Roberts understood what spiritual warfare meant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The experience of Ephesians 6 was not thoroughly apprehended until his time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1908 while he was lying on his sickbed, he told of his experience of warfare with the evil spirits to Mr. and Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Based on this understanding and the latter's personal experience, she wrote the book War on the Saints which helped many deceived believers become free.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During the past few years, almost all of the messages talked about among spiritual believers have been the teachings of Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are truths concerning spiritual warfare and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the same time that this revival was going on, another new work began in Los Angeles in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From 1908 to 1909, a number of black believers on Azusa Street experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Concerning tongue-speaking, it is true that the practice among many is extreme and improper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, we do not nullify altogether the place of tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should help others have this Pentecostal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul's teaching was, on the one hand, that not all speak in tongues 1 Cor 12:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the other hand, he told us, "Do not forbid the speaking in tongues" 14:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first verse is for those who overemphasize this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The second verse is for those who overlook this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should take note of both aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These individuals saw that the prophecy of Joel 2 was only partially fulfilled at the time of the apostles and that the day of the latter rain must come before the complete fulfillment occurs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Spiritually speaking, "the day of the latter rain" refers to today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>GOD'S WORK TODAY AND THE CUMULATIVE REVELATIONS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From the above discussion we can see the different discoveries of God's truths that took place before and during this century.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we need to ask: what is God's work in China today?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What kind of work is God doing today?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Immediately after I was saved, I heard many teachings from the foreign missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Prior to 1920 it was difficult in China even to hear a message on salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After 1920 many messages were preached concerning salvation, justification, and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before that time, many people did not even know about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At present there are over one hundred and fifty different kinds of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God showed us the error of denominationalism and the mistake of sectarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For this reason we began to preach these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Later God began to show us one by one the different truths, that is, the truths that we mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Gradually, we began to see the victory of Christ, the resurrection life, the teaching of the cross, the work of the Holy Spirit, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everywhere in China men began to understand these things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the course of our conversation with the Western missionaries, we discovered that many of these truths were also recovered in the same way in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We know that God's truths are cumulative; later truths do not negate earlier ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the past truths of God form the foundation of the truths today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What we see today are the cumulative revelations of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When God opens our eyes to see this fact, we begin to realize that we are living in the tide of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This tide is a continuation of all the past works of God in previous ages.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From 1926 on, we began to release many messages concerning salvation, the church, and the cross, and we testified much concerning these things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By 1927 we concentrated our attention on the subjective work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We saw that concerning the cross, there is not only the truth concerning Christ's death, but there is also the fact of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the past the resurrection which we preached was mainly a matter of faith; it was not related to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What we speak of today is resurrection as a principle of life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is not just a doctrine but a spiritual fact.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is like a grain of wheat that dies and brings forth many grains; it is the principle of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After this, God showed us what the Body of Christ is and where the reality of this Body is.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We began to realize that as there is only one life of Christ, there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Personally, I received much help from Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In England Mr. Austin-Sparks also received much help from her.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Brother Sparks was a pastor in a Baptist chapel in southeast London.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Later the Lord showed him different truths concerning the meaning of resurrection and the meaning of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We cannot say that the aforementioned truths did not exist before today.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, they have not been revealed as clearly as today.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In spite of this, prior to 1928, we did not mention anything concerning the central matters of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>By February of 1928, we began to mention something concerning God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>From that time on, we began to tell people what God's eternal purpose is.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In that year, we had our first Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Afterward, we had a second Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All of the things mentioned in these conferences were matters related to God's central theme.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Despite the above revelations, it was not until 1934 that we realized that the centrality of everything related to God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Christ is God's centrality and God's universality.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All of God's plan is related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the truth that God is pleased to reveal to us in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is also the message we are preaching during this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is what God showed Brother Sparks also.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He saw much of the truth concerning God's overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God's overcomers are a group of people who take the lead to stand in the place of death on behalf of the whole congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Their relationship with the church is that of Zion's relationship with Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>All of God's requirements fall upon Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When Zion is gained, Jerusalem is gained.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When both Zion and Jerusalem are secured, God's purpose is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Our hearts are full of thanksgiving to God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>From all these brothers we have received much help.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>As Paul said, "Neither did I receive it from man" Gal 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In the same way, we can say that although we have received help from our brothers, these revelations were not received from man.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We received help from Luther, Zinzendorf, the Moravian Brethren, and the Keswick messages.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Today we believe that God's ultimate goal is to have Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>One elderly pastor, Dr. F.B. Meyer, also saw this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>However, by then he was already over ninety years old and could not do much work.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I believe that God has only one work today.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It is the message of Colossians 1:18 which says that God desires to see Christ have the first place in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The basis of everything is the death, the resurrection, and the ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Other than Christ, there is no spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is God's "present truth."</S>
