   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our Experience of God Matching</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Revelation of the Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our experience also shows us that it is impossible to separate the Father from the Son or the Lord from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to 1 Corinthians 12:3, we may contact the Spirit by saying, Jesus is Lord! and according to Galatians 3:14 we may receive the Spirit by believing in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The One who comes into us is the Spirit, yet the One whom we believe in and call upon is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Calling O Lord Jesus also leads us to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After praying to the Lord for a certain amount of time, we may find ourselves saying, O Father in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we say Lord Jesus and O Father in heaven, the more we have peace and joy within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our experience it is impossible to separate the Father from the Son or to separate the Son from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Father Being the Source,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>the Son Being the Expression,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>and the Spirit Being</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>the Fellowship of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can illustrate the triune nature of God with the three forms of water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you leave a block of ice in the sun for an hour, it will become water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then if you leave the water in the sun for half a day, the water will become vapor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Are the ice, water, and vapor three things or one thing?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are one thing in three stages, appearances, and forms.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ice is ice, water is water, and vapor is vapor, but in substance these three items are one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In appearance they are three, but in substance they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a limited way, this is an illustration of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Scriptures the Father is the source; He is like the block of ice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Son, who is the expression of the Father, can be likened to the water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 1:18 says, No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Father is the source, and the Son is His declaration, manifestation, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit, who is the communion and fellowship of God to us, can be likened to the vapor 2 Cor 13:14; John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Vapor is very easy for us to take in; all we need to do is breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes when the air in a room is too dry, we put a vaporizer in the room to moisturize the air so that as long as we are breathing, we are receiving the water into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through the Spirit, who is the communion and fellowship of God to us, we can receive God Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>BETWEEN ETERNAL SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>AND GOD S JUDGMENT OF HIS CHILDREN Salvation Being a Free Gift and Being Eternal</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another mystery in the Scriptures is the relationship between eternal salvation and God s judgment of His children.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The salvation of God is absolutely a matter of grace and has nothing to do with works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 2:8-9 says, For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some have the concept that if we commit a sin after we have been saved, we will lose our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not logical.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If salvation is absolutely a matter of grace and has nothing to do with works, it is not logical to think that we can lose our salvation by doing something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If it were possible for us to lose our salvation through wrongdoing, salvation would have something to do with works.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we receive salvation, we can never lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In John 10:28 the Lord makes this matter very clear, saying, And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The life that we have received is eternal, and we can never perish 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First Corinthians 5:5 gives us an example of a brother who committed a terrible sin yet did not lose his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Speaking of this brother, Paul says, Deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although this brother had committed a serious sin, Paul says that he would still be saved in the day of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once we are saved, we can never lose our salvation.</S>
