   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's eternal purpose is to gain a man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This man is a corporate man coming out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is not a matter of several Christians being put together with several other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not so many "men"; it is a life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is the church only because there are many people who all share the same life, the same Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You have a portion of Christ, and he has a portion of Christ; each one of us has a portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When all of these portions of Christ are put together, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must be clear that God does not want individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God created man, male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The male is singular, and the female is also singular.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is singular, and the church is also singular.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the sight of God there is only one Christ and only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the future we will see that there is only one man in Hades and only one man in the heavens; there is no third man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In God's eyes, He only sees two men in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 15 reveals that Adam is the first man and Christ is the last man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are no others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Body of Christ, just as Eve, is one not many!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, even though we have God's life within us, we still need God to work upon us to break our individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God must break down the thought that I myself am enough.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to be one with all the rest of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is only one Eve; likewise, there is only one Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of God's children, all who share the life of Christ, are not many individual men and women; they are all one man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God must break our individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He must crush us day after day until we come to know the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are many who think that they can be Christians all by themselves!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But God will not allow this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Often their individual prayers are not answered, their personal study of the Scriptures does not enlighten them, and their individual seeking does not lead them to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If such a person would say to another brother or sister, "I just cannot get through this matter by myself, would you help me?", and they prayed together, he would be clear eventually.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever he could not understand by himself, he would see clearly when an answer was sought with his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a person is often still proud, thinking that he can make it by himself most of the time, and that there are only a few times when he cannot get through.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the church individualism must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must allow the Christ in us and the Christ in all the other brothers and sisters to become knit together in one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many Christians know the life we have in Christ, but we must regretfully say, they do not know the life in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as the life of Christ is a reality, the life of the Body of Christ is also a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christians are not individuals; they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The apostle Paul said that though we are many, we are still one bread and one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we live according to Christ, we are one with all other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if we live according to ourselves, we separate ourselves from all of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, if the church is to become a real church, two steps are necessary: the spreading or increase of Christ and the consuming of our self.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The spreading of Christ began when we were regenerated, and since we were saved, the Lord has been working on us day after day to consume our self.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord will continue to work until one day before God, we say, "There is not a single thing I can do by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything I do is done according to the principle of mutual help among the members.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All that I do is according to the principle of fellowship, which is the principle of the Body."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only that which is of Christ is the church; whatever issues from man is not.</S>
