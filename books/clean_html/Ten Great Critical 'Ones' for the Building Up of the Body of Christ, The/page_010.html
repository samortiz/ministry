<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You. You have gathered us again together around You as the Spirit and around Your Word as life. We love You, Lord, as the Spirit, as the Word with life. We desire to see what You are to us. In all these rich items, be with us, strengthen us, and uphold us. Amen.<p>In the previous message, we saw Christ from eternity, through creation, and through His incarnation, His human living, His all-inclusive death, His resurrection, and His ascension. In ascension He was appointed to be many items, first as the Lord of all, the Christ, and last as the surety of the new covenant. Now He is both in the heavens and in the church life. In the church age, He takes care of His church as many items.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN THE CHURCH AGE</h2><p>Christ is the Shepherd of God’s flock, the door for them to come out of Judaism, and the pasture for them to feed on (John 10:11, 14, 16, 9). He is the resurrection, the life, the way, and the reality (John 11:25; 14:6). He is the Bridegroom who has the bride (John 3:29a).<p>Christ is the power of God and the wisdom to His believers from God: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). He is the Passover for the believers to pass through God’s judgment (1 Cor. 5:7). He is the spiritual food and the spiritual rock flowing with living water for God’s people (1 Cor. 10:3-4; John 6:35; 4:10, 14). He is the Body (1 Cor. 12:12) and all the members of the Body—the new man (Col. 3:10-11). As the members of the Body, all of us are Christ. We should declare that we are not only members of Christ but also Christ. Christ is the firstfruits, the second man, and the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:20, 23, 47, 45). He is the first, the second, the last, and every number.<p>He is the Firstborn from the dead to be the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18). He was the Firstborn of all creation, belonging to the old creation of God. Now He is the Firstborn from the dead as the Head of the Body in the new creation. He is God’s allotted portion to the saints (Col. 1:12), typified by God’s allotted portion of the good land to the people of Israel. Today He is also the body (the reality) of all the positive things to God’s people (Col. 2:16-17). He is the real feast, new moon, and Sabbath. He is everything. All the things in the Old Testament were shadows, and He is the body, the reality, of all those shadows. He is the life of His believers and the One whom they live and magnify (Col. 3:4; Phil. 1:20-21).<p>Christ is the Lamb accomplishing God’s redemption and the Lion fighting for God’s kingdom (Rev. 5:5-6). For God’s redemption, He is a Lamb. For God’s kingdom, He is a fighting Lion, the Lion of the tribe of Judah. He is also the opener of the seals of the secrets of this age (Rev. 5:5). This implies the contents of the entire book of Revelation. Christ is also His believers’ hope of glory (Col. 1:27).<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN HIS SECOND COMING</h2><p>At the end of the church age, after He has been so many items to take care of the church, He will be the coming One. First, He will come secretly as the morning star who will appear to His overcomers before His coming back to the earth (Rev. 2:28). In the early morning, before most people awake, the morning star appears. Very few will see Christ as the morning star. He is also the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings to appear to the whole world (Mal. 4:2).<p>His riches dispensed into His saints are unsearchable (Eph. 3:8). In the church age He dispenses His riches to the believers, and those riches are unsearchable, untraceable.<p>He is the Savior coming back to transfigure His believers (Phil. 3:21). He will change the form of our body; this transfiguration is called the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). Christ has regenerated our spirit. He is now transforming our soul, conforming our soul to His image. We are also waiting for His coming back to redeem our body, to change our body from the low level to the highest level of His body, a glorious body. Then our whole being will be saved. When I was young, some would ask me, “Are you saved?” I did not know how to answer them. Later I realized that I can say, “I have been saved in my spirit; I am now being saved in my soul; and I will be saved in my body.” Hallelujah for this threefold salvation of our spirit, our soul, and our body!<p>Peter speaks of the salvation of the soul, that is, the salvation by transformation (1 Pet. 1:9). Our being transformed is the progress of the salvation of our soul. When we are matured, we will be completely saved in our soul. The only way to be transformed in our soul is for us to be crossed out. We have to be conformed to Christ’s death (Phil. 3:10). When this process is completed, we will be saved in our soul to wait for our body to be saved.<p>Christ will judge His believers to discern who among them should be rewarded with the kingdom and its enjoyment as a reward for one thousand years; and who among them should be disciplined in the kingdom age, thus missing the kingdom as a reward (2 Cor. 5:10).<p>Christ will come back to marry His overcomers as His bride in the millennial age (Rev. 19:7). Today we are engaged, not yet married, to Christ. When He finally saves our body to change our body, we will be ready for our marriage with Him. Revelation 19 says, “His wife has made herself ready” (v. 7). Christ still cannot marry us because we are not completely saved. He will not marry a bride with an old body in the old creation, full of sin, death, weakness, and sickness. He cannot marry us until He saves us in our body. At that time we will be completely a new man; we will be a new man in our spirit, a new man in our soul, and a new man in our body.<p>The Lord will also come to defeat Antichrist and his armies (Rev. 19:19-21). First, He comes to transfigure us; second, to marry us; and third, to defeat Antichrist. As the Bridegroom, the One who has just been married, He will defeat Antichrist. Christ, the General, will be the Bridegroom, and His army will be His spouse, His corporate bride, composed of all the overcomers. We should tell the Lord, “I want to be an overcomer, Lord. I will then be a part of the bride, as one of Your overcomers, to overcome Antichrist with You.”<p>When Christ returns, He will be received by the remnant of the Jews (Zech. 12:10; Rom. 11:26). Antichrist will surround the city of Jerusalem, fighting against the Jews to put them all to death. At that time, the Messiah will appear. On the one hand, the Messiah will defeat the enemy; on the other hand, the remnant of the Jews will see Him, the One whom they pierced, and they will repent. Christ will be received by them. Today the Jewish nation is unbelieving. They do not receive Christ. They do not believe there has been such a Christ as we preach, as the New Testament reveals.
