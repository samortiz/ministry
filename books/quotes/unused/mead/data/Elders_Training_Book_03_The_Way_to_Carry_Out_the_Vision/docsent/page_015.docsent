   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND OF CHRIST, THE SPIRIT, LIFE,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE CHURCH CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that to develop ourselves in the truth we need basic principles to rule us and to govern us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we must see that there is a further governing principle which is very basic Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Your developing of any truth must be based upon Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This should be and must be your governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not pick up aspects from the Bible not related to Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, Ephesians 5 tells us that wives should be subject to their own husbands v. 22 and that husbands should love their wives v. 25 . From my youth I heard the pastors and Christian teachers teach these things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These things, however, should not be separated from Christ and the church v. 32 . The woman s submission and the man s love are taught in the Bible with Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without Christ, who can submit or who can love?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fallen mankind s nature is rebellious and hateful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no submission or love within fallen mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is nothing but rebellion and hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without Christ, who can love or who can submit?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the Bible teaches us women s submission and men s love with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must be filled in spirit with Christ Eph 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then love comes out and submission comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we develop submission and love without Christ this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This becomes Confucius s ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A biblical submission is not only with Christ, but also for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After over twenty years experience of the church life in the United States, we have seen that whoever loves the church has the best family life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whoever is for the church has the best marriage life, but the family life and the marriage life of those who have left the church goes downhill.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By the Lord s mercy, the rate of separation and divorce is lowest in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must love Christ and love the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you do, as a wife you will submit and as a husband you will love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This again is the way to develop the truth based upon and governed by the principle of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Holiness, humility, kindness, victory, and spirituality must be developed with Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To allegorize any kind of case in the Bible, both in the Old and New Testaments, you must allegorize with Christ and for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then you are safe, and whatever you say is right because the entire Bible was written according to the basic principle with Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even the great Babylon on the negative side must be understood in the light of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The safeguarding key of the ministry is with Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have allegorized many portions of the Word and have put out many publications by this key and governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have even published a book on the Psalms under the view of this governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The title of this book is Christ and the Church Revealed and Typified in the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The principle of with Christ for the church safeguards you, rules you, supports you, and enriches you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>An interpretation of the Psalms using this key will be filled with the divine riches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In our developing in the truth we must first keep the principle of the Triune God dispensing Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is one of the basic principles that governs our interpreting of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second basic principle is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the past, the Brethren told people that to interpret the Bible you must be dispensational.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a young man under the feet of the great teachers among the Brethren assemblies, I was charged definitely and repeatedly not to interpret the New Testament according to the Old Testament since they are in two dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The understanding of dispensations helps to some extent, but this is too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To interpret the Bible according to the principle of the Triune God dispensing Himself into His chosen people is much deeper, higher, and more profound.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Another deeper principle is that we must interpret the Bible with Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even the first two chapters of Genesis should be interpreted under this governing principle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Genesis 1:26 we see Christ as the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God created man in His own image in Genesis, and in the New Testament Colossians 1:15 tells us that God s image is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Genesis 2:9 we see the tree of life, which also refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Adam is also a type of Christ being the Head of all God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God s image outwardly, God s life inwardly, and the Head of all creation is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we develop these items with Christ we are on the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With Adam s wife Eve we see the church Gen 2:21-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first two chapters of the Bible show us Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must realize that these first two chapters govern the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After these two chapters man fell, and that began another story.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why we can see that the consummation of the Bible in Revelation 21 and 22 corresponds with the first two chapters of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These four chapters correspond with each other, and both are with Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the principle for the beginning of the Bible and for the consummation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Also, the entire Bible between these four chapters must also be interpreted with Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even though so many negative things came in, they are related indirectly to Christ and indirectly to the church by providing a black background to help our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now we can see that we can interpret the entire Bible with Christ for the church.</S>
