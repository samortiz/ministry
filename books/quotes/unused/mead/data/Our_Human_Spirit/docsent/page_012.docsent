   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR OUR HUMAN SPIRIT BORN OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 3:6b; 4:24; Eph 2:1; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>11:19; 18:31; 36:26-27 TWO SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is evident that in this verse there are two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first Spirit is capitalized, referring to the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second spirit has a small letter, referring to the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That which is born of the divine Spirit is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our human spirit needs to be born of the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ezekiel 11:19, 18:31, and 36:26 tell us that God promised to give His people a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This new spirit, according to Ezekiel 36:26 is not the Holy Spirit, because in Ezekiel 36:27, after the mentioning of the new spirit, it says God will put His own Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are two kinds of spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One is the new human spirit and the other is God's Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is able to give us a new spirit by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What God promised in Ezekiel 36 is still being fulfilled in John 3:6.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In John 3:6 we are told that our spirit has to be born of the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not just to revive it; it is not just to restore it; but it is to regenerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regeneration and restoration are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regeneration is not just a restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Restoration means to restore, to recover some old things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But regeneration means to put another life into the old thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not to generate, but to regenerate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To generate means it doesn't exist, but to regenerate means it exists already and now another life is put into it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Genesis 1 and 2, man was made in God's image, but by that time man didn't have God's eternal, uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What man had was just the breath of life, not the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So after the creation of man, God put man before the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The tree of life signifies the divine life, the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God put man before the tree of life that man would take His life, but before man took the life of God, man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>REGENERATION AND GOD'S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Due to the fall, man needs redemption, but redemption is not God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Redemption is not God's aim.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Redemption is just God's procedure of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Redemption brings fallen man back to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if you are redeemed, if you haven't received the life of God, God's purpose has not been fulfilled with you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of course, as long as we receive redemption, we get the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God put these two things together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God makes an all-inclusive deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Most Christians just care for redemption and not so much for life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But we have to realize that redemption is just a recovery procedure for the final purpose, which is to have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's final purpose is to put His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This putting of His life into us is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Strictly speaking, regeneration has nothing to do with our fall.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Redemption takes care of our fall; regeneration takes care of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>REDEMPTION AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can use Coca-Cola bottles as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The bottles are for containing Coca-Cola, but all the bottles fell into the trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, you need to recover them, to bring them back.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But to bring them back is not to fulfill their purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you bring all the fallen bottles back, and you clean them with detergent, they are still empty.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This bringing back takes care of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After being brought back, and after being purified and cleansed with detergent, you need a further step to fill the bottles with Coca-Cola.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are the bottles, the vessels Rom 9:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before we were filled with the life of God, we fell into the trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before we were saved, we were in the trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Praise the Lord for God's mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One day He came to the trash can and brought us out.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That was redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Redemption takes care of our fall.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At the same time, God put His divine life into us.</S>
