   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE PREREQUISITE OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ACCORDING TO THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY 3 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:16-17; 3:14; 1 Cor 14:29b; Acts 2:42a; Eph 4:14</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous message, we saw that we need to have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery to discern the present problems raised up by the dissenting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we want to address more of the items raised up by these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>J. Concerning the One Accord</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Can we be in one accord if we have differences?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The answer to this question is "yes."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must be in one accord in spite of the differences.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both in the Gospels and in Acts, we are taught to be in one accord Matt 18:19; Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom 15:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some would say that we must get rid of all the differences among the believers in order to be in one accord, but this is only to make everything uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament churches, there were many differences.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Romans 14 Paul said that we must receive both those who regard a certain day and those who do not vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1, 5-6a .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul said that we must receive the believers who may differ from us in their doctrinal concepts or religious practices because God and Christ have received them 14:3; 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since both God and Christ have received them, how can we not receive them?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul said that some ate only vegetables, while others ate all things Rom 14:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must receive both because God and Christ have received them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In receiving the believers, Paul was very broad and liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was not narrow-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>More than twenty-five years ago, there was a sister among us who was Jewish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day she told me that even when the dishes and forks used for eating pork were washed with detergent, she could still smell the pork on them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are all kinds of people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all have been saved, yet we have many differences.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some practice foot-washing or head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some baptize by immersing one time, while others baptize by immersing three times.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If all of these different believers were among us, could we have the one accord?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would love to see church meetings of believers in one accord with all kinds of differences.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That would be marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1963 in the church in Los Angeles, there were at least four different groups meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the previous year, I held the first conference in the Lord's recovery in the United States, and I spoke from Deuteronomy 8 concerning the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These messages attracted many people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When others heard about these messages, they invited me to hold conferences in their places.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, when the first conference ended on December 31, the next day I went to Whittier, California and spoke to a group that was composed mainly of Brethren believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, they asked me to go to speak to another group in Las Vegas.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The group there was an independent Bible church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I visited them on about four different occasions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, that whole congregation decided to move to Los Angeles in order to join the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This group and at least three other groups came to Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day they all agreed to come together.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the place where we met jointly in Los Angeles in 1963, I put up two banners.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first banner read "Unity versus Uniformity," and the second banner read "Unity with Variety."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the beginning in Los Angeles, this was our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We had much variety, but we also had the unity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later I went away to New York.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In my absence, the slogans on the banners did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>During a meeting, one of the young sisters began to play the tambourine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One of the brothers from the Brethren group told the sister to stop playing it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I received a phone call about this incident while in New York.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I arrived back in Los Angeles, I spoke with the brother from the Brethren group.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I asked him to compare the tambourine with the piano, and he said that he preferred the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I said, "Brother, in the eyes of God, what is the difference between these two musical instruments?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He agreed that there was no difference in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I continued by saying, "Since these two instruments are the same in the eyes of God, they should also be the same in our eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The brother responded by saying that he could not take the playing of the tambourine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I said, "Brother, since you cannot take the playing of the tambourine, you are unable to live the church life."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church life must be of unity with variety.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be in one accord does not mean to get rid of all the differences.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If this were the case, we could never have the one accord in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must be exercised to such an extent that we keep the unity without caring to have uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should be happy to see a meeting full of differences, yet without any discord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the early days in Los Angeles, some tongue-speakers came into one of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When they began to speak in tongues in the meeting, some of the brothers looked at me to see what I would do.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually, the brothers motioned to me that I should stop them when these ones began to interpret their tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But I said quietly to the brothers that we should let them go ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can take such differences.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A number of years ago, some brothers took the way of the Lord's recovery, but they would not practice the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When this matter was referred to me, I said that there was no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whether they liked to have the Lord's table or not, they had been received by the Lord, so we had to receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church in their locality kept this practice of not having the Lord's table for a good number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In spite of this, the saints there were really one with the saints in the other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There was one accord in spite of the differences.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Gradually, the brothers and sisters who did not practice the Lord's table heard about it and wanted to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today they have the Lord's table regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is an example of keeping the unity with variety.</S>
