<h1 class="title">THE KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING GOD<br />
BEING OUR LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:54-57; Col. 3:4</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING OUR LIFE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s children do not have a thorough and accurate view concerning the divine life. Although many children of God love Him, fear Him, and are pious, not many know that God is their life. The fact that every believer has the life of God seems to be a doctrine, because few believers practically experience God as life every day. Many believers are proper and good, but few genuinely live in God and take Him as their life.</p>
<p>We must learn the difference between persons who are proper and good and persons who live in God and take Him as their life. Do not think that a well-behaved person lives in God or that a God-fearing person lives by God. To be well-behaved or God-fearing is different from living in and by God.</p>
<p>As believers, we should know the purpose of salvation and know the meaning of Christianity. There are many groups in Christianity, but the majority of them teach only a kind of religious piety. They neither see nor express the divine life. Strictly speaking, Christianity is not a religion. The Christian faith is not a matter of behavior but a matter of life. Christians are not followers of a religion. Christians have received Christ as their life because Christ entered into them when they believed in Him. However, most of God&rsquo;s children do not know this. The new believers among us must know this matter.</p>
<p>I knew that I was saved nearly thirty-five years ago. I will never forget the way I that was saved. Even though I had never heard that the Lord can meet man, on that day I had to admit that the Lord met me. I was a young person who loved the world, loved my future, and had likes and dislikes. However, the Lord met me and saved me. I was not saved out of a fear of going to hell or a desire to go to heaven. Rather, I was saved because I saw that without God, my life would have no meaning. Even if I gained the whole world, I would still be empty without God in my life.</p>
<p>One day I heard the gospel of how mankind is under bondage and slavery in the world, of how this world usurps man and keeps him from turning to God, and of how empty and vain life is when man puts God aside. The Lord opened my eyes, and before the message was finished, I said, &ldquo;O God, if this is the case, I do not want the world any longer. I want only You.&rdquo; I did not know whether this was a prayer or a vow. I only knew that after I said this, my inner condition changed. When I left the meeting place, I felt light, as if I were flying in the air. On my way home I prayed, &ldquo;I do not want the world anymore. I want only God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the way that I was saved. At the time of my salvation, I did not confess my sins, nor did I know that I was a sinner. I only felt that I was a person following the world. I wanted the world, education, future fame, and a position; I wanted a good future. After I was saved, I discovered that I was corrupt and had numerous sins. Later I read in the Bible that the Lord bore all my sins on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24) and that my sins were forgiven (Col. 1:14).</p>
<p>I loved the Lord after I was saved. I enjoyed praying, and I enjoyed reading the Bible. As far as I was concerned, the Bible was a sweet book. Not only did I spend time reading it every day, but I also read it before going to bed every night. When I woke up in the morning, I would pick up the Bible and read a few lines before getting up. Furthermore, while getting dressed, I would meditate on what I read. This is the extent to which I loved the Bible.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed praying. I often had the urge to go to the mountain or to the seashore in order to pray. I dared not sing of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; name, because as soon I sang, I would burst into tears. The sweetness and loveliness of the Lord became an indescribable power that caused temptations, sins, lustful things, and the world to drop off of me.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even though I was so close to the Lord, I did not know that He was my life, nor did anyone tell me this. I often went to a group of people who were capable of expounding the Bible and giving the best messages. They gave five messages per week, and I never missed a message, even when there was two feet of snow outside. For seven and a half years I listened to about two thousand messages.</p>
<p>I thought the messages were enjoyable. The speakers had a thorough knowledge of the Bible and were able to connect the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation. One of the persons there was called a living concordance because he was able to give the book and chapter of any verse that was quoted from the Bible. These believers were able to speak in detail concerning the signs, numbers, types, and prophecies in the Bible.</p>
<p>However, I never heard them say that the Lord Jesus came to be life to man. They said that those who believe in the Lord Jesus would receive everlasting life. But they never said that this everlasting life is the eternal life of God. I had heard the term <em>everlasting life</em> innumerable times, but I had no idea what it meant. No one told me that everlasting life is eternal life, which is God and also the Lord Jesus. The God who came into me is the Lord Jesus, and He is also eternal life; He came into me to be my life. No one told me this.</p>
<p>One day the Lord had mercy on me and showed me the way of life. Then I began to consider, &ldquo;What is the purpose of expounding the signs, numbers, types, and prophecies in the Bible? These messages are not life, but people need life.&rdquo; As a result, I stopped going there to listen to the messages.</p>
<p>From that time onward, I had a great turn. The Bible in my hand changed completely. I was familiar with the Bible and could recite many portions accurately because I had spent seven years studying the Bible. When I realized that the Lord was life to me, the Bible became a new and living book to me. Whatever I read in it became a matter of life. Ever since that day God has led me to see life. In particular, for the past ten years I have not been able to give a message that is not concerning God being our life. If I did not speak of God being our life, the message was empty. God has not given me any other burden. God in the Son and through the Spirit has entered into me to be my life. The Triune God is in us to be our life.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s unique thought is to be our life. If you ask me what God wants to do with us, I would answer, with full assurance, that He has no desire to do anything other than to be our life. Perhaps you think that God wants us to do many things, but these things are not central or important. The central thought of God is that He wants to enter into us to be our life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
