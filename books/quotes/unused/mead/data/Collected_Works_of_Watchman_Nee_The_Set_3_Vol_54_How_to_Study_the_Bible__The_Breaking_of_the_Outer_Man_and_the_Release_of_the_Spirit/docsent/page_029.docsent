   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 21 says, "And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How real a living faith is!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time all their future seemed to lie in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No household had more prospect than they had in the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet Jacob said, "God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In whose hand was this land at that time?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was not in his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet he said, "I have given to thee one portion."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In effect he was saying that even though Joseph was governor over Egypt, his land was not Egypt, but Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He knew that Ephraim and Manasseh were two persons, and therefore that Joseph should have a double portion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 49 gives us one of the greatest prophecies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jacob foretold what would happen to every one of his sons and every one of the tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He blessed by faith and in obedience, and everything was clear to him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 29 through 30 say, "And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 33 says, "And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At his birth he was busy holding on to the heel of his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At his death he gathered up his feet properly into the bed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was not hasty or restless and was not struggling with God in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must observe that the Bible is full of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we contact this spirit with our spirit, we touch the tender and precious points of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to contact not only the stories and the doctrines in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to touch the spirit behind the Bible with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul Revealed through 2 Corinthians</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Among Paul's Epistles, 2 Corinthians stands out as the book that reveals more of his spirit than any other book.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Other Epistles tell us the revelations that Paul received, but this Epistle reveals to us the very person Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Other Epistles speak of his ministry, while this Epistle speaks of his person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It shows us the riches, purity, and meekness that lay within his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was more misunderstood by the Corinthians than by any others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Corinthians were uninhibited in saying all kinds of things about Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet what clarity and purity we find in the spirit of Paul's word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can say that Paul's spirit was more released through the Corinthians' misunderstanding than through his trials which he faced in the last chapters of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we read through 2 Corinthians sentence by sentence, we will understand not only Paul's thoughts but also his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will notice that even when he was rebuking, his spirit was not provoked.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only those who are full of love can rebuke others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If our spirit cannot match Paul's spirit in 2 Corinthians, we may take his boasting to the Corinthians as a kind of complaint.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But we should realize that while the words may be the same, the spirit can be totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two persons can say the same thing and mean the same thing; they can even use the same terms.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But their spirits can be very different.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have listed only two examples.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Throughout the Bible we can detect such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some places are more obvious, while others are less obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Either we should give up reading the Bible altogether, or we have to bring our spirit up to the level of the spirit of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moses went through many trials.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have not entered into the spirit of these trials, we will not understand these portions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The book of Psalms is much deeper than the book of Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If our spirit does not match the spirit of the psalms, we cannot understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The same holds true for the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If our spirit does not match the spirit in the books of the New Testament, we cannot understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, we have to learn some basic lessons before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must be a spiritual person before we can read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must be consecrated, and we must not be subjective, careless, or curious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must have impressions of the facts, and we must enter into the thoughts of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After we have all of these, we still need more.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our spirit has to be up to the standard, and we have to be dealt with by the Lord to the point that we can identify with the spirit behind every portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must have this kind of spirit before we can understand God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do not touch the spirit, we will only have letters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may even misunderstand God's Word or turn the meaning all around.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When a father speaks to his children, his children must touch the spirit of their father's words.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If they do not and then spread his words around, they may end up saying something entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is a spirit behind all the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we neglect this spirit, we will not understand the feeling and the motive behind the words, and we will run the risk of missing the content of the speaking altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let me repeat: If a man has not been dealt with by the Lord, it will be hard for him to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to remember that the way to study the Word is to have our being dealt with by God.</S>
