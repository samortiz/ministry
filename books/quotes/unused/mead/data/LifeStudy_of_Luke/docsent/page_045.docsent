   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN GALILEE 5 Scripture Reading: Luke 6:17-49</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall continue to consider 6:17-49, where the Lord Jesus teaches His disciples the highest morality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>NOT JUDGING BUT FORGIVING</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 37 says, And do not judge, and you will by no means be judged; and do not pass sentence, and sentence will by no means be passed upon you; release, and you will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here to pass sentence is to condemn, and to release is to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not condemn, we shall by no means be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, if we forgive, we shall be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we live in a humble spirit under the Lord s ruling, we shall always judge ourselves, not others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s children will be judged with what they judge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If they judge others with righteousness, they will be judged by the Lord with righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If they judge others with mercy, they will be judged by the Lord with mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As James 2:13 says, Mercy triumphs over judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Years ago I heard what C. H. Spurgeon said in a sermon on forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In that sermon he pointed out that it is difficult for Christians to forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said that we may think that we have forgiven someone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, our forgiveness can be compared to burying a dead dog and allowing the tail to show.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After forgiving someone, we may say, So-and-so offended me, but I have forgiven him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to show the tail of the dog.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have really forgiven someone, we should also forget the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once we have forgiven someone in a matter, we should not mention it again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every time we mention an offense which supposedly has been forgiven, we are pulling out the tail of the buried dog to show others that the dog has been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do this, it indicates that we have not released the one who offended us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the New Testament, to forgive means to forget and to release.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to forget the offense and release the offender.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once we have done this, we should never speak of the matter again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>GIVING TO OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 38 the Lord goes on to say, Give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will give into your bosom; for with what measure you measure, it will be measured to you in return.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>M. R. Vincent has pointed out that here bosom denotes the gathered fold of the wide upper garment, bound together with the girdle, and thus forming a pouch.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here the Lord is saying that when we give to others, our Father in heaven will always return to us much more than we give.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I once heard of a saint who was considering giving a particular gift to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this case the gift was a number of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First this saint had the thought of giving away ten fish.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the more he thought about it, the more he reduced the number.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At a certain point he realized that the thought of giving less was a temptation from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Becoming angry with the Devil, he said to him, Satan, if you keep on tempting me, I will give away everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This illustrates our need for the willingness to give.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we give to others, we shall receive in return.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What we measure to others will also be measured to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A PROFOUND PARABLE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 39 says, And He spoke also a parable to them: Can a blind man guide a blind man?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Will not both fall into a pit?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the time of speaking, this word could have applied to the leaders among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Matthew 15:14 the Lord called the self-righteous and arrogant religionists blind leaders of the blind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They thought they were clear concerning the way to serve God, but they did not realize that their eyes were veiled by their religion with their traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, they could not see the reality of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their blindness led them to fall into the pit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The parable in Luke 6:39 is simple, yet it reveals the divine wisdom of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I doubt that any philosopher has spoken such a parable.</S>
