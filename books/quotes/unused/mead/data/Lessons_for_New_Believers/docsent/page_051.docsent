   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOSPEL MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The sixth kind of meeting is for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This meeting is also very important.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In particular, new believers should exercise to participate in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Bringing People</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the brothers and sisters should bring people to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not merely come by ourselves, but we should try our best to bring people to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How do we bring people?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to make a list of our relatives, friends, classmates, colleagues, and those who are close to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From this list we should invite those who have never heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes we may be unable to bring them directly; rather, we may need to use various means, such as inviting them for a meal or preparing a ride for them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not be discouraged if we need to invite them repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know from experience that once a person has been invited, that invitation will influence him even if he does not come.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more he is invited, the greater the responding power within him will be.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then when he does come, he will be saved dynamically.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, we should never give up on those who decline our first invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sitting beside People</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After bringing a person, we need to accompany him by sitting beside him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we sit with him, we should do five things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, we should help him locate the Bible verses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the speaker mentions a certain book, a certain chapter, or a certain verse, we should help him find it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, we should help him find the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the hymn is written out, we should point it out to him; if the hymn is in the hymnal, we should look it up for him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, we should explain the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There may be some special terms in a gospel hymn; if the speaker does not explain them clearly, we should explain them to him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Fourth, we should pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While we sit with him and help him, we need to observe his condition and silently pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Fifth, we should help him receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the speaker asks everyone to indicate a willingness to receive the Lord, we should not leave him to his own discretion and let nature take its course.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, we should encourage him a little without being rude or forcing him to stand up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All these should be done appropriately and properly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Contacting and Speaking with People</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the meeting, we should contact and speak with the one we brought.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If it is inconvenient to speak with him, we can ask other brothers and sisters to speak with him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In speaking with him, we need to pay attention to three things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, we should strengthen the message that he heard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not discuss another subject with him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Based on the message spoken, strengthen the meaning of the message and his response to the message.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second, we should lead him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After speaking with him for a short time, we should lead him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Speaking too little does not save people, and neither does speaking too much.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes we miss the opportune time for prayer because of our excessive speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Consequently, it is difficult for people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, after speaking with our guest, we need to lead him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This prayer will often result in his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Third, we should help him to leave his name and address to facilitate further contact with him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Visiting People</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After the gospel meeting, we should bear the responsibility to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>First, we should visit according to a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Second, we should take some brothers and sisters with us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The brothers and sisters can help us to solve any problems we would be unable to solve on our own.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Third, we should continue to visit until the person we are visiting is saved, baptized, and enters into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then the church can help bear the responsibility for him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, we often still need to be responsible to visit him for a period of time after his baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May we all enter into a proper practice of the bread-breaking meeting, the prayer meeting, the meeting for the exercise of gifts, the Bible-study meeting, the ministry meeting, and the gospel meeting so that the church and all the saints can be greatly blessed.</S>
