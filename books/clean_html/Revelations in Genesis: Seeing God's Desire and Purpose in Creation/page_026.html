<h2 class="head3">It Not Being Good for God to Be Alone</h2>
<p>In Genesis 2:18 God said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone.&rdquo; This indicates that the only thing missing in the universe was a counterpart for Adam. According to the Bible, however, Adam as a man refers to God. That it was not good for Adam to be alone means that it was not good for God to be alone. In the Bible God is in the position of a man, and the God-created man is in the position of a woman. In Song of Songs in the Old Testament the Lord is in the position of a man, and those of us who belong to the Lord are in the position of a woman. The Lord is our Beloved, and we are His lover (S. S. 1:13-15). Furthermore, prophets such as Jeremiah and Hosea declared that God is a Husband, and His people, the children of Israel, are His wife (Jer. 3:14; Hosea 2:7, 16). When God as the Word became flesh and came into the world, John the Baptist testified of Him, saying, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice&rdquo; (John 3:29). Later the Lord Jesus also referred to Himself as the Bridegroom, saying, &ldquo;The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast&rdquo; (Matt. 9:15). The Lord Jesus also prophesied that when He comes again, those who wait for Him will be like virgins waiting for their Bridegroom (25:1-13). In the Epistles the apostle Paul said to the believers in Corinth, &ldquo;I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:2). Although there are males and females among us, truthfully speaking, we are all females before God; only God is male.</p>
<p>Our living in the world is like a theatrical play. While we are on this stage, some are playing male roles, and others are playing female roles. However, when a husband and wife kneel down before God in prayer, they leave the stage. Then in the eyes of God, both are female. When a husband and wife are living before men, one is a male, and the other is a female, playing in a family drama. When they leave the stage and kneel down before God, they are both female.</p>
<p>The only male in the universe is God Himself. A male is the object of a female&rsquo;s love, and he draws her heart to desire him. God, as the only male in the universe, is able to captivate man&rsquo;s heart. He is man&rsquo;s object and center. Although on the surface there is an order arranged by God, with brothers playing male roles and sisters playing female roles, we are all females when we come before God. This is the reason that Paul says, &ldquo;I betrothed you to one husband&rdquo; (v. 2); he also speaks of Christ as the Husband and the church as the wife (Eph. 5:23-24). Moreover, the Bible also says that Christ&rsquo;s coming back will be the time for His wedding (Rev. 19:7). Christ, the embodiment of God, is the Bridegroom, and those who believe into Him are the bride. We all have been engaged to, betrothed to, Christ, but the time of our marriage has not yet come. When our Lord comes again, He will appear to those who do not believe in Him only as a Judge, whereas to us who believe, He will also appear as a Bridegroom.</p>
<p>The wedding feast of Christ will last one thousand years. The millennial kingdom will be the time of the wedding feast revealed in Revelation (vv. 7-9; 20:6). In the new heaven and the new earth, all those who have been redeemed by Him will be the city of the New Jerusalem, which is His bride becoming the wife of the Lamb, living a life in oneness with Christ in eternity (21:2, 9).</p>
<p>God created and redeemed us for the purpose of preparing a counterpart, a bride, for Himself. As soon as we believed into the Lord, we were betrothed and engaged to Him. Since that day, we have been waiting for Him to come back. When He comes back, a wedding feast, the time of the millennial kingdom, will begin. After the wedding feast in the millennial kingdom, there will be a married life for eternity. In eternity God as the only male and those who have been saved by grace as His wife will live a life of eternity together. For this marriage Adam symbolizes God. That it was not good for Adam to be alone means that it is not good for God to be alone. God does not like to be alone in the universe. God wants man to be His counterpart. Hence, it was not good for Adam to be alone. This background shows that God is in need of a counterpart.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God Desiring to Gain a Counterpart</h2>
<p>With such a background, God brought every animal of the field and every bird of heaven to Adam to see what he would call them. God might have wanted to test Adam to see if he could find a counterpart among these creatures. However, all the creatures that were brought to him were different from him, because they were not man. Adam looked at and named every creature, but he did not see or find his counterpart (Gen. 2:19-20).</p>
<p>This symbolizes that after God created all things, He considered everything that He had created to see if He could find a counterpart who could match Him. The account of Adam and Eve has symbolic significance. God built Eve to show His desire for a counterpart.</p>
