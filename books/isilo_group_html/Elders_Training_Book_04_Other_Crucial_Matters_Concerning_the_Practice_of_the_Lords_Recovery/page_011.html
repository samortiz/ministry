There is a need of a clear view of the region of the work among us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. In The Normal Christian Church Life Brother Nee said something about the region of the work. One sentence from this book should be quite impressive to all of you-Brother Nee said the church is local and the work is regional. Every church is local. It cannot be extra-local. The work, however, is regional and not local.<h2 class=head1>TWO REGIONS NOT TWO WORKS</h2><p>Brother Nee said this based upon the fact that the Bible reveals that the work of the Lord on this earth as the New Testament ministry had two regions. The first region was in Judea, which was mainly among the Jews, and the second region was in the Gentile world, which was mainly for the Gentile churches. It is also clear that in the record of the New Testament, the work in the region of Judea for the Jewish churches was under the leadership of Peter, and the work in the Gentile world for the Gentile churches was under the leadership of Paul (Gal. 2:7-8). This is also clearly recorded in the book of Acts (Acts 1:15; 2:14; 9:15; 22:21).<p>Some would take a standing to say that these were two works-one for the Jews in the Jewish land and one for the Gentiles in the Gentile world. One work was by a group of workers having Peter as the leader, and one work was by a group of workers having Paul as the leader. We must realize, however, that the Lord does not have two moves on this earth. He has only one move. Also, the Lord does not have two bodies on this earth. He has only one Body.<h2 class=head1>ONE MOVE, ONE BODY, AND ONE TESTIMONY</h2><p>Actually, in this one Body there is no difference between the Jew and the Gentile. Every kind of distinction has altogether disappeared in the Body. In the Body there are no regions and there are no Jews or Greeks. For such a Body the Lord only has one work on this earth. From the New Testament we can see that the Lord has one move on this earth, one Body, and only one testimony. According to space and time, His New Testament move, His Body, and His testimony are universal. These three aspects must impress us very deeply. The Lord only has one move, one Body, and one testimony.<p>While the ministry is going on, it is regional. This does not mean, however, that the Lord has different moves in different regions and that He has different bodies and different testimonies. This does not mean that the ministry or the work under Peter&#8217;s leadership in the Jewish land was for one kind of testimony, and then the work and the ministry under the leadership of Paul in the Gentile world was for another kind of testimony. The Lord has, in the New Testament age, one unique ministry for one move to produce one unique Body as one unique testimony.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 04: Other Crucial Matters Concerning the Practice of the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
