   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE MEANS AND BASE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE INCREASE AND SPREAD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46; 5:42; 20:20 THE INCREASE AND SPREAD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE CHURCH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the previous chapter we pointed out that the knowledge of the truth and growth in life are for the church s increase and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we also should realize that the increase and spread of the church are the increase and spread of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus referred to Himself as a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the only begotten Son of God, He was the one grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He went to the cross, He fell into the ground and died.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then in resurrection He produced much fruit, that is, many grains as the multiplication of Himself as the unique grain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Much fruit in verse 24 refers to those who believe into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Testament reveals that the only begotten Son of God became flesh, passed through human living, and died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After passing through death, He entered into resurrection to impart His divine life into those who believe into Him so that they could become many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Individually speaking, these grains are individual believers; collectively speaking, they are the one Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through the multiplication of Christ, He is both increased and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The increase and spread of the church is the increase and spread of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through His death and resurrection, Christ has been propagated, increased, and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is present on every continent of the whole earth, and the expression of this spreading Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the surface, the book of Acts is merely a record of the activities and work of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In actuality, it shows how the resurrected Christ in His ascension and by the Spirit of power has been multiplied continuously on the earth through His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This propagation begins in Acts 2, and it does not stop even at the end of chapter 28.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Bible readers throughout history acknowledge that the book of Acts has no conclusion; it is a book that transcends time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps God in the heavens today looks upon the continuing acts of His disciples as further chapters in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Gospels there was Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then in Acts 1 there were one hundred twenty believers in Jesus, each of whom was His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this regard, the one Jesus was multiplied by one hundred twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter 2 three thousand people were saved on the day of Pentecost v. 41 , bringing the number of Christ s multiplication to three thousand one hundred twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then in chapter 4 another five thousand men were added v. 4 . In chapter after chapter of Acts there are the continuous increase and multiplication of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapter 21, when Paul went up to Jerusalem, James said, You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed v. 20 . This means that by the time of chapter 21 the propagation of Christ had reached many thousands just in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The increase and spread did not begin with us; it began with Peter and continued with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Acts Peter, Paul, and all the other saints continuously propagated Christ so that Christ could be increased and spread on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today in the twentieth century there are genuine Christians in every large city of every continent on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The number of those who have been washed by the Lord s precious blood, who have been regenerated with the divine life, and who have become members of Christ to be constituted as the Body of Christ is in the hundreds of millions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is His propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, in comparison to the population in the world, the propagation of Christ is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, the population of Taiwan is close to twenty million, but there are less than one million Christians in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not even one-twentieth of the population.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord s recovery first came to Taiwan in 1948 and 1949, there were meetings in only three to five places.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thirty-five years later there are more than eighty churches; nevertheless, there are three hundred eighteen towns in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, we have spread only to one-quarter of the towns in Taiwan; three-quarters of the towns do not have the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, Christ needs to multiply in Taiwan and to advance from multiplying to spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not long ago many of us made a vow before God that we would lead one person to the Lord in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that the Lord would double our number through propagation in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we presented this consideration to the saints, we felt this was not much to ask since it should be easy to gain one person when we are daily involved in the burden and work of propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to our experience with fruit trees, a tree that grows only one piece of fruit is rather unsightly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If some saints have already borne one fruit, it would be good to bear even more.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should be able to bear fruit during each of the four seasons in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We also need to recover the saints who have not been meeting for a long time, even those with whom we have lost contact.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have heard many testimonies of how some of those who have not been meeting with us for a while have been revived and recovered through the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a fourfold propagation would truly make this a year of propagation.</S>
