The book of Hebrews says that she received her dead by resurrection (11:35). Let us turn to Paul's parting word to the Ephesian elders. He invited the elders in Ephesus to come to Miletus, comforted them with words, and testified to them, saying, "The Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in city after city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me. But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God" (Acts 20:23-24). Paul risked his life for the Lord's name. He was able to say that he considered his life of no account as if precious to himself. The Lord has no intention that every one of us should be a martyr, but we need to have the heart of a martyr, which is not to love our soul-life. Paul did not love his soul-life, and he considered his soul-life of no account as if precious to himself. This is the proper attitude for every servant of the Lord.</p><p>In Acts 15:26 the church in Jerusalem wrote a letter to recommend Paul and Barnabas to the church in Antioch. The letter said that they were "men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ." In his recommendation of Epaphroditus, Paul said that "for the work of Christ he drew near unto death, risking his life" (Phil. 2:30). In his greetings to Prisca and Aquila, he said to the church in Rome, "Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles" (Rom. 16:3-4). All of these did not love their own lives. They are patterns to us, the believers.</p><h2 class="head1">A MIND TO SUFFER</h2><p>First Peter 4:1-2 tells us that a mind to suffer is a weapon. If a man is armed with such a mind, he will not live in the lust of men but in the will of God. This, however, does not mean that we look for sufferings, nor does it mean that we mortify ourselves. We have to see the difference between suffering and having a mind to suffer. A suffering man is not necessarily one who has renounced his self-love, but someone who has a mind to suffer surely has renounced his self-love.</p><p>Some people feel weak when they skip a meal, and they resign from the Lord's work once they have a headache. How much the Lord is restricted in these ones! Of course, this does not mean that we should expose ourselves to unnecessary risks. Our boldness is with respect to the Lord. The Lord loves us; He did not love Himself. Therefore, He laid down His life for us. We should not love ourselves for this same reason; we should lay down our life for others. Those who love themselves cannot love others, because they have exhausted all their energy on self-love.</p><p>Those who love their own soul-life will lose it, but those who lose their soul-life for the Lord's sake and who do not love themselves will find life (Matt. 10:39). Satan once attacked Job; now he is attacking the believers. In order to overcome Satan, believers must realize that the basis of victory is the renunciation of their self-love.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> </body></html>
