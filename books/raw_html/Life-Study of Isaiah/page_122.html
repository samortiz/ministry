<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. These Ones Coming from a Distance</H2><P>Verse 12 says, "Behold, these ones will come from a distance,/And some will come from the north and the west / And others from the land of the Sinim." Here the word Sinim probably refers to the Chinese.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Heavens Giving a Ringing Shout</H2><P>In verse 13 the heavens are commanded to give a ringing shout, the earth to rejoice, and the mountains to break forth into singing, for Jehovah has comforted His people and will have compassion on His afflicted ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. HOW JEHOVAH TREASURES ZION</H2><P>Isaiah 49:14-21 reveals how Jehovah treasures Zion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Not Forgetting Her</H2><P>Because Jehovah treasures Zion, He will not forget her. "But Zion has said, Jehovah has forsaken me,/And the Lord has forgotten me./Can a woman forget her nursing child,/ That she would not have compassion on the son of her womb? / Even though they may forget,/Yet I will not forget you" (vv. 14-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Having Engraved Her<br>upon the Palms of His Hands</H2><P>In verse 16a Jehovah tells Zion that He has engraved her upon the palms of His hands.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Her Walls Being Continually before Him</H2><P>Zion's walls are continually before Jehovah (v. 16b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Her Captives Making Haste to Return</H2><P>Zion's captives will make haste to return. She will put all of them on like an ornament and will gird herself with them like a bride (vv. 17-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Her Waste Land Being Too Constricted<br>Because of Her Returned Captives</H2><P>Her waste, desolate, and devastated land will be too constricted because of her returned captives (vv. 19-21).</P>
