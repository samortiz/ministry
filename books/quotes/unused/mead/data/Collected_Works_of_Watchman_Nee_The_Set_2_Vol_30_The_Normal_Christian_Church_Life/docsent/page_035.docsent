   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5 RACIAL DIFFERENCES.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit" 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jews have always had the strongest racial prejudice of all peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They regarded other nations as unclean, and were forbidden even to eat with them; but Paul made it very clear, in writing to the Corinthians, that in the Church both Jew and Gentile are one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All distinctions in Adam have been done away with in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A racial "church" has no recognition in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Church membership is determined by place of residence, not by race.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today in the large cosmopolitan cities of the world there are churches for the whites and churches for the blacks, churches for the Europeans and churches for the Asiatics.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These have originated through failure to understand that the boundary of a church is a city.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God does not permit any division of His children on the ground of difference of color, custom, or manner of living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No matter to what race they belong, if they belong to the same locality, they belong to the same church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has placed believers of different races in one locality, so that, by transcending all external differences, they might in one church show forth the one life and the one Spirit of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All that comes to us by nature is overcome by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All that was ours in Adam has been ruled out in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The whole matter hinges here are all carnal differences done away with in Christ, or is there still a place for the flesh in the Church?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Are our resources in Christ sufficient to overcome all natural barriers?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us remember that the church in any locality includes all the believers living there and excludes all who live elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>6 NATIONAL DIFFERENCES.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jews and Gentiles represent national as well as racial distinctions, but in the Church of God there is neither Jew nor Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no racial distinction there, and there is no national distinction either.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All believers living in one place, no matter what their nationality, belong to the one church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the natural realm there is a difference between Chinese, French, British, and Americans, but in the spiritual realm there is none.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a Chinese believer lives in Nanking, he belongs to the church in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a French believer lives in Nanking, he also belongs to the church in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same holds good for Britishers, Americans, and all other nationalities, provided they are born again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Word of God recognizes the church in Rome, the church in Ephesus, and the church in Thessalonica, but it does not recognize the Jewish church, or the Chinese church, or the Anglican church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason the names of cities appear in Scripture in connection with the churches of God is that the difference of dwelling place is the only difference recognized by God among His children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their life is essentially one, and is therefore indivisible, but the place in which that life is lived cannot but vary as long as they remain in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since the churches are all local, if a believer whatever his nationality moves from one place to another, he immediately becomes a member of the church in the latter place, and has no church connection in the place of his former residence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You cannot live in one place and be a member of the church in another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no extraterritoriality in connection with the churches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As soon as you exceed the city limit, you exceed the church limit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a Chinese brother moves from Nanking to Hankow, he becomes a member of the church in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In like manner, a British brother coming from London to Hankow immediately becomes a member of the church in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A change of residence necessarily involves a change of church, whereas naturalization has no effect on church membership.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our fellow workers who have gone from China to the South Sea Islands must be careful not to form an Overseas Chinese church there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is possible to have an Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce, or an Overseas Chinese College, or an Overseas Chinese Club.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Anything you like can be Overseas Chinese, but not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A church is always local!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you go to any city in a foreign land, then it follows as a matter of course that you belong to the church in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is nothing Chinese about the churches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How glorious it would be if the saved in every city could overlook all natural differences and only consider their spiritual oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"We are the believers in Christ in such-and-such a place" is the finest confession a company of Christians can make.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whether Christ is in you or not, determines whether or not you belong to the Church; where you live determines the particular church to which you belong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The question put by God to the world is, "Do they belong to Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The question put by God to believers is, "Where do they live?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not nationality but locality is the question raised.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The churches of God are built on city ground, not on national ground.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The usual conception of an indigenous church, while quite right in some respects, is fundamentally wrong at the most vital point.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since the divine method of dividing the Church is according to locality, not nationality, then all differentiation between Christian and heathen countries is contrary to God's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Church of God knows neither Jew nor Greek; therefore, it knows neither native nor foreigner, neither heathen country nor Christian country.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Scriptures differentiate between cities, not between countries, heathen and Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>So if we would be in full accord with the mind of God, we must make no difference whatever between the Chinese and foreign church, between Chinese and foreign workers, or between Chinese and foreign funds.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The thought of the indigenous church is that the natives of a country should be self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating, while the thought of God is that the believers in a city whether native or foreign should be self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Take, for instance, Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The theory of the indigenous church distinguishes between Chinese and foreigners in Peking, whereas the Word of God distinguishes between the believers in Peking whether Chinese or foreign and the believers in other cities.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That is why in Scripture we read of the churches of the Gentiles, but never of the church of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The attempt to form all Chinese believers into one church shows a lack of understanding in regard to the divine basis of forming churches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand, there is no church of the Gentiles in Scripture; on the other hand, we read of "the church of the Thessalonians."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is suggestive that this is the only expression of its kind used in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Word does not speak of the church of the Greeks a race, or nation , but of the church of the Thessalonians a city .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is no such thing in the thought of God as the church of the Chinese, but there is such a thing as the church of the Pekinese.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Scripture knows nothing of the church of the French, but it does recognize the church of the Parisians.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A clear apprehension of the divine basis of church formation according to the difference of cities and not of countries will save us from the misconception of the indigenous church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There should be no distinction whatever between Chinese and foreign Christians, between Chinese and foreign workers, or between Chinese and foreign money in any given locality.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>7 SOCIAL DISTINCTIONS.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Paul's day, from a social point of view, there was a great gulf fixed between a free man and a slave; yet they worshipped side by side in the same church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In our day, if a rickshaw coolie and the president of our republic both belong to Christ and live in the same place, then they belong to the same church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There may be a mission for rickshaw coolies, but there can never be a church for rickshaw coolies.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Social distinctions are no adequate basis for forming a separate church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the Church of God there "cannot be slave nor free man."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In Scripture we have at least seven definite things referred to which are forbidden by God as reasons for dividing His Church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As a matter of fact these seven points are only typical of all other reasons the human mind may devise for dividing the Church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The two millenniums of Church history are a sad record of human inventions to destroy the Church's oneness.</S>
