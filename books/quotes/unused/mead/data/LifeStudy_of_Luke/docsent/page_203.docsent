   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Seeking Rest and Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do you know what it means to suffer?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do you know the significance of suffering?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The real significance of suffering is twofold: to suffer is to have no rest, and to suffer is to have no enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God created man with the appetite, the aspiration, for rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God created man with such an aspiration because God s intention was that man would continually seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, every human being is seeking rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rest requires satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a person does not have satisfaction, he cannot have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From experience we know that we can rest only when we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, satisfaction comes from enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, if we do not have enjoyment, we do not have satisfaction; and if we do not have satisfaction, we do not have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everyone is hungering and thirsting for rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be without rest and enjoyment is to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reason a brother desires to get married is that he is seeking rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He thinks that he cannot find rest in anyone other than a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He regards marriage as something that will provide rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, a sister desires a husband because she thinks that married life will be a couch on which she may rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why do we need marriage?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need marriage because we want rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, how much real rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment do you experience in your married life?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many can testify that in married life the suffering may be greater than the rest and satisfaction and that the troubles may be greater than the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suffering in married life may be caused even by the issue of whether the bedroom window should be open or closed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A husband and wife may argue over a matter such as this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although people get married because they need rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment, the real rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment are not found in married life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have seen that the rich, as well as the poor, have their sufferings in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, someone with a large savings account may worry about inflation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even though he has thousands of dollars in the bank, he may still be anxious about money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In every area of human life the debit side may be greater than the credit side.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that whatever choice we make regarding a particular matter, the result may be more debit than credit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether we are married or unmarried, rich or poor, the debit may be larger than the credit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The destiny of every unsaved person whether married or unmarried, rich or poor, is hell.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why people need God s salvation; this is why they need the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without God s salvation, a person is going downward to hell, no matter what his situation may be.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who are educated and cultured and those who are uneducated and uncultured are all going downward to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because they are on this downward way, they cannot have any rest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How they need to hear the preaching of the gospel, the sounding out of the jubilee!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Fallen mankind has lost God and is in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consider the situation of the children of Israel in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the Israelites were under bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It may seem that Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, was superior, but he also was in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both the Israelites and the Egyptians had lost God and were in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, today fallen mankind is in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The rich and the poor, the educated and the uneducated, the married and the unmarried all are in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only when we have God are we no longer in bondage, for God is our release, our liberty, even our liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because fallen man has lost God and is in bondage, he does not have the real rest or enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the result, the issue, of man s fall.</S>
