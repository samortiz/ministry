God&#8217;s dispensing includes creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and eventually the rapture. Today we are still under the process of the dispensing of Christ. God&#8217;s economy is to dispense Christ into us, and to dispense Christ into us simply means to work Christ into us. In the whole universe, what God has been doing and still is doing is to work Christ into us. This is what we call the economy of God, the dispensing of God.<p>The economy of God is simply a matter of the dispensing of Christ into all of us, and the issue of God&#8217;s dispensing of Christ is the church. This kind of speaking is not common in today&#8217;s Christianity. Perhaps many have never heard the term the dispensing of Christ into us or that God&#8217;s economy is to work Christ into us. In Christianity we received many religious concepts. We heard that we were sinful and that we were going to hell, but God was so merciful to us that by His great love He loved us, He saved us, He granted us repentance, He gave us faith, He forgave all our sins, and He even regenerated us; now we are qualified to enter into the heavens to enjoy eternal life. Some have gone even further, saying that while we are on this earth we have to adjust ourselves, improve ourselves, and glorify the Father. I do not say that these concepts are wrong. They are not wrong, only too superficial, too shallow. They are too short of God&#8217;s economy. Today in the Lord&#8217;s recovery the Lord has shown us something deeper, something more solid. God&#8217;s economy in this universe is not merely to save people from hell into heaven. God&#8217;s economy is to have a corporate Body, a corporate man, which is the issue of the dispensing of all the riches of Christ. That is, God&#8217;s economy is to work Christ into us.<p>We have been created by God. We do not care for Darwinism; we do not believe that we are the descendants of the apes. We are the creatures in God&#8217;s creation, and God created us with a purpose. This purpose is that we would be a vessel. We are simply a vessel, a container. A vessel is made only to contain something. God in His creation made us containers, vessels, to contain Christ. This is fully revealed in Romans chapter nine. Romans 9 tells us that in God&#8217;s creation we were made vessels unto honor, vessels of glory (vv. 21, 23), to contain a treasure, Christ. Second Corinthians 4:7 tells us that Christ is the treasure and we are the earthen vessels. Now the treasure is in the earthen vessels. It is not merely that we are convicted and forgiven of our sins. It is not simply that we are saved from hell and brought into heaven. The central point of God&#8217;s intention, of God&#8217;s economy, is that Christ has to be worked into us.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S INTENTION BEING RELATED TO HOW MUCH CHRIST WE HAVE</h2><p>We are short of Christ. However, we may not have this concept. If a brother is wrong in his attitude to his wife, he may repent religiously, saying, &#8220;O Lord, I am wrong with my wife. Forgive me.&#8221; By the Lord&#8217;s mercy he may even go to his wife and say, &#8220;Please forgive me. I have been wrong in certain matters.&#8221; This is good, but it is rather religious. If we have received a vision, a revelation, from God, we will not simply repent. We will realize that we are wrong because we are short of Christ. If we were not short of Christ, we would not be wrong, but if we are short of Christ, even to be right means nothing. Whether we are right or wrong makes no difference. Religiously it makes a difference, but spiritually it makes no difference. If a brother is short of Christ, whether he loses his temper with his wife or is good to her makes no difference. We may compare this brother to an electric lightbulb. If a lightbulb does not shine with electricity, it makes no difference if it is dirty or clean. We may wash the bulb, but it still does not have electricity. We are the vessels to contain Christ and to shine out Christ. Whether we are good or we are bad, whether we are a success or we are a failure, makes no difference as long as we are short of Christ. God does not care whether we are right or wrong. God cares for one thing-how much Christ we have.<p>To be right or wrong is according to the law, but today we are not in the dispensation of the law; we are in the dispensing of Christ. God has turned us from the law to Christ. God does not care merely whether we hate people or love people. This makes no difference. God cares for how much Christ we have. Praise the Lord, everyone among us has Christ, but the difference is in how much Christ we have. One may have much of Christ while another has only a little. God&#8217;s intention, God&#8217;s economy, is to work Christ into us. This is God&#8217;s work. To adjust our temper does not mean anything. A wooden podium never loses its temper. In this sense it is much better than we are, but what good is this? God&#8217;s intention is not a matter of not losing our temper. God&#8217;s intention is related to how much Christ we have. It is not a matter of law. It is not a matter of what we do or do not do. It is a matter of how much Christ we have. Today we do not have the dispensation of good and evil; we have the dispensing of Christ. Therefore, we all need a turn.<p>We all need to have a renewed mind. In this country I have been speaking for nine years, and many have been listening to my messages for all these years. However, I still do not have much confidence that we all are clear about God&#8217;s intention. Some may be clear in the meeting and may go home and say, &#8220;Hallelujah, now we are clear!&#8221; But the next morning they may be the same as they were nine years ago. If we lose our temper with our wife, we may know how to repent, but we may not realize that we are short of Christ. A sister who wears short skirts may receive the enlightenment that she is not proper. However, she should not merely repent concerning her clothes. She must realize that she wears such clothes because she is short of Christ. Similarly, a young brother should realize that he has long hair and a beard because he is short of Christ. Some who came among us with long hair eventually cut their hair. They did this because they had received more Christ. All our problems are due to our shortage of Christ. We must realize that we are short of Christ and that God&#8217;s economy today is just to work Christ into us.<p>Many Christians today are divided. Christianity today has many divisions because Christians are short of Christ. If we are short of Christ today, tomorrow we may be divided. Division comes out of the shortage of Christ. For the proper church life we need an adequate measure of Christ. Without the proper measure of Christ we cannot have the proper church life because the church life is the issue of the dispensing of Christ, the issue of God&#8217;s working of Christ into us. The proper church life is simply Christ Himself. How much church life we have depends on how much Christ we have. If we have more Christ, we have more church life. This is a very important matter. I look to the Lord for this. I do not care for a message, and I am not giving a lecture or a sermon. To speak eloquently does not mean anything. My burden is to stir us up and cause us to be troubled concerning our shortage of Christ. Christians today are too much at peace. We need this kind of trouble.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
