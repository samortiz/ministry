   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE THREE GOD'S RESTORATION AND FURTHER CREATION 1 PROCESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have seen already, God's creation is fully covered in chapter 1, verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Also, Satan's rebellion is covered in the first half of verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"And the earth became waste and empty; and darkness was upon the surface of the deep."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 2a, there are five main points: the fact that the earth became something different from what it was originally; the waste and the emptiness; the darkness and the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Keep these five items in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the earth was judged due to Satan's rebellion, it became waste and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Darkness is another indication of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Exodus 10:21-22 and Revelation 16:10 show that darkness is a result of God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There was darkness when God exercised His judgment upon Pharaoh, and there will be darkness when He exercises His judgment over the antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the darkness in Genesis 1:2a points to God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition, we know that light accompanies life and that darkness always signifies death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Where life is, there is light; where death is, there is darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reverse is also true: where there is death, there is darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the darkness in Genesis 1:2 also signifies that the earth was under a condition of death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word "deep" means the deep water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Bible, water has two meanings and symbolizes two different things, one positive and the other negative.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the positive sense, water always signifies something living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The flowing water brings life to people and quenches their thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the negative sense, water signifies death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For instance, when we were baptized in water, that water represented death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Also, the waters of the Red Sea and the waters of the River Jordan both represent death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The water mentioned in Genesis 1:2 doesn't represent life, but indicates death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we conclude that the earth was under death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The earth not only was waste, empty, and meaningless, but was filled with death and was under death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the midst of this situation, God came in.</S>
