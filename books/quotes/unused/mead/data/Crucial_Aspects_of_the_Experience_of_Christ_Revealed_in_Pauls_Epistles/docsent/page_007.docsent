   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING AN ENRICHED, UPLIFTED, MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we were saved, something of God was added into our spirit through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our spirit has been enriched and uplifted by being born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, at the time of our regeneration God s Spirit came into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our regenerated human spirit is indwelt by the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before regeneration, the conscience is the only functioning part of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without being regenerated, the best that men can do is to develop their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when we are saved, Christ regenerates us by giving us God s divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition, God the Spirit comes into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, our spirit is mingled with God s Spirit into one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A glass of water may be enriched by having tea, honey, and milk added into it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Similarly, when we were regenerated, we received God s life and nature, the effectiveness of Christ s all-inclusive death, His resurrection power, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All these riches have been added into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to realize that we have all the riches of God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God created man, He wanted to enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, man became fallen and sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of sin, man even became dead, and his heart became incurably corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was our condition before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before the holy, righteous God could enter into such fallen beings, He needed to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, He became a man in incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God put on the flesh of man and lived as a man on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then He willingly went to the cross to die on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God judged our sins on the cross, and Christ shed His blood to cleanse our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, Christ s death terminated our flesh, our self, the old creation, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, Christ solved all the problems between God and man; the cross cleared up the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then Christ was buried and rose after three days.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Death could not hold Him, because He is the resurrection John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the resurrection, He overcame death and defeated the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He took a tour of Hades and walked out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By resurrection He changed His form He was transfigured, transformed from the flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The life-giving Spirit is an all-inclusive drink, which has had many ingredients added.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first ingredient was divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then through incarnation the element of humanity was added.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, all the experiences of human life were added through Christ s thirty-three and a half years on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Finally, all the accomplishments of Christ s death and the attainments of His resurrection were added.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, in resurrection Christ became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Divinity, humanity, Christ s human living, His all-inclusive death, the effectiveness of His death, the power of His resurrection, and His resurrection life are all in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 7:39 says, This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit who was not yet is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit of God existed already, but the ingredients of Christ s processes and accomplishments had not yet been added.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After Christ s death and resurrection, the Spirit was ready as an all-inclusive drink.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Revelation 22:17 says, The Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We feel that everything, including the devil, sin, and the world, is under our feet.</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to walk, live, act, speak, and move according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead of praying each morning to know the Lord s will concerning where we should go and what we should do each day, we need to pray, Lord, thank You for another day for me to live You.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Wherever I go and whatever I do and say, I want to practice to be one spirit with You so that everything I do and say would be according to You.</S>
