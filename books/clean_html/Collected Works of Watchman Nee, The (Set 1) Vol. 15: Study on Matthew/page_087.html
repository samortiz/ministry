<P>In the original text there is another word worth noting concerning the Lord's coming again. It is erchomai, which means "to come"; it is an active verb. Parousia means "presence"; since it is a matter of presence, there must be two persons, and hence the rapture is implied. When the Lord's erchomai is mentioned, it does not include the rapture of the saints. Erchomai is used seven times in Matthew 24 and is used eight times in Matthew 25 (Matt. 24:5, 30, 39, 42-44, 46; 25:6, 10-11, 13, 19, 31, 36, 39).</P><P>There is another word, proserchomai, which means "to come to the presence." It is also used here (Matt. 24:1; 25:20, 22, 24).</P><P>There is another word, deute, which means "come here" (Matt. 25:34).</P><P>There is another word, heko, which means "has come already" (Matt. 24:14, 50). From this we can see the accuracy of the Bible in using words.</P><P>The third question of the disciples was, "And what will be the sign...of the consummation of the age?" For the word age there are two Greek words: (1) kosmos, which means the material aspect of the organized world and is different from aion; and (2) aion, which refers to time. In the Bible there is the term of the world; it means to be caught by the organized things in the world. According to Genesis 1:1 this world is already the second one. In the Bible there is also the term of the age, that is, to be caught by the customs, the current, of the age, or to be fashionable.</P><P>The disciples asked concerning the consummation of this age. The word "age" here is aion. "End" is a specific term. It can be translated "the end time"; it can also refer to the great tribulation (which will last for three and a half years and not seven years). The consummation of this age is the end of the age of grace, the age of the church. "The consummation" spans a period; it begins with the rapture to the throne and ends with the appearing of the Lord with His saints from the air. Hence, this is comparable in time to the parousia. But the locations are different, because the parousia refers to the things that are happening above, while "the consummation" refers to the things that are happening on the earth.</P><P>Now let us see when the first major section will be fulfilled. Generally, there are two explanations: (1) It was fulfilled at the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70, because verse 2 has been fulfilled completely. (2) It has not yet been fulfilled, because the subject of Matthew 24 is the great tribulation. But we do not agree with either of these explanations. Those who agree with the first explanation include Scofield, and those who agree with the second explanation include Darby. We know that there are two destructions of Jerusalem. In A.D. 70 the destruction by Titus was only the first.</P><P>There are seven big reasons to argue against the first explanation: (1) At that time there were self-proclaimed Christs, but they did not perform miracles (v. 24). (2) The abomination of desolation has not been fulfilled. The abomination of desolation is the idols. This means that idols are put into the temple. The first school says that this has already been fulfilled because there was the flying of the flag in the temple. However, at the time of the flying of the flag in the temple, the Jews were no longer able to flee. Yet verse 16 says, "Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains." (3) The Lord commanded the Jews to flee. This kind of fleeing is a most urgent kind of fleeing, but at that time there was not such a necessity. (4) After such a destruction the whole world should be influenced, but at the time of Titus there was not a worldwide influence. (5) At the time of Titus the celestial phenomena did not change. (6) The result of the destruction should be the Lord's appearing, but at that time the Lord did not appear. (7) This section is parallel with Revelation 6. Revelation was written in A.D. 96. The destruction by Titus occurred in A.D. 70. If it had already been fulfilled, why would Revelation speak about things that had happened twenty-six years before?</P><P>The temple will be destroyed at least twice. Daniel 9:26 says, "And the people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary." Verse 18 uses the word "desolations." Daniel 9:27 says that "he...will replace the sacrifice and the oblation with abominations of the desolator." This is the second destruction. These two destructions are completely different in time. One took place after the sixty-two weeks, whereas the other will occur within the one week. Verse 26 mentions the people of the prince, and not the king. Titus was a prince and was not a king. Then verse 27 refers to the king himself, who will be the Roman king. In the original text, "the end" and "to the end" in verse 26 both refer to the end of the age. Hence, we know that the first destruction is before the end of the age.</P><P>We will compare a few verses. By these verses we will become more clear that there must be a second destruction of the holy city. Revelation 11:2 says that the Gentiles will trample the holy city for forty-two months. (See also 13:5 and 2 Thessalonians 2:7, which do not refer to the destruction by Titus, because after the destruction by Titus the gospel began to spread.) Matthew 21:41 states that after the first vinedressers were killed, new vinedressers were hired. So in the first major section, verses 4-6 have already been fulfilled. Verses 7-14 are not yet completely fulfilled. They are still being fulfilled. Verses 15-31 are not fulfilled yet.</P><P>In comparing the other three Gospels, we see that both Mark 13 and Luke 21 record these things, but there are differences. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, all three Gospels, record the first question. Mark and Luke contain more detail than Matthew. Whatever was said by Matthew was said by Mark and Luke also (except for the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the earth). Concerning the second question, there are more differences, and concerning the third question, there are even contradictions.</P>
