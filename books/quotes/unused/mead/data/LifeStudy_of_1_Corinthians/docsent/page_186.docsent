   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REASONS FOR NOT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENCOURAGING TONGUE-SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My desire is to speak for Christ and to speak forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, especially as a help to the young people, I am burdened to make it clear why I do not encourage tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although I do not oppose speaking in tongues, I do not encourage it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My reasons are based on my experience and observation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not encourage today s tongue-speaking because it can be compared to opium or morphine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Medical doctors know that opium and morphine can be useful in dealing with certain kinds of pain or illnesses, but the dosage has to be limited and the use restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Used under proper direction with adequate limitation, opium and morphine can be helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The danger is in becoming addicted to these drugs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once a person is addicted to either opium or morphine, the result is dreadful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many may practice tongue-speaking for a period of time and then give it up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Others, however, become addicted to speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They may become addicted to such an extent that when they meet together they do not care for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are so much for tongue-speaking that they are not concerned even if the so-called tongue is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second, for the long run, tongue-speaking does not help believers to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the contrary, addiction to tongue-speaking may lead to the indulgence of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yes, some have testified that speaking in tongues stirred something within them to seek after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a proper result of tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But those who become addicted to tongue-speaking care only for their ecstasy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not care for sobriety.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, there are many cases of fornication among them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Third, those who have become addicted to tongue-speaking have no ear to hear the word of the cross and the deeper things concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are not interested in how the cross of Christ deals with the flesh and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They do not care for such a sober word of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are like a piece of wood that has been ruined by poor carpentry and cannot be used in making better furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have no heart for the deep things of Christ or the life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, they would have no ear for all the messages we have given on 1 Corinthians and on the four books that make up the heart of the divine revelation Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, they like to pay their attention to Acts 2, and 1 Corinthians 12 and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, they misuse these portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They have no heart to hear a sober word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Due to the burden I have received from the Lord and to His commission, I am concerned that Pentecostalism may creep into the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If this happens, the recovery will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This does not mean, however, that I oppose genuine tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Genuine tongue-speaking is of God, and I do not oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, I do not encourage today s tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, even the leaders in the Pentecostal movement have made adjustments throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They realized that without certain adjustments they would not be able to carry on their work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have learned that at the Assembly of God school in Springfield, Missouri, the students are taught to emphasize teaching, not tongue-speaking, in congregational meetings, and to encourage the people to speak in tongues privately.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, the practice of tongue-speaking has still frustrated many of those dear saints in the matter of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Fourth, no other Christians are as independent and divisive as those who promote tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every tongue-speaker is independent, individualistic, and divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Each one cares only for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By this we see that the enemy creeps in to use something which may be of God to damage God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Pentecostalism and in the charismatic movement there is no building, no Body life, no care for oneness, and nothing of the divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we can understand Paul s concept in 1 Corinthians and know the burden in his spirit and on his heart when he was writing this book.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul was deeply concerned for the Body of Christ and for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He knew God s heart and God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He knew that God s purpose is to have a Body to grow Christ and express Christ and also to have the church to carry out the divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today s tongue-speaking has been used by the enemy to frustrate the growth of the Body and to damage the building up of the church for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, I cannot encourage this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But I want to say again that I do not oppose genuine tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do not follow J. N. Darby in saying that speaking in tongues is dispensationally over.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No, it is still possible for there to be genuine tongue-speaking, but this must be practiced in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Tongue-speaking causes much more loss than profit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Each of the three times we tried to adopt this practice in the church life, we suffered loss.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our hope is that the Lord s recovery will be preserved from the damage that can be caused by today s tongue-speaking and go on in a pure way of life, not damaged by any mixture.</S>
