   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING THE FIRSTBORN FROM THE DEAD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians 1:18 reveals that Christ is the Firstborn from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is the Firstborn of all creation, and He is also the Firstborn of all the resurrected ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to this verse, He is also the Head of the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>CHRIST BEING THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaiah 9:6 is a puzzling verse, containing many points which no theologian can reconcile.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It says, "For a child is born to us, / A son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to this verse, the child is the Mighty God and the son is the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is Christ the Son or the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet Isaiah 9:6 says that the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, according to 1 Corinthians 15:45b, Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is confirmed by 2 Corinthians 3:17 which says, "And the Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this verse the Lord is Jesus Christ 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the Lord Jesus Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is Christ the Son, the Father, or the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, we have to say that He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>CHRIST BEING ALL-INCLUSIVE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many verses in the New Testament show us that Christ is a man 1 Tim 2:5; John 1:14; 4:29; 19:5; Acts 2:22; Rom 5:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Is He man or God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is both; He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is God, He is man, He is the Father, He is the Son, He is the Spirit, He is the Creator, and He is also the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is the Firstborn, and He is the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the First and the Last, the Alpha and the Omega Rev 22:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is not the first and the last only, He is also the second, the third, the fourth, and every letter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the Alpha, the Beta, the Gamma, and ultimately He is the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is everyone and He is everything Col 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to systematic theology, Christ is the Son only, but the Bible tells us that He is not only the Son, but also the Father and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Based upon this word some may think that I am for the "Jesus only" theology.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No, I do not care for any theology; I only care for the pure word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must forget all the theologies and teachings that we picked up from Christianity and come back to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In John 14 Philip asked the Lord Jesus to show him the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus rebuked him by saying, "Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In such a word the Lord seemed to say, "I have been with you for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Don't you know Me?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Haven't you seen Me?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you have seen Me, why do you ask Me to show you the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Don't you know that if you have seen Me, you have seen the Father?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus is wonderful and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is there God in this universe?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yes, but without Christ and outside of Christ we cannot find God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is in Christ, and Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Is there a real man in this universe?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yes, this real man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is there a heavenly Father?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yes, He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Is there the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yes, He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is there the Spirit of God?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yes, He is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we say that Christ is the Son and not the Father or the Spirit, then we cannot say that Christ is all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is God, He is the Father, He is the Son, He is the Spirit, He is a man, and He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eventually, Christ is even you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Philippians 1:21 says, "For to me, to live is Christ," and Galatians 2:20 says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This verse is very puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First, it says that "I am crucified with Christ"; this means that I am brought to an end. Then it says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me," yet "I live in faith." This indicates that, spiritually, Christ has become us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ is not only the Head but also the Body Col 1:18; 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ is everything.</S>
