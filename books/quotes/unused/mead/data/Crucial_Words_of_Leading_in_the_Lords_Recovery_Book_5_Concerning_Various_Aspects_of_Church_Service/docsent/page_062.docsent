   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN CONCERNING THE SUPPLY OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need the cleansing of Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We confess that even today we have unconsciously been contaminated in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Cleanse our conscience, cleanse our feeling, and cleanse our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We confess that we are truly weak and ignorant and that we are not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, please lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We look to You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You are the source, and You are what the Body needs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We open, and we give ourselves to You unreservedly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every Lord s Day morning more than three thousand saints listen to Your word; we do not want to take this matter lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, how will You lead us?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Reveal Your heart s desire again to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, only You know what we should do concerning the supply of the word in the small groups and after the table meeting on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We present ourselves before You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Cause each of us to feel a sense of responsibility and to not be spectators but rather be involved in bearing the Ark. Lord, we cry out to You again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have mercy on us and do not cast us into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With regard to the supply of the word in the big meetings on Lord s Day morning and in the small groups, I am still not at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that those who bear the responsibility to minister the word will regard this matter seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They should not take it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must regard the supply of the word very seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>ON THE SUPPLY OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is difficult for a local church that does not receive the supply of the rich, fresh, and living word to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The strength of a church depends on the supply of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can compare this to a family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether or not the members of the family are healthy depends on the person who distributes the food.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If poison is supplied, one meal can kill the entire family.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If only pea pods are supplied, everyone in the family will become very thin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If nutritious food is supplied, every member will be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, all the brothers who bear the responsibility to supply the word must regard this matter seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They should not consider it a light matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to our present situation, it would be excellent if the message on the Lord s Day morning could be coordinated with the message being read in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, we are not sure that we are able to use the Life-study messages one way in the small group meetings and use them in a totally new way for the Lord s Day message.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we use the messages in the same way, the saints may lose their appetite and stop coming to the Lord s Day meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God s word is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same message can be touched in one way in the small group meetings and in a completely different way on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, the brothers responsible for the word in each meeting hall must have thorough fellowship concerning this matter and consider every aspect of our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Keeping the Central Line</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Question: Every week we read a Life-study message in our morning time, we fellowship concerning the same message in the small group meeting, and on Lord s Day we fellowship again concerning the same message.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not want to merely repeat the same content in the message on the Lord s Day, but we are afraid to use our own utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result, we feel apprehensive, because we are not sure whether we are on the central point.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Answer: Let us take Message 1 of the Life-study of Galatians as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The opening section says that the book of Galatians is related to Christ; it is a book on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It says that Galatians speaks of Christ and of how this Christ becomes our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not a problem for us to develop this point.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Another section of the first message is concerning the background and subject of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The background of this book is that Judaism with its laws was replacing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a general statement and does not seem to apply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since we are neither Jews nor in the atmosphere of Judaism, how does this statement relate to us?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the brothers release the message, they need to apply this point to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the way to develop the central subject so that others get the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have given messages for over fifty years, and I know that nothing is more serious than being an outlet of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even today I confess that I still do not know how to give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When I was in school, economics was a broad subject that involved political science, geography, social science, and finances.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A person who wants to be an expert in economics has to be well versed in these relevant fields.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, I have realized that a person who speaks for the Lord needs an almost unlimited amount of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must possess not only general knowledge concerning many things; we must also have cursory knowledge of the biographies of spiritual men.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then when we speak, even when we give examples, we can apply our knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, our speaking should not cover too many subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The primary matter is to keep the central line.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whatever we say must follow the central line.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I can boast to you, and the saints who have listened to my messages for over thirty years can testify, that my messages have never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is because I saw a vision in 1935, and this vision has captured me such that I always center on it no matter what I say.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have developed many new terms, because as more and more riches are unearthed, new utterances are required.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Nevertheless, we have continually stayed on the central line of God s economy.</S>
