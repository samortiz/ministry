<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The result of sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Sin causes us to be under God&rsquo;s condemnation.</li>
	<li>Condemnation creates a distance and a barrier between us and God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The demand of the law
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The law represents God&rsquo;s righteousness, making absolute demands on man.</li>
	<li>The demand of the law confines the sinner under condemnation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The redemption by the blood
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ bore our sins to fulfill the demand of the law. Therefore, the blood of Christ is able to redeem us from under the law that the law could no longer confine us under condemnation.</li>
	<li>Since the blood of Christ redeems us from the condemnation of the law, it also abolishes the distance between us and God; thus, we are brought back to God. As sin and the law cause us to depart from God and become distant from Him, so the blood of Christ redeems us from under the law that we may return to God without anything between us and Him.</li>
	</ol></li>
