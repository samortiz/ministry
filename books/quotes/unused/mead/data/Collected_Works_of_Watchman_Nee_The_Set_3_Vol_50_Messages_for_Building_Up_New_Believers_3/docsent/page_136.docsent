   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Learning to Not Damage the Reality of Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The longer we go on in our Christian life before the Lord, the more we will realize the reality of the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sooner or later, we will see that oneness is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a very sobering reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must learn to not damage it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is lawlessness, rebellion, and disobedience for anyone to damage the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The authority of God will not be with us if we damage it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Authority must be manifested in every cell of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The cells in the Body function mutually, not individually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a marvelous fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more we comprehend the things of the Body, the more we will realize how appropriate it is to compare the church to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. The Principle of Two or Three</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is another principle in the Bible which we must obey the principle of the two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please read Matthew 18:15-20.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus said that where two or three are gathered together in one accord, whose voices are in harmony like that of music and who meet under or are gathered into His name, He will be in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever they ask, it will be done for them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a very great promise of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If two or three can be fully in one accord, the Lord said that He would be in their midst and would answer their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One Person Representing the Body</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord told us something more.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose I sin against a brother today and he comes to me and says, "You have done something which offends me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You were very wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose I say, "I do not think I was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are the one who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not feel that I was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I feel that I was very right."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since this brother says that I am wrong, what should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I should learn to listen to my brother.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I am a person who has learned this lesson before the Lord, I will immediately feel that I have sinned when the brother comes to me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is another principle in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One person can represent the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I may be right; I may think that I am not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this brother is much more experienced than I am in the Lord, and he has learned much in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He sees that I am wrong and corrects me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I am pliable before the Lord, I will immediately say, "Brother, please forgive me, I am wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One person is enough to be the authority; there is no need to have many people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The person beside you can be the authority; he can represent the Body, the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You must acknowledge that your independent way is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If one person points this out to you, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am not saying that you have to accept every reproof that comes along.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am saying that you should have a quick response before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Often there is no need to have two or three or the whole church tell you something.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You should touch and see something of the reality of the spiritual world as soon as one person says something to you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That person is the Body; he is enough to be a representative of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Two or Three Being the Authority</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sometimes there is the need for the testimony of two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When one brother comes to me, I may not see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That brother may invite one or two other brothers to come along, brothers who are clear before the Lord and who love the Lord wholeheartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They may be more weighty before the Lord and more mature in their service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When these two or three are called into the situation, they may say, "In our opinion, you are wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At such times, I should remember the word of the Lord: "For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst" Matt 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If these two or three are in one accord, the Lord will answer their prayer and do things for them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If they are in harmony in judging certain matters, the Lord will honor their judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the Lord honors their judgment concerning certain matters, should we not honor it as well?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the Lord accepts their discernment, should we not accept it as well?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the Lord considers what they have done in one accord as right, can we say that it is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should yield to their judgment immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the Lord agrees with their rebuke in one accord, can we afford to ignore it?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whatever they bind shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever they loose shall have been loosed in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Should we not follow what has already been done in heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Two or three can be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Of course, these two or three cannot speak rashly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They must be men of authority before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They must fear the Lord and obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If they tell you in one accord that you are wrong, even if you do not feel that you are wrong, you have to yield to their judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You have to say, "I am wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You do not have to wait until the whole church comes to you and tells you that you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The ones who are keen will know what to do as soon as one person comes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The ones who are slower will know what to do when two persons come.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Often you may not feel that you are wrong, but if two or three godly men see things the same way, you should humble yourself before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do not be proud and do not say that you are always right.</S>
