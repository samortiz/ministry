   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the sermon on the mount, the Lord mentioned the matter of the reward many times because this portion concerns the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 5:46 says, "For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 6:1-2 says, "But take care not to do your righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Truly I say to you, They have their reward in full."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 5 says, "And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites....They have their reward in full."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 16 says, "And when you fast, do not be like the sullen-faced hypocrites....They have their reward in full."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 4 says, "So that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 6 says, "But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The last part of verse 18 says, "And your Father who sees in secret will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every reader of the Bible agrees that the main subject of the sermon on the mount in Matthew 5 7 is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But here, the matter of reward is also repeatedly mentioned because the kingdom of the heavens is the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Matthew 16:27-28 says, "For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father and with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God will reward or punish a saved person according to his doings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are three facts here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, man will be rewarded according to his works.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The matter of reward is entirely based on works.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second, at what time will the reward be given out?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It will be given out when Christ comes in the glory of His Father with His angels.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Christ comes in the glory of His Father with His angels, that will be the time for Him to establish His kingdom on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, it is only when the kingdom begins that the reward will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Third, here is a type which speaks of a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The transfiguration of the Lord on the mountain typifies His manifestation in glory in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By that time some believers will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The verses in Matthew 6 which we just read regarding the reward for giving, the reward for prayer, and the reward for fasting all involve reward.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some think that the reward for prayer is God's answering of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But this is not all that is meant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus said that we have to pray to our Father who is in secret, and our Father who sees in secret will repay us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It may be possible to interpret this as the Father answering our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, both in the first part when the Lord mentions alms-giving, and in the second part when He mentions fasting, He said, "And your Father who sees in secret will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This repaying must refer to something in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, the Lord said that we have to pray to the Father who sees in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It does not say that the Father hears in secret, but that He sees in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When God gives out the reward in the future, He gives according to what He sees.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God sees with His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the reward is in the future.</S>
