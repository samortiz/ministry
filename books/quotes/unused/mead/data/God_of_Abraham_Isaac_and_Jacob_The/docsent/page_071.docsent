   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Sign Lameness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jacob was touched by God in the hollow of his thigh at Peniel, and his leg was crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when they experience it, they do not know what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After a few months or a few years God may show them that He was dealing with their natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then they will realize that they have passed through such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that just because you are exuberant when you pray, your natural life has been dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is wrong to think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our experience tells us that we do not know when God deals with our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But one thing we do know: Whenever we are touched by the Lord, we are no longer free in our walk; we are no longer as convenient as before.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is a big mark in us lameness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lameness is a sign that our natural life has been touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not a matter of testifying in a certain meeting that God dealt with our natural life on a certain date.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a matter of our legs becoming crippled through some spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Originally, the more we contrived, the more we enjoyed our contriving.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But once we have been touched, something will vacillate within us when we contrive again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can no longer contrive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The minute we try, we lose our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Originally, we were so capable of speaking about this and that kind of thing; we had lofty words and high sounding phrases.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But even before the words come out of our mouth now, we feel sick about them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can no longer be as glib as before.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Originally we were shrewd and resourceful; we knew what to do about this person and what to do about that person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was no need for us to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after God has touched our natural life, we will feel that something within is gone when we try to supplant others; something within us wilts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not saying that we should not act wisely.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God often will lead us to do wise things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if we try to exercise our own maneuvering, we will feel that something has collapsed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We will feel this way before we even try to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that the hollow of our thigh has been touched.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who have passed through God's dealings know the difference between natural strength and spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After a person's natural strength is fully stripped, he will be afraid of the resurgence of his natural strength whenever he works for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We know that we will obtain a certain kind of result if we say a certain word, but we are afraid of reaping that result.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we go on according to our natural strength, we will feel cold inside, and something within us will refuse to go along.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the meaning of lameness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is also a difference in degree as to how much a person is touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some are touched by God just to the extent that their conscience is bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some are touched by God in a thorough way; they are touched in the sinew of their thigh hollow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These people are the truly crippled ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has to do a thorough work in us until a life-long mark is left on us, a mark of lameness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After we become crippled, something will hurt us and frustrate us whenever we try to move or do something.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the mark of being touched by God.</S>
