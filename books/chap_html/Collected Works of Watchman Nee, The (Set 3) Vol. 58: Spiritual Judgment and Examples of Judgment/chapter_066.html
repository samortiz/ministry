<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(62)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 21, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER S. M.</h2><p>I became a Christian at the age of seventeen. In my youth I was always sick. I was married in Luo-Yang and met with the local church in Sian. At that time I was very seeking. I dealt with sins and also experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. I consecrated myself to the Lord and my whole family eventually was saved. Once, I became sick during a period of darkness, and I asked God to take me away. Later, my husband and I mutually confessed our sins. The next day the swelling in my stomach left, and I recovered gradually.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Being Enlarged by the Cross</h2><p>Our sister has not learned many lessons, because her years in the Lord are short. She is not very experienced. Both the work of the cross and the discipline of the Spirit are for the purpose of enlarging man's capacity before God. The cross can enlarge man's capacity. We are narrow because we experience little working of the cross. The more the cross works on us, the more our measure is enlarged, and the more we are willing to deny ourselves and all that we have. We know that the Lord's heart is large. Through His cross man's heart can also be enlarged beyond measure. As soon as a man touches the cross, he begins to be enlarged. He can even pray for his own enemies. Those who can pray for their enemies are enlarged. The cross can enlarge a person and make his heart as large as the heart of the crucified Lord. The more crosses a person receives, the more he is enlarged. The fact that Stephen was able to pray for his enemies proves that he was enlarged by the cross. The cross was manifested in him as much as it was manifested in Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Accepting God's Arrangements</h2><p>Our sister prayed for death. She also prayed for repentance, for recovery, and for healing. A person prays for death only because he does not appreciate the environment that God has arranged. He despises and hates God's arrangement, and he is disappointed by it. You are not willing to accept God's arrangement and are disappointed by it. This is the reason you prayed for death. Please remember that this is not a matter of right and wrong. It is a sign that speaks of your hidden rejection of God's right. It speaks of a secret, rebellious spirit, a disobedient will. We should learn to bow our heads before God and submit to all of His arrangements. When we find God's arrangement different from our will, we should ask for grace to appreciate it. Although what happened to you is over, you should find out why these things came upon you. A Christian should learn to kiss the hand that orders his environment. We become disappointed when we encounter many things that we dislike and are unable to change them. When God orders such circumstances for us, we should learn submission. We have to know that many things are impossible with man, but all things are possible with God. We have to learn to trust and obey.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Careful and Serious</h2><p>Our sister's speaking gave me the impression that she is not a careful person. Her testimony and prayer show that she is not that concerned with small details. She is careless, unfocused, and unconcerned about many things. I hope that our sister will receive mercy. A sister should be careful and serious. She should not be negligent or sloppy in anything before the Lord, and she should consider everything in a sober way. Everything that you do should be done to God, not to those around you, such as your husband and children. We live before God. Our immediate relationship is not with man, but with God. Men may excuse us for many things, but we should be sober before God concerning these things. Careless persons are off in the eyes of God. Our walk and our living are before God. Men may let us get by with many things, but we have to seek to walk perfectly before God. God told Abraham to be perfect before Him. Our God is a God of perfection. Perhaps this is what you need. You have to accept God's arrangements, and you have to be more sober in your living. You should no longer be careless or sloppy. Otherwise, your daily life will affect your Christian life.</p>
