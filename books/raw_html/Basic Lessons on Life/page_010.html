<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Two Trees, Indicating Two Wills, Two Sources,<br>and Two Possibilities for Man to Choose</H2><P>God putting man before two trees indicates that man had a free will. The two trees show that in this universe there are two wills, two sources, and two possibilities for man to choose. God put man before the two trees in a neutral position. This indicates that man surely by that time had a strong free will; otherwise, God would not have put him in front of two choices.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being Charged to Eat the Right Tree,<br>Indicating That God Created for Man a Free Will<br>and That God Wanted Man to Exercise<br>His Free Will to Choose Him</H2><P>After God put man in front of two choices, God warned man not to choose the wrong tree and charged him to eat the right tree (Gen. 2:16-17). This indicated that God created for man a free will and that God wanted man to exercise his free will to choose Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. GOD'S PROHIBITING MAN FROM EATING THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE INDICATING THAT GOD WANTED MAN TO RECEIVE HIM AS LIFE BY ENJOYING HIM</H2><P>God's prohibiting man from eating the tree of knowledge indicates that God wanted man to receive Him as life by enjoying Him (John 1:11-12; Col. 2:6). To eat is a matter of enjoyment. God wanted man to receive Him in the way of joy, in the way of enjoyment, not in any other way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. MAN NEEDING TO BE<br>GOD'S VESSEL TO CONTAIN HIM</H2><P>Man has to be the vessel of God to contain Him. This is the concluding emphasis of this message. To emphasize this we should use Ephesians 3:17a&#151;"that Christ may make His home in your hearts." We have to tell the saints that a home is a big vessel. All the dwellers are contained in their dwelling places. The house contains us. Thus, we have to be God's vessels to contain God.</P><P>In the book of Ephesians, Paul strongly charged us to be the home of Christ. He desired to see that Christ might make His home in our hearts that we might be His real vessels. The teachings in Christianity miss this. They stress many other ethical things, but not the point that we have to let the Lord make His home in our hearts that we may be His vessels to contain Him. The focus of this message should be man being God's container.</P>
