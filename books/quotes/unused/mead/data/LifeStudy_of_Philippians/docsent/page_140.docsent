   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING A CONSTANT SALVATION TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many of us have been Christians for years, but we have never heard anything about this constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We knew, of course, about eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That kind of salvation is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I wish to make it very clear that I certainly do not belittle eternal salvation in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I treasure it and deeply appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In His eternal salvation God has rescued us from hell and from His righteous judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But day by day we need to go on to experience a constant salvation in our practical life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Paul was in prison, what he enjoyed was not simply God s eternal salvation with the hope it afforded him; he also enjoyed a constant salvation hour by hour.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To enjoy this salvation is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually to live Christ is to enjoy constant salvation in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every aspect of God s salvation brings us out of something on the negative side and ushers us into something on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Negatively, Paul was saved from being put to shame; positively, Christ was magnified in him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What a wonderful salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>SAVED FROM ORDINARY THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 2:12 Paul tells the saints in Philippi, Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The constant salvation in 1:19 is for a particular person in a particular situation, whereas the constant salvation in 2:12 is for all believers in common situations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have seen that the salvation in 1:19 saved Paul in the particular situation of his imprisonment in such a way that he would not be put to shame, but instead would magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we need to see that, according to the context of 2:12, constant salvation is also for the believers to be saved from ordinary things in their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From verses 14 and 15 we see that these things include murmurings, reasonings, blame, guile, blemishes, crookedness, perverseness, and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are general characteristics of the condition of fallen man everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No matter where we may be, there will be murmuring, reasoning, blame, guile, blemishes, crookedness, perverseness, and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These may be found not only in society generally, but even in the family life of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is common for wives to murmur, and for husbands to reason.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A wife may complain about something, and her husband may vindicate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then neither the wife nor the husband is blameless, and both may also have guile and blemishes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At times, a husband and wife are also crooked and perverted in their dealings with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Who can say that he has never been crooked in his relationships with others?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Children may even be crooked in relation to their own parents.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we have received God s eternal salvation, to a certain extent we may still be crooked, not altogether honest and straightforward in certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, we need a constant salvation with respect to all the negative things in verses 14 and 15.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul tells us that we need to work out our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By working out this salvation we shall be saved from murmurings, reasonings, blame, guile, blemishes, crookedness, perverseness, and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be sure, it is not easy to be saved from such things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul deliberately used these words to indicate the fallen condition common to all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>HOLDING FORTH THE WORD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, just as the salvation in 1:19 has both a negative side and a positive side, the salvation in 2:12 has two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The negative side is in verses 14 and 15; the positive side is in verse 16, where Paul speaks of holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Greek word rendered holding forth means to apply, present, offer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To hold forth the word of life is to present it to others and offer it to them, applying it to them in their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Wherever we may be, we need to hold forth the word of life; we need to present the word of life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What we offer to those around us should not be words of murmuring or reasoning, nor anything related to crookedness or perverseness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should offer nothing other than the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To hold forth the word of life is identical to living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever we live Christ, we hold forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once again we see that the book of Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ and a book also on living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What Paul wrote in this Epistle is related to the experience of Christ and to living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope that we all shall be deeply impressed with the need to enjoy constant salvation in our practical life day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need a salvation which we can term our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This salvation saves us not from hell, nor even merely from sin, but from murmurings, reasonings, blame, guile, blemishes, crookedness, perverseness, and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we experience this salvation, we spontaneously hold forth, present, apply, the word of life to those around us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is to live Christ.</S>
