<H1 CLASS=TITLE>RUNNING THE RACE THAT IS<br>SET BEFORE US</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 26</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Heb. 12:1-3</H1><P>Hebrews 11 mentions Abel, Enoch, and many other men of old and tells us how they did many things "by faith." What does this mean? Here we are shown one very important thing that is indispensable to every Christian. This is faith. In 2:3, it mentions "so great a salvation." This salvation is not the initial salvation; it refers to the entrance into Canaan, which is the entrance into the kingdom with the Son of God. In this kingdom we reign with Christ. This is the gospel of the kingdom.</P><P>God puts two things before man. First, He puts eternal life before the sinner. Second, He puts the kingdom before the man who has obtained eternal life. He who believes has eternal life. However, "unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens" (Matt. 5:20). "Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens" (Matt. 7:21). From these two verses we can see that obtaining eternal life only requires our believing, but there are other qualifications for entering into the kingdom.</P><P>Once a man is saved, God puts him into a race. The entire Christian life is a race. This race is not for obtaining eternal life. On the contrary, only those who already have eternal life are qualified to run the race. At the end of the race, some will receive a crown, while others will not receive a crown (1 Cor. 9:24-25).</P><P>What is a crown? A crown represents a kingdom. A crown is the symbol of kingship, reigning, and glory. Receiving the crown means to obtain the kingdom, which is to become kings to reign and receive glory with the Lord Jesus. Not receiving the crown means missing the kingdom, and failing to reign, rule, and receive glory with the Lord Jesus. The crown is the symbol of the kingdom. There is no problem with a Christian obtaining eternal life. However, his obtaining of the kingdom depends on how he runs the race.</P><P>After a man is saved, God puts him in a race which is aimed directly at the kingdom. All his words, conduct, thoughts, living, and everything about him have to do with whether or not he will obtain the kingdom in the future. Those who do not join the race have judged themselves unworthy of obtaining the kingdom. Those who do not run the race properly have delayed their obtaining of the kingdom. God has already put every Christian on this way. Whether or not we will obtain the kingdom depends on us. Our abandon, consecration, faithfulness, and victory will make us those that receive the crown. But those who desire the world and walk according to their flesh will see that although they have eternal life through the Lord Jesus, the kingdom of heaven is still not theirs.</P><P>What are the "witnesses" mentioned in Hebrews 12:1? Apparently, it refers to those who have great faith as mentioned in chapter eleven. Actually, it does not refer to the people themselves but to the things they did. The word witness is the same in the original language as in Acts 1:8 and 2:32. The Word of God tells us that the witnesses of the things done by those people are like a great cloud surrounding us.</P><P>What do these many witnesses witness? They witness to God's "great salvation" (Heb. 2:3-4). This great salvation is not only the forgiveness of sins but obtaining the kingdom. The kingdom is the goal of our race. God gave us so many witnesses for the purpose of encouraging us to live a life of faith so that we can run the race and receive the glory of the kingdom. Although the great men of faith in chapter eleven did not have the kingdom directly as their object of faith, their faith was nevertheless their race. For them to believe so recklessly was a kind of laying aside of everything for the running of the race. Apparently, they obtained what they believed in; some were raptured, some obtained the land, some were resurrected, and some were saved from perishing. But these things are not God's ultimate promise to them. What they had obtained through faith was only their earnest, proving that they would obtain the promised kingdom of God. "And these all, having obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not obtain the promise, because God has provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect" (Heb. 11:39-40). What is this talking about? It is about the kingdom. They had obtained the earnest, and this earnest is God's assurance to them that they would obtain the kingdom in the future.</P><P>"So great a cloud of witnesses," is the grace given by God through the faith of many people. God answered their prayers and worked miracles; He proved that their running of the race was well-pleasing to Him and that they would possess the kingdom. Since we have all these witnesses, we should run the race of faith.</P><P>God has put the kingdom before us, and He has given us a race to run. At the end of the race, we will see if we have failed or won. The winner will reign with the Lord, while the loser, though saved, will have nothing to do with the glory of the kingdom.</P><P>The race is already set, and those who want to run have to "put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us." There are two crucial things in running a race. First, we have to lay aside every weight, and second, we have to put away our sin.</P>
