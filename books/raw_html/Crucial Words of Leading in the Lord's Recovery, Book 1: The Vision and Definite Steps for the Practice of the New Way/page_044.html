<h2 class="head1">WHAT IS THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Word Being the Track</h2>
<p>God is certainly a wise God. Had there not been the Pentateuch at the time of Moses and had the other books of the Bible not been written, we would not have the Bible today, and the world would be in an unimaginably fallen state. We thank the Lord that no matter how much human history has been on a downward path and no matter how fallen Christianity has become, we still have the Bible. The Bible is a lamp in the darkness and a light for the world that shines in the dark age. The Bible is also like a track laid before men, leading men to the right path. Although men can choose whether or not to take the track, the track is nevertheless there.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Work of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery<br />
versus Degraded Christianity</h2>
<p>Degradation has no bottom to it. Not only are the world and humanity degrading day by day; even Christianity has become an ever-degrading religion. Its trend is forever downward. Nevertheless, the Lord has had His recovery throughout the ages. He has continued to raise up many groups of lovers of Jesus. In the Old Testament, Elijah was zealous for the Lord, and he was persecuted by Jezebel. He became afraid and was discouraged to the point that he ran far away and asked to be allowed to die under a broom shrub. However, an angel strengthened him, and he walked forty days to Mount Horeb, where God appeared to him. He began to accuse the Israelites by saying, &ldquo;The children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, thrown down Your altars, and slain Your prophets with the sword; and I alone am left, and they seek to take my life&rdquo; (1 Kings 19:10). God answered him as if to say, &ldquo;Elijah, do not accuse the Israelites before Me. You are wrong. You are not the only one left. I have reserved for Myself seven thousand who have not bowed unto Baal and have not kissed him&rdquo; (cf. v. 18).</p>
<p>I say this to remind you that not only at the time of Elijah, but after his time and throughout church history, God has reserved for His own name &ldquo;seven thousand&rdquo; people, even during the darkest hour of the church&rsquo;s degradation. A number of people have written books on church history. The best one is by a Brethren scholar by the name of Edmund Hamer Broadbent. His book, <em>The Pilgrim Church,</em> is written with keen spiritual insight. It is a church history with the highest discernment. He traces the line from the time of the apostles to the present age, identifying those &ldquo;seven thousand...all the knees that have not bowed unto Baal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have no intention to be proud, but we must say that since sixty years ago, when we were raised up by the Lord in China, we have had this burden and desire within us. We have told the Lord, &ldquo;We would be the &lsquo;seven thousand&rsquo; which You have reserved for Your own name in this age.&rdquo; What is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? Strictly speaking, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the Lord&rsquo;s reserving &ldquo;seven thousand&rdquo; for His name. Because we have adopted this attitude and taken this ground, our actions and behavior have been a cause for some misunderstanding by others. We are misunderstood by society and by our relatives and friends. We do not follow tradition, and we do not even follow religion. Religion is going downward, while the recovery is going upward. Within three to five years after the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States, Christianity began to oppose us. This does not mean that the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is wrong. The truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can be compared to pure gold. Pure gold does not fear the fire, and the more it is beaten, the more it shines. The real reason behind the opposition is that it is easy to flow downstream and difficult to go upstream.</p>
<p>I am a small Chinese man, not worthy of attention. Before I was fifty I had never traveled to the West and had never been in the United States. Yet for the sake of the defense of the truth we hold among us, I was forced to resort to the law of America; I was forced to appeal to &ldquo;Caesar,&rdquo; the United States Constitution. More than two hundred sixty publications throughout the fifty states of the United States rose up to attack this little, insignificant Chinese man. What is the reason behind this? It is because a little Chinese man has dared to blow the trumpet in the face of the colossus of American Christianity. However, the truth is the truth. The Lord covers me with His blood. This great Christianity could do nothing to me because I was walking absolutely according to the truth and according to the law. Since the 1960s there have been rumors about me in Christianity, and anonymous letters even came to me in a plot against me, accusing me of being a Communist. Some even stirred up the Federal Bureau of Investigation to make an inquiry concerning me. I was not afraid of these things because I had done nothing against my conscience. I was not worried that I would be put to shame by the law. I cooperated with the investigations, and in the end it was proven where I stand.</p>
