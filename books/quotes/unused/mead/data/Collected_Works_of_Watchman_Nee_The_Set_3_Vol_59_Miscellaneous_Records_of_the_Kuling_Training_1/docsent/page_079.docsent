   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL'S THOUGHTS BEING CAPTURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul, who was Saul, was an intelligent, clever, and rational person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was very resourceful, and he served God with his own zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On his way to Damascus to arrest Christians, he met a great light and fell to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From that day forward, he was stripped of his own proposals and ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He asked, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He no longer wanted to do anything by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once he met the great light, he became foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He no longer had any plans or proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>May the Lord give us such "foolishness," a "foolishness" that results from enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Light not only humbles us but silences us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once a man touches God's authority and sees His light, he does not have to suppress his words or muzzle his proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Spontaneously his cleverness, concepts, and suggestions are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is conscious of his captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is brought to the obedience and rule of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>EXAMPLES OF REBELLION IN THOUGHTS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us consider some Old Testament examples of thoughts that were not taken captive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First we have Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their sin was different from the sins of others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Others sinned by indulging in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nadab and Abihu sinned in the matter of serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They proposed something by themselves and offered strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They did not subject themselves to their father's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, they made proposals on their own and offered sacrifices with their censers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their sin was an offense against God and against His minister.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They thought that they were doing a good thing, but they actually were offering incense according to their own conviction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They thought they were rendering service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They thought that even if they were wrong, their mistake would fall within the realm of divine service.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They thought that it was serious and fatal to commit worldly sins but that it was minor and inconsequential to commit mistakes in God's service.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Little did they realize that God immediately rejected them and sentenced them to death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their actions were the result of their runaway thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They had their own ideas about divine service, and the result was terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Consider the case of King Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was rejected because he kept the best of the sheep and oxen for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He considered it a waste to destroy these choice goods.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was not rejected because he stole, robbed, or extorted from the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had many reasons and ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He wanted to offer these as sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He wanted to please God in his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a man has not touched authority, his thoughts will always be a problem to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not a matter of whether or not one has the desire to serve the Lord, but a matter of the means he uses to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He should not think that he can act according to his own will as long as he has a desire to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is where many people stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In God's service no one can propose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is the One who proposes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even if He appoints us to be a king, He does not want us to make any proposal of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He only wants us to be an executor of His order and His will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is wrong for us to think that we can tell others what to do just because we have been appointed by God to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should have only one aspiration, which is to find out what God wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God says that obedience is better than sacrifice and taking heed better than the fat of rams.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Saul did not realize that he had no right to propose anything to God; he had no right to make suggestions to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man can only say, "Lord, what do You want me to do?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your servant is listening."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our place is in the dust and among the footstools.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Saul saw the excellent and fat livestock and thought it a waste to destroy them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He wanted to save them and offer them to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Would it not be much better to save them?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Saul had a heart to serve God; he had a heart to make sacrifices, but he did not have a heart to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather than offering everything to the Lord, it is better for him to say, "Lord, I dare not make any proposals or suggestions of my own; I want to obey You in everything."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No oblation of fat or offering of fragrance can take the place of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the end Samuel told Saul, "Because you have rejected the word of Jehovah,/He has also rejected you from being king" 1 Sam 15:23b .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord ordered Saul to destroy the Amalekites and all their livestock, but Saul did not want to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Ultimately, a young Amalekite killed Saul 2 Sam 1:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God wanted Saul to destroy all the Amalekites, but he would not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the end he was killed by an Amalekite, and his reign ended.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a serious thing.</S>
