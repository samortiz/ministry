   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT BUILT BY MERE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The same principle applies to the matter of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians today think that since they have certain gifts, they are quite spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In fact, however, this is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we read 1 Corinthians, we can see the condition of the Corinthian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They exercised the gifts very much, but did they have the real growth of life?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No, they were fleshly and childish 3:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Just as the teachings should be the means to convey Christ to others, so also the gifts should be the means only to convey Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s intention today is not to give us many teachings and gifts but to minister and impart Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I once met a person who was full of the knowledge of the Bible, but although he spoke concerning the Bible, he still had the habit of smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After speaking on the book of Matthew and the ten virgins for half an hour, he said, Excuse me; I need to smoke a little.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I know this is wrong, but I am weak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then he went into the book of Revelation and spoke of the ten horns, the seven heads, and the forty-two months.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He had the strength to teach, but eventually he had to say, Excuse me, I need to smoke a little more.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Though he was strong in Bible teaching, he was very weak in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I also saw many people who spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the demonstration of this gift, they were very careless in their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some were even more careless than unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was easy for them to lose their temper at home.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All these things simply prove one thing: that God s intention is not to give us teachings and gifts but to give us Christ, the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God uses teachings, when ministered in a proper way, to convey Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes He uses certain gifts as the means to minister Christ to us and to stir up people to receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we all must realize that God s intention is that we know the living One, the Triune God, and experience Christ in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Old Testament a donkey once spoke in a human language Num 22:21-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was a genuine speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I doubt whether all the tongues are as genuine today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I read an article recently in which the writer reported that he had contacted more than one hundred persons who spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He said that every one without exception doubted whether the tongue he spoke was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet the writer still encouraged people not to doubt but to continue their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After I read that, I said to myself, At the time of Pentecost, did Peter doubt whether the tongue he spoke was genuine?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Was there anyone at that time who had such doubts?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But today, why do so many people question whether or not their tongue is genuine?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The simple answer is that many tongues today are not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even if you are speaking a genuine tongue, I must tell you that tongue-speaking is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even King Saul received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit 1 Sam 19:22-24 , but we should not think that he experienced life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the contrary, his experience simply exposed him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After he received the outpouring of the Spirit, he made himself naked.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This illustrates that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is different from life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Life is not the outpouring of the Spirit; rather, life is only Christ Himself in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am not trying to criticize, but my burden is very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I see the desperate situation of the Lord s people, I do not know what to say or what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Christians hear sound Bible teachings, they are very responsive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When they hear of spiritual gifts, many are stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when the inner life and the indwelling Christ are ministered, how great is their need for an inner revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The doctrines and the gifts are outward, but Christ is hidden within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How the Lord s people need to know Christ as the indwelling One, who is living and powerful converting, regulating, strengthening, refreshing, and always transforming and saturating us!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>NOT BUILT BY POSITION</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must also see that the building of the church is not a matter of position or responsibility but a matter of life in our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not a matter of putting someone into a position, but a matter of the growth of the inner life unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our inner being must be constituted with God through His inward working.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we put people into a position, the more we will have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the more we help people to realize the growth in life, the more life will multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The growth of the inner life is the sure way of building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then through the matured life we will spontaneously be qualified to exercise responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Again we need to repeat: God s intention is to impart Christ into us and make Christ everything within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God uses teachings to help some people, and He uses the gifts to help others, but these are not the main thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Inner revelation is needed to see the goal of the living Christ dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we see this goal, wherever we meet together, we will be the living house of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The living God will dwell, live, and work in us, and we will bear the testimony of Jesus, who is the reality of the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then we will be the genuine manifestation of the living God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the way of God s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Let us look to the Lord for the inner grace that we may have the reality of the church.</S>
