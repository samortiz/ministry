        <h2 class="head1">PRAYING AND BLENDING IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God is a fountain within us, but we have not dug deeply enough for the living water to spring forth. We have not been taught sufficiently to exercise our spirit. Just as our mind needs to be trained in order for us to function, our spirit also needs to be trained.</p>
<p>Although the immeasurable Spirit is in our spirit, we do not apply Him. We are saved, and our spirit has been enlivened, but we are not accustomed to exercising our spirit. We like to engage in physical and mental activities, but we do not enjoy exercising our spirit. We are like children who enjoy playing but do not like to study. Many saints do not like to exercise their spirit. They like to clean the meeting hall and even to attend conferences or Bible studies, but they do not like to be calm in order to touch, exercise, and release their spirit. Since we began fellowshipping concerning blending in spirit, some saints have stopped coming to the meetings. In the past they attended meetings in order to hear a message, but now those who come to the meetings must pray and blend in spirit. Hence, the saints who are not accustomed to exercising their spirit feel uncomfortable in the meetings.</p>
<p>The saints feel uncomfortable because they do not like to exercise their spirit. We like to do things and listen to messages, but we do not like to exercise our spirit. May the Lord be merciful to us and revolutionize our concept so that we would pay attention to blending in spirit by prayer. This kind of prayer is to dig the well. When we dig deeply enough, the Spirit as the living water will spontaneously flow out.</p>
<p>To blend in spirit is to exercise and release one&rsquo;s spirit in prayer with others. Every believer has been enlivened in his spirit, and the Spirit of God dwells in his spirit. Hence, we need to exercise our spirit. We should not be persons who only like activities that involve our body and our soul. We should exercise our spirit in all that we do. Moreover, our spirit should blend with the spirit of the other saints in our activities and in prayer. Blending in spirit is not momentary or seasonal; it is continual.</p>
<p>While the children of Israel journeyed through the wilderness, they came to a place called Beer, where there was no water for drinking. So they used the scepter and staffs to dig the well while they sang, &ldquo;Spring up, O well!&rdquo; (Num. 21:16-18). Our blending in spirit by praying is our digging the well so that our spirit can flow forth with living water. In order to build the church, our spirit must be living and strong. Whether or not the church can be built up depends on how much we are blended in spirit.</p>
<p>Although we received this light several years ago and saw the need for the spirit of the saints to be strong, we did not see its importance as clearly as we do today. In order for the church to be built, the church must be a priesthood. The priests are a group of people who burn the incense by praying in spirit. The focus of their function is not the bronze altar with the offerings but their entering into the Holy Place to light the lamps and to burn incense at the incense altar. Lighting the lamps signifies reading the Word, and burning the incense signifies praying. Every time we fellowship with God, we need to light the lamps and burn the incense. In other words, we need to read the Word and pray.</p>
<p>When we pray, we let the Spirit pass through us. The Spirit cannot flow through a person who never prays. The Spirit can flow in us and out of us only through our prayer. It does not matter how many messages we have heard; if we do not turn the messages into prayer, they will not have any effect on us. The same applies to our reading the Bible. If we read the Bible without praying, the words in the Bible will merely be letters related to knowledge, which will remain in our mind and will not become the bread of life, the light of life, and the Spirit of life to be the supply in our spirit. Hence, in addition to listening to messages and reading the Bible, we must pray.</p>
<p>The desolation of the church is due to a lack of prayer. Before the children of Israel became desolate, the prophethood was not manifest. Moses was a prophet, but his primary function was to represent God as His deputy among the people of Israel. Aaron&rsquo;s function was to serve as a priest to God. At the time of David and when Solomon built the temple, there were kings and priests ministering before God.</p>
<p>Later, the condition of the Israelites deteriorated to the point that during the reign of King Ahab, there were idols in their midst. In 1 Kings 18 and 19, the kings were improper, and the priests were nowhere to be found. However, the prophets, such as Elijah and Elisha, were prominent. In degraded Christianity the believers are not exercising God&rsquo;s authority as kings, nor are they ministering to God as priests. Instead, there are pastors giving sermons; in other words, only a few serve as prophets. Even our situation has degraded to the point of the churches depending on the ministers of the word. The meetings consist mainly of ones giving messages and of others listening to messages; very few saints pray as priests.</p>
<p>I am burdened that the Lord would balance us so that we would pay as much attention to prayer as we do to listening to messages. Otherwise, the messages that we hear will remain in our mind. We must see that God&rsquo;s intention is for every believer to be a priest. The church has fallen to the extent that only a few minister as priests. We must recover the prayer of the priests so that the church can be built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING BY EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The saints must pay attention to the service of the priests and rise up to minister to God. To minister in this way is to exercise our spirit to pray so that our spirit and the Spirit are mingled as one. Then God can flow through us and be transmitted through us to supply others. There has been a great deal of blending in spirit among the co-workers and the leading ones. I hope that this blending will be strengthened. It must not be seasonal. This requires us to exercise and practice daily. The more our spirit is exercised, the stronger, richer, and fresher it will be, and the more we will be able to enliven the saints.</p>
<p>I hope that the leading ones will endeavor to lead the group meetings to practice blending in spirit. Then the leading ones can stir up the rest of the saints to blend in spirit. If we exercise and practice according to what the Lord has shown us, the saints will be uplifted and living, the priesthood will be manifested among us, and we will be blended in spirit and built together to be the dwelling place of God in spirit. This is the miniature expression of the New Jerusalem on the earth today. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
