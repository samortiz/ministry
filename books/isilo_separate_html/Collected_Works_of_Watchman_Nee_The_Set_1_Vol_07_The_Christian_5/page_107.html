Hence, we need to say a few words to the brothers and sisters in the big family of The Christian.</P><P>When we first began publication of The Christian, our original intention was to try it for only one year. While, on the one hand, there are not many spiritual publications today, on the other hand, there are enough to make us wonder whether there was sufficient need for us to publish The Christian. Yet, since its inception, readers everywhere have indicated that it does meet a great need in the church today and has its unique place. Their subscriptions, recommendations, and encouragements have been continually pouring in. We thank God that He has made The Christian so acceptable to His children. We intend therefore to continue the work for another year.</P><P>In publishing this little paper The Christian, in addition to difficulties with material, time, and energy, there is another problem that we feel reluctant to handle. The one thing that we fear the most is to be involved in debates. All of you know that in the present churches there are many theological arguments and variations in expositions. There are even more sectarian traditions and denominational systems. What we believe in and preach is nothing other than the Bible. We do not want to adopt anything from human tradition. But to adopt such a stand in publishing a paper will undoubtedly invite many debates and arguments. This is why during the past year, other than quoting directly from the Bible, we dared not discuss many things. Even when we made any conclusions, we dared not judge presumptuously, thus causing sorrow to those of God's children who hold different views than we do. At the beginning of this year, we would like to declare specifically that what we want to do the most is to proclaim to our readers the teachings in the Bible. But we want to proclaim them in the spirit of peace so that those brothers and sisters who hold different views will not be offended. St. Augustine said, "In primary things, be one; in secondary things, be liberal; and in all things, love."</P><P>When we published our first issue of The Christian, we included a statement stating our goal, standard, and affiliation. We would now like to reprint what we said then:</P><P>Goal: In this little monthly publication our desire is to supply spiritual milk to the young believers and solid food to the older ones. We especially stress the salvation of the cross. But we are even more concerned with the spiritual condition of the believers. We ask God to strengthen us that we could preach all of God's will. As to the errors of modernism, we will strive to warn God's children of its dangers.</P><P>Standard: The Bible is our only standard. We are not afraid to preach the pure Word of the Bible, even if men oppose; but if it is not the Word of the Bible, we could never agree even if everyone approved.</P><P>Affiliation: We are not affiliated with any church; rather, we publish this paper by the Lord's strengthening. Recently, indigenous churches have become a current topic of advocacy. But we feel that God's will is to bring us back to the conditions and ways of the first century's apostles. Therefore, with regard to the question of the church, we are specifically preaching it with the goal of the New Testament in view, and we are not controlled by any sect.</P><P>This statement was published in the first issue of this paper. By the grace of God we have not changed our original intention, and this year we will surely carry on according to this statement.</P><P>On the one hand, we desire to preach the true word of God, but on the other hand, we do not wish to hurt the good feelings of other children of God. Please remember that, though you may find some views in The Christian different from yours, we should never be divided because of this. This is even more so with regard to the question of sectarianism. We desire that all the children of God be united as one. Except for reason of extreme importance, we are most reluctant to publish any writings that would cause disputation.</P><P>According to the teaching of the Bible, all should discern when the prophets speak (1 Cor. 14:29). We believe that none of the world's best expositions were written under such inspiration as that of the Bible. Men invariably make mistakes. It cannot be that The Christian will never err. (Of course, we would never intentionally put errors into it.) However, if what The Christian teaches are teachings of the Bible and not teachings of men, nor of denominations, nor of theology, then please do not refuse them because of inconvenience. But if they are not the teachings of the Bible, please reject them. However, we must bear in mind this one thing: we should not annul the many "truly, truly's" in the Bible with one "perhaps," nor oppose the many clearly manifest teachings of the Scriptures with one or two ambiguous verses that are dependent entirely on interpretations.</P><P>In the November issue of last year, we have asked for suggestions from the readers concerning the "Exposition Issues" of this magazine. Many brothers and sisters have advised that we continue with it. We will quote one letter from Pastor Tsui Ai-kwang from Chen-yang-kwan, Anhwei:</P><P>"...Concerning the question of the `Exposition Issues,' I have found that I received more help from that than from the other issues. According to my personal experience, I think it should surely continue...."</P><P>This letter represents the desire of many readers. For this reason, this year we hope to continue publishing the "Exposition Issues." But for various reasons, we cannot publish six issues as we did last year. Most likely this year we will put out one issue per two months. While I am writing this, the section on Thyatira in the "Meditations on Revelation" is ready for printing.</P><P>The contents of The Christian this year will continue as before. Besides "The Signs of the Times," "Stories," and "Question and Answer Box," all of which were included last year, we have also prepared three articles on "The Paths to Hell" for this year's gospel messages (the first of which is published in this issue). Other articles which also proclaim the gospel of the grace of God will be published in succession. All our readers may feel free to pass on the gospel messages to others (whether or not you mention the name of this magazine). There is a certain pastor who regularly reads the gospel messages of this paper to his congregation on Sundays. He feels that even though they cannot hear our preaching personally, he still can use this direct method to meet the need. The Lord has greatly blessed what he has done.</P><P>This year there will be many messages especially dealing with faith in the "Spiritual Teachings" column. The articles on prayer by Mr. Meek will still be published. We also hope to print some practical articles written by other children of God. In the first half of this year, we intend to publish "Faith in Practice," "The Source of Faith," "Essentials and Nonessentials," "The Condescension of the Lord Jesus," "Bribing the Conscience," and others. "An Hour's Conversation with Mr. George Muller" has been translated by Mr. Wang Tze and will be published in the "Testimonies" column. The Lord willing, Mr. Wang will translate other articles for us. "A Sermon that Was Never Delivered" in the "Stories" column is the most touching one. We also hope to publish some testimonies of high school and college students this year. Please pay attention to them.</P><P>We have translated "The Origin of the Bible" and hope to publish it soon.</P><P>Concerning the exposition of the Bible, we will continue "Meditations on Genesis." However, each article will be a separate entity. The sixth and seventh articles have been completed. One is "The Story of Creation and the Truth concerning the Dispensations," and the other is "The Story of Creation and the Seven Great Characters of Genesis." Those who enjoy reading this column will receive much spiritual food.</P><P>Naturally, there is much which we cannot say now, but we will do our best to make The Christian a work which glorifies God and benefits men. We still ask you to continue praying for us so that in our work we can feel the power of your supplications. We still hope that you would not forget to introduce The Christian to others. You may think that this is an insignificant thing to do, but if everyone would do this, this paper will benefit much. May God bless our work this year. How happy we are when we consider that we can speak of His name to the world and to the saints for His sake!</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>January, 1927</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_106.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_108.html">Next</a> </body></html>
