<P>5)The Overcoming Life (1 John 5:12; Phil. 1:21).</P><P>6)The Normal Christian Life. This book contains messages on Romans 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12 given by Watchman Nee on his trip to Europe in 1938 and 1939. It was published in English and translated into Chinese.</P><P>7)A Two-sided Truth (Phil. 2:12-18). The twofoldness is this: On one hand God desires us to "work out" our salvation, and on the other hand, God "works in" us. We work out what God works within us.</P><P>8)Two Principles of Conduct (Gen. 2:9, 16-17). These are the principle of life and the principle of right or wrong. Christians should live by the first principle, not by the second.</P><P>9)In Christ (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 8:1-2; 2 Cor. 5:17; Col. 1:14; 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Cor. 1:2; Col. 2:10; Eph. 1:3; John 16:33; 2 Cor. 12:2). We Christians are persons in Christ, enjoying redemption, life, peace, victory, and all spiritual blessings in Him.</P><P>10)God's Masterpiece (Eph. 2:1-10). The believers are God's masterpiece in Christ through His death, resurrection, and ascension.</P><P>11)The New Covenant (Heb. 8:6, 8-13). The new covenant is a better covenant, enacted with the redeeming blood of Christ and guaranteed and executed by the resurrected Christ in His eternal priesthood according to the power of an indestructible life.</P><P>12)The Renewing of the Mind (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23). The believers' minds should be renewed that they may put off the old man and put on the new.</P><P>13)The Power of Resurrection (Phil. 3:10; Acts 2:32-33; Eph. 1:19-23; 2 Cor. 4:7). The power of resurrection is the power of the Holy Spirit, in which the believers live, work, and overcome, and by which the church is built up.</P><P>14)A Prayer for Revelation (Eph. 1:15-23). The apostle Paul prayed in Ephesians 1 for the believers to receive revelation concerning the hope of God's calling, the riches of the glory of God's inheritance in the saints, the greatness of His power to the believers, and the church as the Body, the fullness of Him that fills all in all.</P><P>15)Christ Is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. This book is composed of five chapters: 1) Christ as the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6); 2) Christ as the resurrection and the life (John 11:25); 3) Christ as the bread of life and the light of life (John 6:35; 8:12); 4) Christ as the "I Am" (John 8:24, 28, 58); and 5) Christ as the rock for the church (Matt. 16:16-18).</P>
