   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Tracts Enabling All Believers to Function</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The seventh advantage of tracts is that they enable all believers to function.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has given to the church apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although not everyone can be an apostle, everyone should do the work of an evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Under normal circumstances, everyone in the church should preach the gospel; everyone should function.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some may say that they do not have the eloquence or the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They may say that they cannot sing or preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But thank the Lord that everyone can pass out tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no distinction between tract distributors; a person who receives a tract does not care who he received it from.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In preaching the gospel and in giving a testimony, some are more gifted and powerful; their preaching brings more people to the knowledge of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Others are not as gifted and powerful; they bring fewer people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But tract distribution does not work this way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whether or not one is gifted or powerful, he can pass out tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether he is a child or an adult, an educated man or illiterate, he can pass out tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sphere becomes much larger.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anyone can do this as long as he is godly and dedicated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A businessman can invest a few dollars to print some tracts, round up some children, and go out with them to pass out these tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His work is different from the work of those preaching from the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The work of preaching is limited to a few brothers and sisters, but tract distribution is not restricted by this distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to help the distributors to realize that they have a share in God's service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their work is a great blessing to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way their hearts will be drawn to the church, and they will be burdened for the souls of men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No work can be as widespread as the work of tract distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>EXAMPLES OF MEN SAVING OTHERS WITH TRACTS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>AND BEING SAVED BY TRACTS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has used tracts to save many people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people are saved through reading tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can find many such testimonies, and many of them are quite miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I know that some people push tracts into others' homes through the front doors.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some put them in the mail boxes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some pass out tracts to pedestrians while walking on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A pedestrian once took a tract and tore it apart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another person picked up one of the torn pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The torn part spoke of escaping the wrath of the coming judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did not understand what he had read, but he felt uneasy about it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later he found the way to believe in the Lord, and he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A man once picked up a tract and immediately threw it away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Another person came along the same road.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was hurt by a nail which stuck into his shoe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To relieve his pain, he took the rejected tract, folded it, and put it inside his shoe as a cushion against the nail.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When he reached home, he took off his shoes and began to read the tract.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His reading brought him to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is what is meant by casting bread upon the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In time it will bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such an experience of salvation through tracts is extremely common and even amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the last century there was a preacher in England called Tusoney ?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>. He only had one lung, but he was very powerful in preaching the gospel, and many people were saved through him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He preached the gospel for thirty-seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was a common thing for him to speak to three or four thousand people in open air.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He prepared over a hundred different tracts for use in all the villages and towns of England.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some of them were for bigger cities, while others were for smaller villages.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some he used on a train or on a boat.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The result of these tracts was quite phenomenal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The tracts for trains alone totaled twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, one tract was entitled: "You Have a Ticket for the Train, but Do You Have Your Tract?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was used exclusively on trains.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once while he was on a train, as the train was pulling away from the station the conductor asked the passengers, "Do you have a ticket?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you do not have a ticket you cannot get on board."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This tract distributor went behind the conductor and said, "Do you have a tract?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you do not have a tract you cannot get on board."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On that day, seven people believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He printed the tracts, distributed them himself, and preached with them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Mr. George Cutting, the author of the book Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment, was very clear about the grace of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His little book ranks second in worldwide circulation, next only to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In his youth he was also a tract distributor.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord used him to write many tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He traveled all over England and did his best to save many people.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to tell the new ones these stories, and we have to encourage them to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Another person who belongs in this category is the author of the book A Christian's Rest.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His salvation was the result of four people receiving and passing on tracts consecutively.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The first one passed a tract to the second, who after being saved, passed another tract to the third.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the third was saved, he passed another tract to the fourth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All four were greatly used by the Lord in England.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They were all saved through another one giving them a tract.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>These tracts resulted in four great servants of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These examples show us the effectiveness of tracts.</S>
