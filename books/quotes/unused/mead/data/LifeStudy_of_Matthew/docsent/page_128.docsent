   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Priests Profaning the Sabbath</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>on the Sabbath in the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 5 the Lord asked the Pharisees, Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord brought to the attention of the Pharisees another case in the Scriptures to prove to them how little they really knew the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He pointed out that whatever the priests did in the temple on the Sabbath, they were guiltless.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Heavenly King Being Greater than the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in verse 6 the Lord declared, Now I say to you that a greater than the temple is here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What boldness the Lord had!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was a Nazarene, but as He stood before the Pharisees He seemed to be saying, Look at Me. I am greater than the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Pharisees must have been shocked to such an extent that they could not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord s revealing to the Pharisees that He was greater than the temple was another change, a type-fulfilling change from the temple to a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the case of David, it was a change from one age to another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this case, a case concerning the priests, it was a change from the temple to a Person who is greater than the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since the priests were guiltless in doing things on the Sabbath in the temple, how could the Lord s disciples be guilty in doing things on the Sabbath in Him who is greater than the temple?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the first case, it was the king breaking the Levitical regulation; in the second case, it was the priests breaking the sabbatical regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Scripture, neither was guilty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, what the Lord did here was scripturally right.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Apparently the priests were profaning the Sabbath, but actually they were not profaning the Sabbath, because they were in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In that sphere every day and everything were holy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Outside the temple everything was common.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But once something was brought into the temple, it was sanctified by the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, every day was sanctified by the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Outside the temple, there were common days and holy days, but within the temple there was no such distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything, every day, every matter, and everyone in the temple were holy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The temple, however, was a shadow, not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The reality is Christ, the greater temple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord seemed to be saying, I am the greater temple, the real temple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Me, Peter, John, and all the Galilean fishermen are sanctified, holy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Me every day is a holy day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the priests were free to move and engage in various activities on the Sabbath in the temple, then how much more can these dear ones freely do things within Me?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The temple protected the priests, and I, the greater temple, protect all My disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Pharisees, don t bother Me. Let My disciples be free, for they are all in the greater temple.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was a change from the type to the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s defense was too deep for the Pharisees to argue with.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They had nothing with which to counter the Lord s defense.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, they were silent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God Desiring to Have Mercy Rather than Sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Following this, the Lord said, But if you had known what this is: I will have mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless v. 7 . By this, the Lord pointed out that what the Pharisees did was not according to God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They were strict in the regulations, but neglected God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But God desires to have mercy rather than sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>e. The Son of Man Being the Lord of the Sabbath</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Finally, in verse 8 the Lord said, For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How bold the Lord Jesus was!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He won the case, and the Pharisees, who were shocked and frightened, were silenced.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They had nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord s telling the Pharisees that He was Lord of the Sabbath was like someone today telling a highway patrolman that he is lord of the highway.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose you are stopped by a highway patrolman.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then you tell him, Don t bother me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am the lord of the highway, and the highway belongs to me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You are simply a highway patrolman hired by me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As the lord of the highway, I can change all the regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yes, I gave you some instructions concerning the highway, but now I am changing them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because I am the lord of the highway, I don t need to notify you about it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verse 8 the Lord indicated a third change, a right-asserting change from the Sabbath to the Lord of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As the Lord of the Sabbath, He had the right to change the regulations concerning the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, the Lord gave the condemning Pharisees a threefold verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, He could do whatever He liked on the Sabbath, and whatever He did was justified by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was above all rituals and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because He was there, no attention should be paid to any rituals and regulations.</S>
