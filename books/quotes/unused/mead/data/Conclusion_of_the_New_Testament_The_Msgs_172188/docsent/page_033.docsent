   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Be Glorified</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:29 and 30 say, "Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers; and whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God has predestinated and justified us, and now He is conforming us to the image of His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, we shall have full glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since glorification will take place in the future, we may wonder why Paul in Romans 8:30 uses the past tense and says "glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although in our experience we have not been glorified, the Bible says that we have been glorified already.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything mentioned in 8:30 is an accomplished fact predestinated, called, justified, and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason Paul speaks this way here is that, although we are subject to time, God is not.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the God of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With Him, as the eternal God, there is no time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, in the sight of God, we have already been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With God everything is timeless.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His sight our predestination, calling, justification, and glorification are eternal matters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, our glorification is secured and ensured in the eternal God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, according to our experience, glorification will take place in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 8:30 does not say that we shall be put into glory; rather, this verse indicates that we shall be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Glory is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ, the hope of glory Col 1:27 , has been sown into us as the seed of glory, and this seed will grow until it reaches the stage of blossoming, at which time the glory will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For God to glorify us means that the glory which has been sown into us saturates our whole being and is expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When our entire being has been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, that glory will come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what it means for the believers to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we experience this glorification, we shall be in the expression of the processed Triune God. a. With the Incomparable Glory</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The believers will be glorified with the incomparable glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Romans 8:18 Paul says, "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here we see that the coming glory is incomparable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The present suffering means nothing compared with the coming glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we have not yet been glorified, we cannot imagine what this incomparable glory is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, according to the revelation in the New Testament, we may be assured that this glory will come not objectively from without but subjectively and organically from within us. b.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Realizing the Hope of Glory Which Is Christ in Us</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Colossians 1:27b speaks of, "Christ in you, the hope of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here Paul says not only that Christ dwells within us, but also that He dwells within us as our hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Greek "glory" in this verse is "the glory."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is the mystery v. 26 which is full of glory now.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This glory will be manifested to its fullest extent when Christ returns to glorify His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, it is a hope, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ Himself is this hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ can be our hope of glory because He dwells in our spirit to be our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to Colossians 3:4, when Christ our life is manifested, we shall be manifested with Him in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will appear to be glorified in our redeemed and transfigured body Rom 8:23; Phil 3:21; 2 Thes 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Christ comes, we shall be glorified in Him, and He will be glorified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that the indwelling Christ will saturate our entire being, including our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This will cause our body to be transfigured and to become like His glorious body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At that time Christ will be glorified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is Christ in us as the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Colossians 1:27 indicates that the glory with which we shall be glorified dwells in us right now.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This glory is not a thing this glory is a living person, the indwelling Christ, the all-inclusive embodiment of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This very Christ is now the seed of glory within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the blossom of a carnation flower is in the carnation seed, so our glorification is in Christ as the seed of glory dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, the growth of this seed will issue in the "blossom" of the believers' glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every believer in Christ, without exception, is like a carnation seed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through regeneration, the life of glory has come into us, and now we have a seed of glory within us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The life that we have within us as a seed is the life of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is Christ in us, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Christ who is God's expression, the effulgence of God's glory Heb 1:3 , is the One who has come into us to be our hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the past we may have realized that Christ is the eternal life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now, with Colossians 1:27 as the basis, we need to see that the Christ who is in us is also the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our hope of glory is the indwelling Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This glory is still a hope to us because, as yet, it has not come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since the seed of glory has been sown into us, we all hope to see it blossoming.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One day, at the right time, Christ will come to be glorified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that He will come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the one hand, Christ is coming from without; on the other hand, He is coming from within us, for He has been sown into us as the seed of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This seed will grow until it reaches the stage of blossoming, and then the glory within us will come out and be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we experience this glorification, we shall be fully in the expression of the Triune God.</S>
