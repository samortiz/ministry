   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all realize that everything is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But not long after the New Testament was completed, the church began to lose all the important things found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, by the fifteenth century, everything was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Very little of God was known.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the Lord began His recovery at the time of the Reformation with Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, He recovered justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then after this, He recovered many more things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the things regarding the church were not recovered until the eighteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first time after the Reformation that Christians began to practice the church life was when the Moravian Brethren came together under the leadership of Count Zinzendorf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They practiced the church life, but they did not have adequate knowledge regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were, however, inspired to come together to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They came from Moravia and settled in Bohemia, a part of today s Austria.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The doctrine of the church was largely inadequate until 1829.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we read the history of the church, especially the history of the Lord s recovery, we will see that it was from 1829 that the British Brethren, under the leadership of John Nelson Darby, became clear concerning the doctrine of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the early part of their church life, there was tremendous reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But gradually, they lost the reality and have declined very much to mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The doctrine is good, but only to have the doctrine without the reality is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then in the first part of this century, the Lord began to recover something more regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What He recovered was the reality, or we may call it the spirituality, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spiritual principles of the Body of Christ were recovered mainly in the first third of this century.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE PRACTICALITY OF THE LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nearly all the books written in the last century by the Brethren were concerning the doctrine of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There was a shortage of the reality and even of the spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But in the first part of this century many books were written regarding the reality, the spirituality, and all the spiritual principles of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was wonderful, it was real, but it was not practical.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There was the doctrine and the reality and in a sense the spirituality, but no practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who saw the spirituality of the church simply did not know how to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was after 1930 that the Lord used Brother Watchman Nee to recover the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He not only saw the doctrine and the reality, but also the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At least three or four books were written by Watchman Nee concerning the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first was published in 1934, and he asked me to write an introduction to that book, which I did.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This book was written before The Normal Christian Church Life and was called The Assembly Life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The messages in this book were given in January of 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the start of the publication of Brother Nee s vision regarding the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then later, in 1937, Brother Nee gave us another series of messages, which was clear and adequate regarding the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These messages were put into a book in Chinese in 1938 and translated into English in 1939.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The English translation was originally entitled Concerning Our Missions but is now called The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the second book by Brother Nee regarding the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then after the war, from 1948 until his imprisonment in 1952, Brother Nee gave many messages on the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have chosen some of these messages and put them together in the book Further Talks on the Church Life by Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This could be considered the third book by Brother Nee regarding the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the history of the Lord s recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He first recovered the practice of the church life in the eighteenth century with the Moravian Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But that was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then in the nineteenth century He recovered the doctrine of the church, and at the beginning of this century the reality and spirituality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then after 1930 He began to recover the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we have inherited all the items of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have inherited the doctrine, the spirituality, and the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are not boasting in a proud way, but we can humbly say by His mercy that we have the doctrine, the spirituality, and the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Where is the practicality?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The practicality of the church life is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not have the local churches, we do not have the practicality of the church life.</S>
