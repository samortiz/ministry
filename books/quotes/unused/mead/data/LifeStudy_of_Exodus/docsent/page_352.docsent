   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIVE THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 27:1-8; 38:1-7; 40:6, 29; Heb 13:10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message I pointed out that it is not easy to understand the record in Exodus concerning the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Certain aspects of this record are very puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Exodus 27:5 speaks of the ledge of the altar beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is difficult to decide how to translate the Hebrew word for ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The King James Version says compass, another version says border, and still other versions speak of a margin or rim.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A ledge serves to hold something and is a protection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some students of the Bible think that the ledge was outside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to their understanding, the ministering priests stood on the ledge which went around the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who hold to this view appeal to Leviticus 9:22, a verse which says that Aaron came down from offering of the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They also refer to 2 Chronicles 30:16, saying that the priests stood in their place, that is, on the ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, with these two verses as their basis, they understand the border or ledge to be outside the altar and to be a place where the ministering priests could stand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>X. A BRONZE GRATING OF NETWORK</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What was the ledge, and where was it located?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These questions are not easily answered.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am quite sure, however, that the ledge was inside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 4 says, And you shall make for it a grating, a network of bronze; and you shall make upon the net four rings of bronze upon its four ends.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to verse 5, the network was to reach unto the half of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The altar was three cubits high, five cubits long, and five cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The grating, the network of bronze, inside the altar stretched horizontally from side to side at the middle of the height of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The wood was placed upon this grating, and the sacrifices were put upon the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the wood and the sacrifices burned, the ashes fell through the grating to the bottom of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, verse 5 tells us clearly that the grating was put under the ledge of the altar beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The composition of this verse is rather unusual, but the Hebrew does say under the ledge of the altar beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fact that the grating was under the ledge indicates that the ledge could not have been outside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The grating was not only under the ledge; it was beneath the ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the ledge had been outside, how could the grating inside the altar have been beneath the ledge?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, I believe definitely that the ledge was inside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The altar was made with acacia wood overlaid with bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fire on the altar was to burn without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Does it not seem that the heat of the fire would pass through the bronze covering and cause the acacia wood inside to become charred?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be sure, this would have been the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason, I believe that the ledge protected the four walls of the altar from the heat of the fire on the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible does not tell us of what material the ledge was made.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I believe, however, that it must have been made of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, I believe that above the grating and around the four walls there was a ledge of bronze protecting the walls from the heat of the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This may be the reason verse 5 says that the grating was not only under the ledge, but also beneath the ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One writer has suggested that the network was actually at the bottom of the altar and reached halfway up the sides of the walls.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, this writer supposes that when the altar was set up, it was placed on two heaps of dirt to allow air to reach the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, such an interpretation involves too much guesswork.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if you would ask me how the air could get in, I would have to answer that I do not know, for the Scripture does not give us this detail.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The very fact that the altar has certain puzzling elements has a spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The altar should actually be very easy to describe, easier to describe than the other items of furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But as we have pointed out, the record concerning the altar is rather puzzling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although it is simple, it is nevertheless hard to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The significance of this is that it is not possible for us to understand thoroughly the mystery of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yes, in the New Testament the cross is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are told clearly that Christ was crucified, and in 1 Corinthians 1 Paul uses the expression the word of the cross, telling us that the word of the cross is the power of God v. 18 . But we are unable to apprehend the mystery of Christ s redemption thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I first came into the ministry fifty years ago, I tried many times to give messages on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, each time I rose up to speak, I did not have much utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The reason was that it is very difficult to speak about the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Are you able to speak about the cross of Christ in an adequate way?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course, you can declare that the cross was the place where Christ was put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You can also say that on the cross Christ bore our sins, that we were crucified with Him, and that even the Devil was destroyed on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But how about the mystery of Christ s death?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even those who have been teaching the Scriptures for years will find it difficult to speak concerning the mystery of Christ s all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christians may place a cross on top of their places of worship, and some may even wear a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, they cannot speak about the cross adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can read the verses in the New Testament which refer either to the cross or to Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nevertheless, after reading these verses, we still are not able to apprehend the mystery of Christ s death thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The death of Christ is a great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because it is such a mystery, we do not have a way to describe it adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Another puzzling matter is related to the grating, or the network, within the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The grating has four rings at its four ends.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, these rings are also for the poles used in carrying the altar 38:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The grating is on the inside, but the rings are on the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How, then, could the rings be attached to the grating?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are told clearly that the rings are upon the four ends of the network, and the rings must be outside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Otherwise, the poles could not be put into the rings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is puzzling how the rings could be attached to the network and yet be outside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If there were only the four walls of the altar without the grating inside the altar, the altar would be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The significance of the altar depends completely on the grating, the network, with the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Yes, the rings are for the move of the altar, but they are connected to the grating inside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Without the grating, there would be no rings, and without the rings, the altar could not move.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This brings us to a very important matter: Without the grating there would be no way to have the fire used in burning the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, both for the burning of the sacrifices and for the move of the altar, the grating with the four rings is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We may compare the grating and the rings to the inward parts of our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our inward parts are more vital than our skin and hair.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the same principle, the grating is the important part of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the grating were removed, the altar would become an empty box, not useful for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The content of the altar is the grating with the rings.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is important to find out the significance of the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The grating was made of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In typology, bronze signifies the righteous judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This should also be the significance of the grating being made of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that the altar should be related to a person, for it was made of acacia wood overlaid with bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This signifies that Christ became a man to die on the cross to bear the judgment of God for us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The cross is not merely a thing; it is related to a person, as indicated by the fact that the altar, a type of the cross, was made of acacia wood, which signifies the humanity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Therefore, the cross is related to a person, and this person is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The bronze grating within the altar signifies that God s judgment reached the inward parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God s judgment upon Christ as our Substitute was not merely outward.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The holy fire of God s judgment was not just outside of Christ, but also burned within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is indicated in Psalm 22, a psalm concerning the sufferings of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Verse 14 says, I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This indicates that when Christ bore God s judgment, that judgment reached His heart, His inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>His bones were out of joint, but His heart melted in His inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This means that God s judgment upon Christ was experienced more inwardly than it was outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Not many Christian preachers have given messages concerning the inward aspect of Christ s sufferings on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Most of those who preach about the sufferings of Christ speak about the outward aspect of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>To repeat, Christ bore God s judgment not only outwardly, but also inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In fact, He suffered more inwardly than He did outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The grating was not outside of Him; it was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Therefore, the place where the holy fire of God s judgment burned was in the inward parts of the Lord Jesus.</S>
