<p>Ephesians 1:4 says that we are holy and without blemish before Him in love. To be without blemish does not mean that we are perfect. Even if we seem to be perfect and holy, we still have blemishes if we are not overlaid with God. If someone were to bring to the tabernacle a board that was perfect, clean, and good but not overlaid with gold, it would be considered blemished. Only after it is overlaid with gold can it be without blemish.</p>
<p>To be without blemish also means that we are fully corresponding to what God desires, that we satisfy God&rsquo;s desire in a full way. A sister may love her guests very much and cook many good things for them, but if what she prepares does not match their desire, it is blemished. In the same way, to be holy and without blemish before God means that we fully satisfy God&rsquo;s desire. The church with the sonship, being holy and without blemish, fully satisfies God&rsquo;s desire. One day we will see the reality of this. The New Jerusalem will be the real sonship, the real holiness, and that which is truly without blemish before God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Display the Manifold Wisdom of God</h2>
<p>The foregoing items of God&rsquo;s intention concerning the church are on the positive side. On the negative side, the church deals with the enemy of God. In Ephesians 1 there is the positive side, the positive aspect of the church, while in chapter 3 there is the negative side related to the enemy. Through the church God&rsquo;s manifold wisdom is made known to the rulers and authorities, and the enemy is subdued (v. 10). If there were not such an evil one in the universe, God&rsquo;s wisdom would not need to be manifested. It is through all the troubles rendered by Satan that God has the opportunity to show forth His wisdom. This whole universe has been damaged, but God is willing for it to be damaged, because He has His purpose. God needs such an evil one as Satan to damage the universe so that God&rsquo;s wisdom may be fully manifested. Every damage from Satan is a good opportunity to display God&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
<p>We should never be afraid of troubles or damage in the church. Whenever there is a troubling to the church, we must go to God and say, &ldquo;God, we praise and thank You. Here is a good chance for You to show forth something.&rdquo; Eventually we will see that a glorious church will come out. Many &ldquo;stories&rdquo; have been inserted into the history of the church. Some are happy, but others seem sorrowful. If we consider the condition of the church, we may be bothered. Problems come from the brothers, and they come from the sisters. If we have the vision, however, we will always be happy. Praise the Lord, the more troubles there are, the more opportunities there are to display the Lord&rsquo;s wisdom.</p>
<p>We need to thank the Lord that He gives us many troublesome brothers and sisters. God&rsquo;s wisdom is made manifest through, by, in, and with all the problems. The Lord Jesus told the Jews, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (John 2:19). Their destroying simply gave the Lord the opportunity to build up something greater than what was destroyed. Therefore, in God&rsquo;s view the situation is glorious. In our dictionary <em>troublesome</em> is a good word, not a bad word. We have to change our way of thinking. <em>Troublesome</em> actually means wonderful. All the &ldquo;troublesome&rdquo; brothers and sisters are wonderful. Without them God&rsquo;s wisdom could not be manifest. I have been a Christian and have worked for the Lord for many years. Many times I was disappointed by certain brothers. However, one day in the New Jerusalem we will see those brothers, and we will marvel at what kind of wonderful persons they have become.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CAPITAL, POWER, AND WISDOM<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>All the above items are related to God&rsquo;s purpose, aim, goal, and intention. Moreover, in order to have a business, an economy, we need three things. First, we need the capital, the finances, the funds. Without the capital, we can do nothing. Then we also need the power, the strength, to run our corporation. Third, we need the wisdom, the best way, to do things. We may have the biggest corporation with the most capital, but if we do not have the power, we can do nothing. Likewise, if we have the capital and the power but not the wisdom to run the corporation in the right way, the corporation will become bankrupt. A successful corporation needs the capital, the power, and the way, the wisdom. In the two books of Ephesians and Colossians we can see these three matters for God&rsquo;s economy, His administration and &ldquo;corporation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The capital in God&rsquo;s economy is God Himself. Ephesians 3:19 says that the church is filled unto all the fullness of God. God Himself is the finance. He Himself is the greatest capital with which He runs His business. The fullness of God in the church is the fullness of the Godhead that dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9). Therefore, the fullness of God, that is God Himself with all that He is, is the very capital, the finance, of His economy.</p>
<p>In these two books we also have the power. Ephesians 1:19 and 20 speak of the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies. This is the divine power. Moreover, the apostle Paul tells us that the power for him to minister was an inward energizing power (Col. 1:29). There was something within Paul that energized him all the time, and he served and ministered by this power.</p>
<p>Moreover, the wisdom for God&rsquo;s economy is Christ as the wisdom of God. First Corinthians 1:24 tells us that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. Therefore, God Himself, God&rsquo;s divine power, and God&rsquo;s divine, manifold wisdom are the three items for God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy, His corporation, is carried out by God Himself as the capital, God&rsquo;s divine power, and God&rsquo;s divine wisdom as the way. Praise the Lord, the church is the very center of this economy! God carries out this economy&mdash;that is, He produces the church&mdash;with Himself as the capital, by His own divine power, and according to His own divine way, His divine wisdom.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
