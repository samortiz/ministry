<h2 class="head2">The Application of the Divine Truths<br />Avoiding Uplifting Any Basic Truths and Neglecting Any Subordinate Truths<br />or Stressing Any of Them</h2><p>The application of the divine truths must avoid uplifting any basic truths, such as the three sections of sanctification, the designation of Christ as the seed of David to be the firstborn Son of God, the acknowledgment of the fact that &ldquo;I am of Christ,&rdquo; etc., to cause divisions that divide Christ, including His Body (1 Cor. 1:11-13a). Some said that they belonged to Paul, some to Cephas, some to Apollos, and some, the &ldquo;superior&rdquo; ones, to Christ. However, Christ is not divided. You must be careful. You may teach the right truths, but to stress any one too much may be the cause of a division.</p><p>The application of the divine truths must also avoid neglecting any subordinate truths or stressing any of them, which leads toward the direction of division that divides the Body of Christ. Both to stress and to neglect certain truths may cause division. When we met in Elden Hall, quite often Pentecostal people would come to us with speaking in tongues. The brothers would inquire of me about them, but I would indicate that there was no problem. We allowed them to speak in tongues because it is in the Bible. I have studied much concerning speaking in tongues. I learned that even before the New Testament age, people already spoke in tongues by the power of demons. A brother from Ghana told us that when he returned to his homeland, he saw the unbelievers there speaking in tongues by the demons. Some speaking in tongues is by the demons, while some, although very little, is by the Holy Spirit. The Pentecostals, however, do not discern this. Not only is some speaking in tongues by demons; some is merely by the human power to speak syllables. This is neither by the Holy Spirit nor by the evil spirit, but simply by men themselves. Certain ones put their hands on your head and teach you to turn your tongue and say &ldquo;Praise Jesus&rdquo; very quickly. As a result, some syllables come out, which they claim is speaking in tongues. I analyzed this very much. Then I found out that this was only nonsense syllables, not a genuine tongue.</p><p>T. Austin-Sparks was a spiritual giant. He was very high. He was a top writer concerning eternal life, and we may even say that the line of eternal life in Christian writings stopped after his death. Once I invited him to Taipei. He was very strong against tongue-speaking; he opposed it too much. The Pentecostal people, however, stress it too much. They make the tongue to be the whole body. They say that when they speak in tongues, they are happy. To be sure, speaking in nonsense syllables will make you happy and very relaxed. In my study of this, however, I found a good point: Their intention is to contact the Lord, and sometimes spontaneously they did contact the Lord. We cannot deny this. From this I learned that not all wrong teachings are heresies. Some wrong teachings are simply wrong teachings. Therefore, we have to be careful.</p>
