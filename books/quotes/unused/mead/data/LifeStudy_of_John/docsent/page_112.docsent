   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although sometimes, for our speaking and understanding, we use the word person, we should not press this term too far into tritheism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot explain the Triune God adequately, but it is a fact that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you have seen the Son, you have seen the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son to be seen among the believers.</S>
