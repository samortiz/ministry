   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FORTY THE EXPERIENCES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PORTRAYED BY THE ARRANGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE FURNITURE OF THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we need to see the experiences of Christ as portrayed by the arrangement of the furniture of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians think that we can only experience Christ as our Savior and Protector.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to those who have had Pentecostal experiences, Christ is a Healer and a Worker of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To them, experiencing Christ is a matter of witnessing miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But Christ is altogether mysterious, and our experiences of Him are also mysterious and very difficult to define.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank God that this is clearly portrayed in His Holy Word by the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This arrangement is of three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In each section there was furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Bible teachers agree that the entire tabernacle with its contents is a detailed picture of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I studied the typology of the tabernacle as a youth, I was told that it was a picture of Christ, but I was never taught that it was also a portrait of our experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Gradually in my experience throughout the years, I came to realize that the arrangement of the furniture of the tabernacle presents a full definition of our experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this message we are not concerned with learning typology which was emphasized by the Brethren teachers more than a century ago.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The recovery today is not a recovery of the teachings of typology but a recovery of the experiences of Christ as portrayed in the types.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to enter into the experiences of Christ as shown in the arrangement of the furniture in God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I. IN THE OUTER COURT IN AN OUTWARD WAY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the outer court are the brass altar and the brass laver.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both of these signify the experiences of Christ in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A. At the Brass Altar</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the brass altar, which signifies the cross Exo 40:29 , we participate in Christ mainly as our sin offering and also as all the other offerings Heb 13:10, 12; 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In principle, the offerings solve our problems with God, fully reconciling us to Him and making our situation with God righteous and peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through the cross of Christ, we are right with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ as our sin offering has solved the problem of sin, and as our peace offering He has also made peace between us and God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, through the offerings offered by Christ on the cross, our condition is one of righteousness and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the first experience that we enjoy in Christ outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. At the Brass Laver</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the altar is the laver, which signifies the washing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both the altar and the laver were made of brass.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In typology, brass signifies God s righteous judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The washing of the Spirit is based upon the judgment Christ has borne for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the brass laver Exo 40:30-32 we partake of the washing of the Spirit, which is based upon the redemption of Christ Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although we have experienced Christ as the offerings, before we can come into God s presence we also need to be washed, cleansed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This also is somewhat outward.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>IN THE HOLY PLACE IN AN INNER WAY</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After having the two kinds of experiences in the outer court, we are qualified to come into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Firstly, we enter into the Holy Place, where our experiences of Christ turn from the outward to the inward.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here, in the Holy Place, we experience Christ in an inner way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A. At the Showbread Table</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we enter into the Holy Place, the first item of furniture is the showbread table Exo 40:22-23 , which signifies Christ as our life supply John 6:35, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the showbread table twelve loaves of bread were displayed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The number twelve signifies eternal completion and perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is our eternal bread.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our inward enjoyment of Him at the showbread table is eternal.</S>
