   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MIND UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In our speaking, we must also pay attention to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whether a word should be spoken first or last is a decision that rests with the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our service as a minister of the word, our mind occupies a very important place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If our mental faculty is versatile, we can place a word at the beginning of our speaking or at the end. Either place will fit, and the spirit will be released during the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if our mind is not so versatile, nothing works.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In such a case, whether the word comes to our mind at the beginning of the speaking or at the end, the spirit is not released in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every minister of the word has to guard his mind carefully from any damage.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He has to treasure his mind like a pianist treasures his two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people are too careless with their mind; they can never be proper ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to allow the Lord to freely direct our mind; we cannot allow our mind to go wild.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not allow our mind to dwell on illogical things, vain things, or unimportant things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must protect our mind like a pianist protecting his two hands.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not set our mind on low or base things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Spirit cannot use our mind when He calls for it, we are frustrated from serving as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not mean that the mind is the source of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a minister of the word bases his activity on his mind, such activity should be condemned and destroyed to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The thought that a thorough study of the Scriptures will qualify a man to teach is an abominable proposition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Any thought that is independent of the spirit should be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Any message that is based on the mind as the source should be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this does not mean that we should annul the function of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every book of the New Testament is written with rich expression of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul s Epistles, such as his Epistle to the Romans, are full of thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet the thoughts are high and lofty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The book of Romans does not originate from the mind; it originates from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet the thoughts contained in that book flow out with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The source must be the spirit, not the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must take good care of our mind so that it can be available to God when He needs to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not indiscriminately condemn our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should condemn the mind as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is wrong for a man to preach according to his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The proper way to preach is with the spirit by the help of the mind; no one should condemn this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more spiritual a message is, the richer the thought behind it should be.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All spiritual messages are full of thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the spirit is released, there is the need for rich and adequate thoughts to support it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should give our thoughts the proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our speaking, our mind has to decide the order and the way that the words are to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a word comes to our mind first, we should speak it first; if it comes to our mind last, we should speak it last.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should speak according to where our mind leads us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must realize that our spirit does not control our speaking directly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Direct control by the spirit would mean that we are speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, the spirit directs our speaking from behind our thoughts and understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the meaning of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our understanding must be available for the spirit s use.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If it is not available, our spirit is blocked, and there is no medium between the spirit and the word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The proper medium between the spirit and the word is the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the reason that we have to carefully guard our mind before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The mind must be renewed daily.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must not allow our mind to habitually remain in a low place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some peoples minds are habitually low, and the Spirit cannot use them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to preserve our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is as we touch the ministry of the word that we know the depth of the meaning of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many people do not understand the meaning of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Consecration means that our whole being is made available to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to make everything available to God, every part of our mind must be made available to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every day we have to exercise care before the Lord; every day we have to guard our mind from becoming low.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If it remains low all the time, we will not be able to pull it up when we have need of it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to train our mind every day so that it will be available for the Scripture s use.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the only way to insure that our mind does not become a hindrance to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God must be able to direct our mind at will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By His mercy, He will direct our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He will let our mind recall what we should say.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The things that should be spoken first will come to our mind first, and the things that should be spoken last will come to our mind last.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our words will be controlled by our mind, and our mind will be controlled by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If our spirit can direct our mind, everything will be right.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It will be right if a word is spoken first, and it will be right if it is spoken last.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It will be right if we speak more, and it will be equally right if we speak less.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the mind is proper and functional, the word will come out in any case.</S>
