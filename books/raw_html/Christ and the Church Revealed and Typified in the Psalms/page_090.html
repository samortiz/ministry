<p>When we put all these verses together, we see how wonderful this city is. Comparing the aspects of the city with the aspects of the house, we see the difference. The main aspects of the house speak of God’s presence, whereas the principal aspects of the city bespeak God’s authority, God’s ruling power, God’s reigning. Hence, the house is for the expression of God, and the city is for the dominion of God. The house and the city of God fulfill the purpose of God in the creation of man as expressed in Genesis 1:26, “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion…” The image is for the expression, and the dominion is for the authority. Eventually, through Christ and with Christ we have the house for God’s presence, as God’s expression, and we have the city for God’s authority, as God’s dominion. God’s eternal purpose is fulfilled by the house and the city. In the house God is a Father, and in the city God is a King. Both the house and the city are the church, or we may say, the local churches. A local church, in one sense, must be the house of God, and in another sense it must also be the city of God.<p>A city evidently is much stronger and larger than a house. Therefore we say that when the house is enlarged it becomes the city, just as the New Jerusalem. We are told that in the New Jerusalem there will be no temple (Rev. 21:22), no house, but just the city. It is because the entire city of the New Jerusalem is the enlargement of the temple. The temple enlarged becomes the city. It is larger, stronger, and safer than the house.<p>We can apply the principle of the house and the city to the local churches in this way: If the presence of God is among us, if when people come to our meeting they worship and say, “God indeed is among you,” this is the house. If, on the other hand, when people come among us and realize that there is not only the presence of God, but some kind of divine rule and authority, this is not only the house, but the house with the city.<p>Sometimes in a local church we sense the presence of God, but not much of God’s authority. We sense that God is among them, but that on the other hand there is a shortage of divine order. That means that in that local church there is the reality of the house, but not much of the city. In other churches we sense not only the presence of God, but also something of divine government and heavenly authority. That is the city. If a local church is in this kind of situation, that church is considerably stronger and safer. It is more elevated, more established, and more enlarged. It is not only the house, but the house with the city.<p>By looking into all these aspects of Christ, the house, and the city as presented in the Psalms, we see how wonderful Christ is, how marvelous the house is, and how glorious and terrifying the city is!<p>Either for Christ to gain the earth, or for the earth to turn and worship Christ, both are through the city. Christ gains the earth and rules over the earth through the city, because He will be in the city. Then the earth will turn to Christ, remember Christ, worship Christ, and praise Christ—all through the city. The city is for the earth.
