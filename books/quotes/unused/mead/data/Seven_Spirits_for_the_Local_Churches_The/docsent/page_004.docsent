   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SEVEN EYES OF THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is so strange that the intensified Spirit is not only the seven lamps but also the seven eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord was on earth, He had only two eyes, and I believe His eyes were always so mild and gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They would never cause one to be afraid of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But now He has seven eyes, just as the burning lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What kind of Jesus is this?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need such a Jesus today with seven eyes as the seven burning lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then when He sees us, He will set us on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If His eyes look at us, we will be burnt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is all we need today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet we must keep in mind that this burning, sevenfold Spirit is not for any individual or for the so-called universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is definitely for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we would be burnt and burning, we must be in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The book of Revelation is not written to any individual saint or to the universal church in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a book written to the local churches on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are going to listen, understand, and receive blessing from this book, we must be in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To receive anything, we must be in the proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord will not change His position; we must change ours.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The right position is to be in the local churches, for the Lord sent this book to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are not in the local churches, we lose our position, and if we miss the position, how can we understand?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must be in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not a small thing, for Revelation tells us clearly that the sevenfold Spirit is for the seven local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE SPEAKING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is something more that we must see about the intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the beginning of each of the seven epistles in Revelation, the Lord told John to write what He said 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But at the end of each epistle, the Lord said that we must hear what the Spirit says to the churches 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the beginning it is the Lord who speaks, but at the end it is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can read today what the Lord has put into writing, but simply reading the word of the Lord is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must also hear what the Spirit says.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only to have the written word is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all need to hear the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Old Testament always says, Thus says Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in Revelation it is, The Spirit says.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all must realize that the age has been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today is the age of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What the Lord says in the Word is not enough; we must listen to what the Spirit says.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have both the Bible and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible is a book which is already written, but what the Spirit says is something which is spoken instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today s dead Christianity only takes care of the written Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They argue that they are fundamental and scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But they are fundamentally dead and scripturally cold.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They only have the beginning of the seven epistles; they do not have the ending.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not have the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the end of each epistle, the Lord Jesus tells us that we must hear what the Spirit says to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today we must listen to what the sevenfold Spirit speaks to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must not only read the written book but also listen to the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I was young, I was taught that a Christian must keep the word of the Bible and do everything according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I was never taught that I must listen to the speaking of the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even today many so-called Christian churches and teachers emphasize that we must understand the Bible, walk according to the Bible, and do everything according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the Lord Jesus tells us that this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not mean that we should drop the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But beside the Bible, we need the speaking of the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To only have the written Bible is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We also need the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need the Spirit to speak to us through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need the Spirit to make the Bible a living book to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Praise the Lord, we have the written word in our hands, and we have the living Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must have both.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need the Bible, and we need the Spirit and even more, the intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is necessary that we read the written word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But it is more necessary to listen to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not to the saints, or to the church, but to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is not to the church in the heavens but to the local churches on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why in this book of the Bible it does not say that the Lord says, or the apostle John says, but the Spirit says.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the Old Testament it is Jehovah says.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the Gospels it is Jesus says.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the Epistles it is always the apostles say.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But in this book it is the Spirit says.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is because the age has been changed to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Eventually, in the book of Revelation, the Spirit and the church are one.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At the beginning the Spirit was speaking to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But at the end the Spirit and the bride composed of all the churches speak together.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Spirit and the church have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the fulfillment of Matthew 28.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The church has been baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now the Spirit and the church are one.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must learn to have our daily Christian walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I have mentioned already that I was taught when I was young that we must walk according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But eventually, I found in the Bible that we must walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Galatians 5:16 and 25 say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Some today would argue concerning whether we are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But we would rather be livingly wrong than dead right.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Whether we are wrong or not is questionable, but one thing is sure: those who argue about right and wrong are really dead.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As long as you are dead, what is the value of being right?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Sometimes I have said that the most right persons are those who are buried in the cemeteries.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They can never do anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>From the first day of the year to the last, they are always so dead right.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must take care of whether we are living or dead more than whether we are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We must walk livingly according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is not a matter of whether we are right, but of whether we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is not a matter of how to do this or how to do that; it is a matter of listening to and following the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The age is changed to the Spirit, so we all need a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>So many people speak much about the church, but they have never been turned.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>To see the local churches with the intensified Spirit, we need a turn.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>John said that after he turned, he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I do believe that John at that time was quite disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He knew the churches were deteriorating, and he was in exile from all the saints on the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In his disappointment he heard a voice, and when he turned to see the voice, he saw seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He turned and he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Oh, how we need to turn today!</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We need to turn from doctrines to the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We need to turn from teachings to the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We need to turn from religion to the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We need to turn from Christian traditions to the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We need to turn from what we know to the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It is only when we turn from our mind to the Spirit that we will see that the sevenfold intensified Spirit is for the local churches.</S>
