   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESULT OF COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Finally, we need to see the various aspects of the result of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Corporate Expression of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, coordination results in the corporate expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Becoming Burning and Full of Light</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, coordination results in those who coordinate together becoming burning and full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because they are burning and shining, they can enlighten others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Move of the Great Wheel</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Another result of coordination is God s move, signified by the great wheel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the living creatures coordinate together, the great wheel appears.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that God s move follows the coordination of the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there is no coordination, there cannot be the move of the great wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s Administration</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The coordination of the four living creatures also results in God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The throne of the divine administration rests upon the coordination of the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without such a coordination, God would not have a means of ruling and He would not have the means to express His authority and His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Carrying Out of God s Will</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A further result of coordination is the carrying out of God s will and His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of the coordination of the four living creatures, there is a way for God s will and God s plan to be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to be impressed with the crucial importance of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before we can be coordinated together, we need to experience the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum and thereby become the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we need to have the image of a man and the faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, we must have the eagle s wings, the man s hands, and the calf s hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have all these things, then we will be able to coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This coordination will result in the corporate expression of Christ, in our becoming burning, shining, and full of light, in God s move, in God s ruling, and in the accomplishment of God s eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to see that coordination is the key to understanding the vision in Ezekiel 1.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, many things are for coordination; on the other hand, many things are based on coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Coordination is the key.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May we all see this and may the Lord bring us all into a coordination with many other living creatures for the sake of the corporate expression of Christ, God s move, and God s administration.</S>
