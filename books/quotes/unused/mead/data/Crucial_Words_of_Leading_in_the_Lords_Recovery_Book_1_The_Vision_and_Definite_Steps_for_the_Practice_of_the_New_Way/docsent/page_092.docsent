   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SCHEDULING IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we read the New Testament carefully, especially the Gospels and Acts, we find that both the Lord and the disciples worked with plans and arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord had a schedule and a plan; He did not pass His days on earth foolishly and carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Luke 13 the Pharisees threatened the Lord, saying, Get out and go from here, for Herod wants to kill you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord answered, saying, Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and accomplish healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I am perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, I must journey today and tomorrow and on the following day because it is not acceptable for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows that the Lord had a schedule and an itinerary.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, the Lord s itinerary was set from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His birth in Bethlehem, His flight to Egypt, His growth in Nazareth, and His being called a Nazarene were all prophesied long ago in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The same is true with His death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Daniel 9:26 prophesies concerning the year the Messiah was to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was to be in the sixty-ninth week.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, He had to be killed on the fourteenth day of the first month during the Passover at Mount Moriah, which is Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the time came, the Lord delivered Himself to death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He acted according to God s plan, which was set before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First the Lord toiled and fulfilled His ministry in Galilee for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then when the last year approached and the Passover was drawing near, He knew within Himself that He had to arrive in Jerusalem six days before the Passover to be examined by men as a lamb, so He set out from Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the disciples saw this, they marveled, and His followers were afraid Mark 10:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His itinerary was very definite; He needed to pass through Samaria on His way to Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He needed to arrive at His destination Jerusalem at the appointed time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He could not miss a day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If He arrived a day earlier or later, He would not have been crucified on the day of the Passover, and the prophecy of the Old Testament would not have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord planned ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As He approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the other side of the Mount of Olives, He sent two disciples and said, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her; untie them and lead them to Me Matt 21:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the Lord s planning ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one brought a donkey to Him when He arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No angel appeared to the owner of the donkey in a dream the night before.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord planned this ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In addition to this, on the night of the Passover, when they were about to take the feast, and the disciples asked the Lord where they should prepare the meal, He answered, Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am keeping the passover at your house with My disciples 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This again is an example of the Lord s planning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who are too spiritual may say that since the Lord Jesus is the Lord of everything, He could call a donkey into being and ride it into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If He wanted a place for the Passover meal, He could also call it into being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There was no need to make preparations ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is true that He is God, but He entered into humanity and became the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As far as His divinity is concerned, He did not need to ride on a donkey or a colt.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not need to pass through Samaria on His way from Galilee to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But because He was a man, He needed to move step by step in the fashion of a man Phil 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since a man needs a certain number of days to travel from Galilee to Jerusalem, He made arrangements ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Old Testament prophesied concerning His move, and He acted and made preparations accordingly to match the prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since the Lord was a man, there was the need for Him to make many detailed arrangements involving persons and matters; hence, there was the need of schedules and budgets.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible shows that the Lord never acted hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He always worked according to His timetable.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even His visit to Lazarus and His raising him up was not done in a hurry; He followed His own timetable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Others sent men to plead with Him again and again, but He was not moved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At a certain point the disciples became indignant, but when the Lord s time came, He went.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The disciples said, The Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and You are going there again?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He did not listen to them, because He had His itinerary.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The disciples might have been unhappy; however, they had no choice but to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They said in resignation, Let us also go, that we may die with Him John 11:8, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This clearly shows that as long as we are human beings, we need schedules and budgets.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>DETAILS OF OUR SCHEDULE AND BUDGET</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today it is not only the angels or only God Himself who is involved in the gospelization of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is we, such small people, who are involved in this work, and for this reason, there is truly the need for a schedule and a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, we need to learn the local dialects, such as Taiwanese or Hakka, before we can preach the gospel to others in an intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At present, we have the following schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First, we visit the communities and the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a warm-up exercise for our eventual expedition, comparable to the training and drills of an army before it sets out for the battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We will have three years of drills.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then in the fourth year we will set out.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Within five months we will establish churches in all the towns and cities.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to this schedule, we need at least one thousand full-timers in the first phase.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Of course, we can get by with seven hundred, but the timing will be prolonged, the manpower stretched, and the impact reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There will not be as much force and success as we would like to see.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When I was young, I paid much attention to the world situation and to international developments.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In 1924 the Whampoa Military Academy was established in China.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After three years of preparation and training, the Northern Expedition for the unification of China began in 1926.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am not a student of politics or military science, but I was clear that as soon as the Northern Expedition set out, it would win, because the preparation work was more than adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the same way, I believe three years of preparation is adequate for us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We will have one thousand full-timers who will be grouped into one hundred teams.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Through visiting the communities and the campuses in a solid way, and through building up the home meetings and learning to have the proper meetings, we will accomplish the great task of gospelizing Taiwan in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The next step in our plan is to produce another five hundred full-timers in the next two years.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This will bring the number to fifteen hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We will then have a sufficient number not only to gospelize the towns but also to gospelize all the villages in another five years.</S>
