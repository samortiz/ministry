<h2 class="head1">VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS IN THE CHURCH<br />IN PREPARATION FOR THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>When the church has a gospel move, everyone has to coordinate and work together as one man. If the gospel meeting is conducted in the meeting hall, all the brothers and sisters have to do their best to invite people to come.</p><h2 class="head2">Ushering</h2><p>Ushering is very important in a gospel meeting. In particular, there is the need of proper arrangements in ushering visitors to their seats. If a preacher sees something wrong in the way his audience is sitting, the power of his speaking will be reduced by one half, even if he is a very good speaker. A gospel friend feels uncomfortable when there is too little or too much ushering. Do not pass out tracts to the friends during the meeting. This will distract their heart and spirit. The ushering brothers and sisters must be sensitive but inconspicuous. They should let their presence be felt only when they are needed.</p><h2 class="head2">Sitting beside Friends</h2><p>We need to appoint brothers and sisters to sit by every gospel friend. They can help the friends to find the right hymn and the right verses. They can sing with them or read the verses with them. If necessary, they should say a few words softly to the friends or stand up with them to pray and to receive the Lord. However, those who are sitting among the visitors should not speak too much. They should not try to set up a little separate "platform" of their own. If we do not do anything, we do not realize the technique involved. Once we do something, we realize that nothing is easy. This is like trying to keep our white shirt clean. It does not become dirty if we do not wear it. Once we wear it, however, it is hard to keep it clean. There are many things we need to pay attention to in sitting with new ones. If we are not careful, they will not receive the necessary help.</p><h2 class="head2">Getting Their Names</h2><p>We need to pay attention to helping the new ones give us their names. In helping them to leave their names, we must not only get the names but also take care of their reaction. In talking to them, our attitude and tone have to be proper and natural. We should not interrogate them like a census taker. While our friends are listening to the gospel, we should pay attention to their response. If we observe that some are touched, we should help them receive the Lord in a proper way after the message. In filling out forms for our friends after the gospel meeting, we should not only write down objective facts but also their reaction to the gospel. In this way, others can render them the proper help.</p><p>When I was in Chefoo, we had a brother who worked in the customs department. After he was revived and touched by the Lord's love, he brought many of his colleagues to salvation, but his wife was against his faith in the Lord. Once, he invited a few brothers to his house for a meal and fellowship. His wife treated the brothers coldly and only served leftovers. In spite of this, he eventually brought his wife to salvation. He did it by first inducing his wife to come to a gospel meeting. While I was speaking, he noticed that his wife was listening attentively. She was touched but dared not stand up. No one was sitting beside her. The next day she came again. She was very touched by my word. Her face turned red and tense. I was secretly keeping an eye on her. At that critical time, no one dared speak to her. Eventually, the Lord worked in her in a mighty way, and she stood up and received the Lord. If someone had been there to help her, it would have been much easier for her to receive the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Following Up</h2><p>We should not invite people to come to a gospel meeting and then let them go away easily. After the meeting, we have to follow up with discussions with them. In a gospel meeting, the message is only fifty percent of the work. Another twenty-five percent of the work lies in sitting with the friends, making various arrangements, and helping them to write down their names. The last twenty-five percent of the work consists of our follow-up discussions with our friends. We are not here to be pew members, inquirers, or nominal Christians. Every one of us has to speak the mystery of the gospel. The fire of the gospel should be as fierce as possible. The hotter the fire, the easier it is for people to get saved. This is like the fire we use for cooking. The heat should be as high as possible. Otherwise, the food will not be cooked. The conclusion of a gospel meeting is the follow-up conversation. This is a work that the whole church should participate in.</p>
