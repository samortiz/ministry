   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE EXPERIENCING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INWARDLY AND OUTWARDLY 3 Scripture Reading: Luke 24:49; Acts 1:5, 8; 2:1-4, 13-18, 33, 36, 38-39; 10:44-47; 11:15-16; 8:14-17; 19:1-2, 6; 1 Cor 12:3, 13</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s eternal purpose and ultimate intention are to mingle Himself with us for His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can experience this mingling because God is triune; that is, the Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit as the very expression and realization of the Triune God can enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we miss the Spirit, we miss the entire Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, we must experience all the steps of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, the Spirit must enter into our spirit, which is the innermost part of our being, and regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is our second birth John 3:3-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we were born of our parents, we were born the first time, but when the Spirit enters into our spirit to regenerate us, we are born a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From this point on, the Spirit dwells in our spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we love the Lord and exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, we will realize that we must reject and deny our natural man, our soul-life Matt 16:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the Spirit will strengthen and enable us to deny our self and will take more ground in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Consequently, we will be filled and saturated with Christ as the Spirit, and He will possess and occupy every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ will be our very element so that when we love, Christ loves in us; when we think, Christ thinks in our mind; and when we speak, Christ speaks through us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may think it would be good enough to be such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet if this were our condition, we would still be lacking something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We would be full of Christ inwardly, but outwardly we would still be somewhat short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, once we experience being baptized and immersed in the Spirit that is, being clothed with the Holy Spirit we will be filled with the Triune God both inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will have Christ as our life, our fullness, our power, and our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will live in Christ, walk in Christ, and serve in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As Christians we must be filled and saturated with the Spirit, and we must also experience being baptized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must have such experiences of the Holy Spirit in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then Christ will be everything to us both inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this message we would like to see something concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit, or being clothed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to see the need for the baptism in the Spirit, let us use the following illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose there was a man who was full of food but was not adequately clothed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a man would be very abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Inwardly, he would be full and satisfied, but his outward condition would be abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In such a condition, he would not be able to do anything outside his house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From this we can see that with respect to the matter of life, it is sufficient to have Christ in us as our life, but for our service we must put on Christ as our clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we were clothed but had nothing inside, our outward condition would be proper, but our inward condition would be abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, if we were full within but had nothing with which to cover ourselves, our inward condition would be satisfactory, but our outward condition would be abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be a normal Christian, we must be filled with Christ as life inwardly and clothed with Christ as power outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must live by Christ as our food and drink, and we must serve with Christ as our clothing to cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we will be fully mingled with Christ; Christ will be in us Gal 2:20 , and we will be in Christ John 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what it is to be a normal Christian, one who is normal in life as well as service.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INWARD FILLING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>AND THE OUTWARD FILLING</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are two different words in the Greek language for the word fill.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Greek word pleroo denotes the action of filling something within.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Greek word pletho implies the action of outpouring, of filling something outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Greek language these two words are clearly distinct from each other, but in English they are both translated fill.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Acts 2:2 and 4 we see these two different words used.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 2 says, Suddenly there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The word for filled in this verse is a form of the Greek verb pleroo, indicating that the house was inwardly filled.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 4 says, They were all filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word for filled in this verse is a form of the Greek verb pletho, indicating that the disciples were outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because the house in which the disciples dwelt was inwardly filled with the Spirit, the disciples were surrounded and outwardly filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is similar to our baptism in water.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we were baptized in the baptistery, which was inwardly filled with water, we were also filled with water.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, we were filled outwardly, not inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is not an inward matter but an outward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just as the water of baptism is outside of us and not inside of us, the Holy Spirit of baptism is outside of us and not inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Inwardly, we must be filled with the Holy Spirit, but outwardly, we must be clothed with and immersed in the Holy Spirit.</S>
