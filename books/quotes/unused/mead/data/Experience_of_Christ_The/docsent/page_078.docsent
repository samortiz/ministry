   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO KINDS OF SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point we need to differentiate between two kinds of sufferings, the sufferings of Christ and the sufferings that come from our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not think that all the sufferings you undergo are for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, you may suffer because you make a mistake in driving.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps you make a wrong turn and go several miles out of the way, and this causes you to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This suffering, however, is the result of a mistake or carelessness; it is not the suffering of Christ for the producing of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Likewise, if you make an error in your financial records and find yourself several hundred dollars in debt, that is also the suffering caused by error, not the suffering Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, suppose on your job you enjoy the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of this certain of your superiors oppose you, either passing you up for a promotion or causing you to be dismissed from your job.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This suffering may be counted as the suffering of Christ for the producing and building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, one category of suffering is due to our mistakes and wrongdoings, and the other results from our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we set ourselves aside and experience the power of resurrection, our testimony will be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This will arouse the opposition of the enemy, and we shall suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of suffering is the suffering of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all need to know the fellowship of Christ's sufferings, the sufferings that make up what is lacking of Christ's sufferings for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This should be not merely doctrine, but an experience in which we enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CHRIST LIVING HIS LIFE IN US</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Gospels reveal that the Lord Jesus was always suffering opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In suffering opposition, we experience Christ and enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By experiencing and enjoying Him in this way, we come to know Him experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more we pass through death, the more Christ's resurrection power becomes our enjoyment; and the more we have the enjoyment of resurrection power, the more we know Christ by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, the very Christ whose life is recorded in the four Gospels lives His life again in us and in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we know Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Christ revealed in the Gospels becomes our experience, and we follow in His footsteps as He repeats His life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because He repeats His life in us, we become one with Him in His steps.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We follow Him by enjoying Him and by being one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that we even follow Him in His suffering life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you read the book of Acts again, you will see that Peter, James, John, Paul, and all the apostles were such people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Christ revealed in the Gospels was lived out again in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Gospels, Christ lived out Himself in Jesus; in Acts, He lived out Himself in the apostles; and now He intends to live out Himself in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>KNOWING CHRIST EXPERIENTIALLY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should know Christ not only by revelation, thus having the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to know Him also by enjoying Him, by experiencing Him, by being one with Him, and by having Him live within us and walk with us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way we know Him not merely in an objective way, but much more in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, we know Him both by revelation and by experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, He becomes us and we become Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This enables us to say with Paul, "To me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We shall also be able to say that Christ is being magnified in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This book reveals how to know Christ in an experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It tells how to know Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we know Him in this way, we can say, "Christ is being magnified in me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For to me to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we shall go on to say, "Oh, that I may gain Christ and be found in Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, as we shall see in a forthcoming message, we shall be able to say, "I can do all things in Him who empowers me" Phil 4:13, Gk.</S>
