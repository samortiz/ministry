   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>PREFACE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the years leading up to the release of the messages contained in his well-known classic, The Normal Christian Life, Watchman Nee released a series of messages on The Overcoming Life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In many respects these messages provide the basis for a believer to live the normal Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who have read The Normal Christian Life will find that The Overcoming Life speaks with the same freshness, clarity, and surprising originality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Overcoming Life does not present a call to attain an extraordinary measure of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, it is a call to normalcy, a call to pursue the life that is hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This call reverberates within seeking believers who, despite a keen sensitivity to their weaknesses, sense an inward call to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In The Overcoming Life, Watchman Nee outlines the pathway for those who have an ear to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Like a skilled physician, Watchman Nee first exposes the problems besetting seeking Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Using God s Word, he candidly examines the defeated state of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then he presses for a cure, opening up a revelation of the victorious, overcoming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, he guides the reader into a subjective, even daily experience of Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Overcoming Life teems with truth, reverberates with hope, and brings the reader to renewed consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Overcoming Life is a fresh and accurate translation of messages given by Watchman Nee in 1935.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With the exception of chapter four, the messages were delivered in Shanghai during September and October.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapter four was released in Cheunchow, Fukien province, in November of the same year.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is included because of its consistency with both the subject and emphasis of the Shanghai messages.</S>
