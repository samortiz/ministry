<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. One Basket of Very Good Figs</H2><P>"One basket had very good figs, like first ripe figs" (v. 2a). This basket of good figs signifies those Israelites whom the God of Israel had sent from the holy land to the land of the Chaldeans (vv. 2-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Jehovah Regarding Them for Good</H2><P>"Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Like these good figs, so I will regard those who are exiled of Judah, whom I have sent from this place to the land of the Chaldeans, for good" (v. 5). We might think that Jehovah would have no regard for the exiles; however, here we are told that He would regard them for good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Jehovah Setting His Eyes upon Them for Good</H2><P>According to verse 6, Jehovah said that He will set His eyes upon them for good, bring them back to the holy land, build them up and not tear them down, and plant them and not uproot them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Jehovah Giving Them a Heart to Know Him</H2><P>Jehovah also promised that He will give them a heart to know Him, that He is Jehovah. They will be His people, and He will be their God, for they will return to Him with their whole heart (v. 7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Other Basket of Very Bad Figs</H2><P>"The other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten because of their rottenness" (v. 2b). This basket of figs signifies Zedekiah, the king of Judah, his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remained in the holy land and those who dwelt in the land of Egypt (vv. 8-10). Those who were living in Egypt were those who had escaped for security from the holy land to Egypt.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Jehovah Making Them like the Bad Figs</H2><P>Concerning Zedekiah, his princes, the remnant in Jerusalem who remained in the holy land, and those dwelling in Egypt, Jehovah said that He would make them like the bad figs (v. 8).</P>
