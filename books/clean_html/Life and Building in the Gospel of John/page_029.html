<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">RECEIVING OF HIS FULLNESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:16; Col. 2:9-11</h1>
<p>John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; Being full of grace and reality refers to obtaining and enjoying the Lord Jesus, who is the fullness of God (v. 16). When we obtain grace and touch reality, God&rsquo;s glory is manifested through the Lord. This is the reason that John says, &ldquo;We beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father&rdquo; (v. 14).</p>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the phrase <em>of His fullness we have all received</em> in verse 16. According to the sentence structure in the Greek text, this phrase is connected to the phrase <em>full of grace and reality</em> in verse 14 because verse 15 is an inserted word. Hence, the fullness spoken of in verse 16 is actually the grace and reality mentioned in verse 14. Of His fullness, that is, of His grace and reality, we have all received.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULLNESS OF THE LORD BEING<br />
THE CONTENT OF GOD</h2>
<p>Although we say that fullness is equal to grace and reality, we may not be fully clear about the significance of this matter. John used a special term <em>fullness</em> to show that the fullness we have received from the Lord is just the content of God. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; The fullness of Christ is equal to the content of God.</p>
<p>Many Christians associate fullness and grace with material things on earth. For example, a person may testify, &ldquo;Formerly, I had a hard life because what I earned could not cover my rent. But God is blessing me now, and my financial situation has changed completely. I have a nice house for myself and two other houses to rent. Furthermore, I am building another house. I have truly received of His fullness, even grace upon grace.&rdquo; Many of us have heard such testimonies.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, I was living in Tsingtao. One day a brother came to see me. I asked him about his business, and he responded, &ldquo;Oh, I have received of the Lord&rsquo;s fullness with grace upon grace. Although business is somewhat slow, my inventory in Tsingtao and Shanghai is quite good, and I have a branch office in Tsinan. Furthermore, there is sufficient revenue. This is truly grace upon grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another occasion I was invited to a brother&rsquo;s home for a meal. I had met this brother when his children were young. When I went to his house to eat, his children were adults. I asked about his children, and he said, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! We have all received of His fullness and grace upon grace. My oldest son has graduated from a university, and my younger son has graduated from another university. Not only so, they are both married.&rdquo; When his daughters-in-law came into the room, he introduced them to me, telling me from which college they had graduated. Then he called his grandchildren over and said, &ldquo;These are my grandchildren. See how gracious God has been to me these years. This is truly grace upon grace.&rdquo; After listening to him, I did not know whether to be upset because this brother was blind to the true meaning of grace or amused because the earthly fullness that this brother had was not the fullness spoken of by the apostle John. In Paul&rsquo;s eyes this brother&rsquo;s &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; was refuse (Phil. 3:8). It was not grace upon grace but refuse upon refuse. This is the pitiful situation of many Christians today.</p>
<p><em>Grace</em> in John 1:16 does not refer to material things, and <em>His fullness</em> does not refer to having a family with good children and grandchildren, a storehouse filled with goods, or a handful of houses. His fullness is not any of these things. The Lord&rsquo;s fullness is the rich content of all that God is, and this fullness dwells in Christ bodily. Fullness does not refer to material things.</p>
<p>The fullness is nothing other than the element of God Himself, the content of what God is. The entire Gospel of John is needed in order to explain the introductory word in 1:1-18. Because verse 16 says, &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received,&rdquo; we should be able to find references to the content of this fullness throughout the entire Gospel of John. Of all the four Gospels, only the Gospel of John describes the Lord Jesus in relation to so many items.</p>
<p>This Gospel speaks of the Lord Jesus in reference to life, grace, reality, the way, and light (1:4, 14; 14:6; 8:12). In fact, there are at least thirty-one items related to the Lord Jesus; sixteen of these items are in chapter 1 alone. He is the Word (v. 1); God (v. 1); life (v. 3); light (v. 4); flesh (v. 14); the tabernacle (v. 14); grace (v. 14); reality (v. 14); the only Begotten of the Father (vv. 14, 18); the Son of God (vv. 34, 49); the Lamb (v. 29); the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit (v. 33); Christ, the Messiah (v. 41); a man, a Nazarene (v. 45); a king, the King of Israel (v. 49); and the Son of Man (v. 51).</p>
<p>In addition to these items, there are at least another fifteen items. The Lord Jesus is the temple (2:21), the Bridegroom (3:29), the One who came from above (v. 31), the One who is above all (v. 31), the One who gives the Spirit not by measure (v. 34), the One who inherits all things (v. 35), the living fountain (4:14), the Savior of the world (v. 42), the bread of life (6:35), the door of the sheep (10:9), the good Shepherd (v. 11), resurrection (11:25), a grain of wheat (12:24), the way (14:6), and the vine (15:1). These items and the items in chapter 1 add up to thirty-one items. If we want to know the fullness in the Lord Jesus, we need to know these thirty-one items. Every item speaks of His content, and this content is related to His fullness, which we cannot exhaust in our experience.</p>
