   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TAKING NOTES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While we are reading the Bible, we have to jot down notes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every student of the Bible has to take notes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need small notebooks, and we need big notebooks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should always carry a small notebook in our pocket to jot down our thoughts all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should also jot down our questions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition to the small notebook, we should also carry a bigger, consolidated notebook.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should write down systematically in this consolidated book all the things that have passed through our mind and all the materials we have collected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to categorize this information for future reference.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the beginning we do not need a detailed division; the categorization can be somewhat general.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we want to categorize our material by theological subjects, we can divide it into five sections, concerning the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the church, and the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is all right to make finer divisions, but for new believers, these five categories will suffice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Prophecies concerning the church can be grouped under the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the doctrines from justification to sanctification also can be grouped under the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the beginning we can have five notebooks, one for each of these five categories.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we have more material, we can make further subdivisions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must exercise care in taking notes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, in reading Romans, we should note that reign or reigning is used five times in 5:14, 17, and 21.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Much more is used four times in verses 9, 10, 15, and 17.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to make a note of all of these.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mark 13:9 says, "For My sake," verse 13 says, "On account of My name," and verse 20 says, "On account of the chosen."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why do these three verses say these three different things?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Consider the example of Matthew 24 and 25.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How many questions did the disciples ask the Lord on the Mount of Olives?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How many verses answer one question, how many answer another?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The disciples were limited in their knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their questions were not that pertinent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the reason not much is recorded concerning their questions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the Lord Jesus spoke a great deal in His answers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to pay attention to this speaking and find out from which verse to which verse are Jesus' answers and from which verse to which verse are His additional words.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way, we will have a thorough grasp of the whole prophecy on the Mount of Olives.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Consider the three occurrences of "I said" in Isaiah 6:5, 8, and 11.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first "I said" is a confession, the second "I said" is a consecration, while the third "I said" is a fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to take note of all of these.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This kind of material is very useful to us as well as to other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All good readers of the Bible are diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They do not become good by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>TOOLS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Studying the Bible is like working at a trade; we have to have the proper tools.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A. The Bible</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should have two large-print Bibles for our own reading.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We also should have a small-print Bible for our travel and for meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we cannot have two Bibles for our own reading, we should at least have one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The print should not be too small, because if it is too small, it will be easy to miss the meanings in the words.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The font must at least be size five.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Preferably it should be size four or three.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Size two is too large, and it is suitable only for elderly ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Translator's note: These sizes refer to Chinese typesetting conventions, with the higher the size, the smaller the print.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The English equivalent of size five is approximately nine points, and the equivalent of size two is approximately twenty-four points.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is best to have two Bibles for studying.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In one of them we can put marks and notes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The other should be left unmarked.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By reading an unmarked Bible, we will not be affected by our previous readings, and every time we read a passage, it will be like reading it for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The other Bible should be used for marking and underlining.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can write notes, underline and circle words, or link similar passages together.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But we should not spend too much time or be too detailed in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For our daily spiritual nourishment, we can use the unmarked Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For research, we can use the marked Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Chinese Union Version is the best Chinese translation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is also one of the best translations of the Bible in the world available today.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One of the reasons for this is that it is based on the best edition of the Greek text.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This translation is very accurate in many places, even more accurate than the King James Version.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, the King James Version in many instances does not distinguish between "Jesus Christ" and "Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the Chinese Union Version is always accurate in the order of the two expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is good to buy several different translations and compare them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Another good translation is the Wen-li classical Union Version.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In many instances, its monosyllabic terms are better than those used in the Chinese Union Version.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The vernacular Chinese language does not express itself as well as the classical Chinese language when it comes to terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For example, both "making alive" and "raising up" are translated as fu-hwo in vernacular Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But the classical Chinese makes a distinction between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One is fu-chi and the other is fu-hwo.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In some cases the vernacular Chinese is more restricted than the classical Chinese, and in some other cases, the opposite is true.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Another version worth considering is the Joseph ?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Version.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He was a Jew, and after he became a Christian, he felt the need to translate the Bible into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>For that very purpose he studied Chinese and later did a translation all by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We can also compare the New Testament translation of the "Shin-Ju-Ku" Version.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Christian Gospel Bookroom has also done a translation of the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It can be used for reference as well.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The most reliable versions, however, are still the Chinese Union Version and the Wen-li Union Version.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If a person can read English, he can also try to have a copy of Darby s translation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>B. Concordances</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Other than the Bible, one should also have a concordance.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Courtenay H. Fenn's compilation is probably one of the better ones.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Yet even this one is not too complete.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the future we hope to publish a concordance according to the original Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Lord willing, we will publish an Old Testament concordance as well.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>C. Bible Dictionaries</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In addition to the above tools, we should also have Bible dictionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>For example, we need a dictionary to tell us the meaning of Urim and Thummim, the histories of the six Marys, etc. A dictionary can give us all this information.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But we should use a dictionary whose doctrinal conviction is sound.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>One can consult the Bible Encyclopedia by Ou-Er.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This can be considered a Bible dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Unfortunately, its Chinese version is out of print.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Perhaps one can still find a copy of it in the library or in old bookstores.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>D. Outlines of the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We need another book to help us make good outlines of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We can consult Once a Year through the Bible see Volume 2 of The Collected Works .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This book has good outlines.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Many Christians all over the world have used the divisions outlined in this book for their study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>These reference books are useful to us in our study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>They are indispensable tools.</S>
