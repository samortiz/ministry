   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE KING'S ANTECEDENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND STATUS 6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 1 is a chapter of names.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have spent considerable time on the names of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and even on the names of Tamar and Rahab.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The last two names, however, Jesus and Emmanuel, are more than wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the last part of Matthew 1 seems to deal with the birth of Christ, it actually deals with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message I am burdened to give you a hint concerning how to dwell on these names.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>J. Jesus, the Name Given by God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel was the name called by man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The angel Gabriel told Mary that the child she would conceive was to be called Jesus Luke 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph and also told him to call the child Jesus Matt 1:21, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, Jesus was a God-given name.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Three Elements in the Name of Jesus a. Jehovah "I Am That I Am"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The name Jesus includes the name Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Hebrew, the name God means the mighty One, God the Almighty; and the name Jehovah means I Am I Am That I Am Exo 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The verb "to be" in Hebrew not only refers to the present, but also includes both the past and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the correct meaning of Jehovah is I Am That I Am, the One who is now in the present, who was in the past, and who will be in the future and in eternity forever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the name of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only God is the eternal One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From eternity past to eternity future, He is the I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus could say of Himself, "Before Abraham came into being, I am" John 8:58 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also said to the Jews, "Unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins," and, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am" John 8:24, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must realize that Jesus is the great I Am and believe in Him as the great I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the name of the Lord is the I Am, we may say, "Lord, You told me that Your name is I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then, what are You?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His answer will be, "I am whatever you need."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord is whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we need salvation, He Himself will be salvation to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have a signed check with the space for the amount left blank, and we may fill in whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we need one dollar, we may insert one dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if we need one million dollars, we may insert one million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we feel that we need one billion, we simply fill in this amount.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The check covers whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever you need, Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you need light, life, power, wisdom, holiness, or righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jesus Himself is light, life, power, wisdom, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything we need is found in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How high and how rich is this wonderful name!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Savior</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first element included in the name of Jesus is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The second is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus is Jehovah-Savior, the One who saves us from all negative things: from our sins, from hell, from God's judgment, and from eternal condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He saves us from everything God condemns and from everything we hate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we hate our temper, He will save us from it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He saves us from the evil power of Satan, from all our besetting sins in our daily life, and from every bondage and addiction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hallelujah, He is the Savior!</S>
