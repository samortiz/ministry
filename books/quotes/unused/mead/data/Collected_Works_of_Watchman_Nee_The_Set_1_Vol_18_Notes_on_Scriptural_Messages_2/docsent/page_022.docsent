   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NARRATION OF THE PAST Issue No. 33 Scripture Reading: Acts 14:26-27</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This morning, we would like to follow the example of the apostles in a small, insignificant, and humble way to speak about what God's grace has done through us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, we will not speak about any doctrine today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, we will relate some stories.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A few days ago, we read the News Magazine, Issue No. 1517, page 7, which had an article on church news.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The title of the article was "Conference of Western and Chinese Believers of the Little Flock."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It mentions something concerning myself and the conference we had.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The writer of this article was very polite, and he did not seem to have an evil intention towards us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, what was reported, perhaps collected from interviews, was somewhat inaccurate in some of the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From his words we know that the writer is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So within the next week, I will write a letter to him to inform him of some corrections.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the time of the printing of this magazine, the letter has been sent, but I have not seen it published yet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The reason I want to speak about our past is that I hope the brothers and sisters among us today will not be robbed to follow others in calling ourselves the "Little Flock."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those brothers and sisters among us who are somewhat familiar with our history will, of course, not be affected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But because some brothers and sisters have only been with us for a few months and do not know our past history, I am afraid that some of them will be a little confused.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why I want to take this opportunity to speak to all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many brothers and sisters are not clear about our background, our work, and everything about us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people do not know our history; therefore, I have to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Three years ago I had to go back to Foochow because of my health.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some brothers and sisters at that time wanted me to tell them something concerning the work between 1922 and 1923.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They asked how it was at the beginning, how we fought the battles, and what the testimony of the truth was.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I will take this opportunity to speak about how the Lord showed us the truth and how He led us on in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hopefully, this will make them the Foochow brothers and the brothers and sisters here in Shanghai more clear.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to pay attention to our words and attitude in order to prevent others from calling us the "Little Flock."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we have already considered ourselves the "Little Flock," we cannot, of course, blame others for calling us the "Little Flock."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By relating the story of our past, perhaps we can avoid much misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, it is difficult to speak about the things of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, many battles were fought in many areas at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we mention names, it will hurt others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, many of the past events have to do with me personally.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Third, anytime anyone speaks about the past, there is always the subjective influence of his background.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, if we ask a brother from Nanking to say something, he will surely speak about God's leading, and how he has been taking this way in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we ask a brother from Amoy to speak, he will surely speak about the way he sought after the Lord in Amoy and how he obeyed God to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, whenever people speak about past events, personal flavors and personal backgrounds unavoidably come in. This is what I would like to avoid.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I would like to reduce my personal flavor to a minimum.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The name Watchman Nee should be cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have said this before, and I will say it again today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that personal flavor would be reduced to a minimum.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the same time, I would like to tell everyone our history.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I will now read to you the article in News Magazine:</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The origin of this congregation began with a Fukienese believer called Nee To-sheng.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Around 1922 to 1923, he came to Shanghai to establish his congregation and propagate his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He based his principle strictly on the original text of the Bible, but was not well received by the Shanghai community.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of the political turmoil, he was not able to establish anything, and subsequently returned to Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later he started The Christian magazine, which became very popular and widely circulated.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later, the magazine changed its name to The Present Testimony, which was also quite appealing and widely circulated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the same time, he returned to Shanghai and gathered his few affiliates, purportedly to pray, while substantively expounding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Three years ago, they set up their meeting place in Wen-teh Lane of Hardoon Road in West Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the beginning the number was not big, and they called themselves the "Little Flock."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They meet about ten times every week.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During the past three years, over ten Presbyterian congregations in Kiangsu, another ten or more China Inland Mission congregations in Chekiang, a few independent congregations in Yun- chia and Pingyang in Chekiang, plus a few other congregations in Fukien who were of the same mind were all affected by him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They all overthrew their original denominational names and changed the pastoral system to come under the banner of the "Little Flock."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This season, as a result of a visit by six men from Australia, including a Dr. Powell, a missionary Mr. House, businessmen Mr. Joyce and Mr. Phillip, and two female believers who arrived from London, there was a gathering of the affiliates from Kiangsu, Chekiang, Fukien, and Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The attendance was about two hundred, with Wen-teh Lane hosting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The meetings lasted from November 7th to the evening of the 13th.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every day there were three meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I was able to attend the meetings as an observer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every day Mr. Nee was the main speaker, while the Western and the Chinese believers engaged in discussions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A Mr. Chang and Mr. Chao were the translators.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The morale was rich and sweet, and one came away with much help.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This report is well-intentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But as far as the facts are concerned, it is mostly inaccurate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is why I have to relate to you the real facts so that you will know God's leading among us.</S>
