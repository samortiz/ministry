The first is Isaac's relationship with Abraham, and the second is Isaac's relationship with God.</p><h2 class="head2">Isaac's Relationship with Abraham</h2><p>Genesis 24:36 says, "And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath." This son was Isaac. Isaac means that we do not do anything ourselves or seek for anything ourselves. Isaac is the enjoyment of everything of Abraham. Everything is from the father. "Unto him hath he given all that he hath."</p><p>Read 25:5 again. "And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac." Isaac received nothing and acquired nothing through his own efforts. His prosperity had nothing to do with himself; it was from God. The Bible shows us that Isaac's characteristic was to inherit. Everything he had was from his father. He did not have to do anything. His father came to Canaan; he was born in Canaan. He did not have to worry about anything.</p><h2 class="head2">Isaac's Relationship with God</h2><p>Isaac's relationship with Abraham was one of receiving. What was Isaac's relationship with God? Genesis 26:2-3 says, "And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of. Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries." If we stopped here, we would think that God had established a direct relationship with Isaac and had made a covenant with him. But then God clearly said, "And I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father." God did not bless Isaac because of himself, but because of his father Abraham. God's oath was given to Isaac's father. Now God was blessing Isaac as a confirmation of the covenant. Verse 4 says, "And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." God had spoken these words to Abraham (22:17-18). He did not give anything new to Isaac. He gave to Isaac what He had already given to Abraham. How could all the nations of the earth be blessed? Genesis 26:5 says "Because that Abraham"; it was not because of Isaac but because of Abraham. God says that He is first the God of Abraham and then the God of Isaac. Genesis 26:24 says, "And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father." This is the relationship between God and Isaac. Then God said, "Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake." God's Word shows us clearly that Isaac's relationship with God was based on Abraham's relationship with God. God blessed Isaac because he was the son of Abraham. God was the God of Abraham his father. Therefore, He blessed Isaac.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYTHING WITH ISAAC BEING RECEIVED</h2><p>From these two relationships, we can see Isaac's characteristics. Throughout his entire life, everything he had was a matter of enjoyment and receiving. What does it mean to know the God of Isaac? Knowing the God of Isaac means only one thing: knowing God as the Supplier and that everything comes from Him. If we want to know the Father, we have to know the Son. In order to know the God of Abraham, we have to know the God of Isaac. We are helpless if we only know the God of Abraham because He dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16). But thank the Lord that He is also the God of Isaac. This means that everything that Abraham had was Isaac's. It also means that everything comes by receiving.</p><p>If a Christian does not know the God of Isaac, he cannot go on. If a Christian does not know the meaning of Isaac, he cannot reach God's goal. In other words, if we do not know how to receive, we will never reach God's goal. Those who do not know Isaac can live only under Mount Sinai. Those who do not know Isaac in life and do not express Isaac in living possess nothing but the law. When God has a demand, they try to do it according to themselves. When God wants something, they try to offer it according to themselves. This is not Isaac. This kind of Christian eventually can only sigh and say, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not" (Rom. 7:18). The person in Romans 7 was willing to do good; he was very desirous of being good. But he himself was doing the work; he did not see that God must deliver him. He did not see that everything is in Christ, and he did not see the riches God has prepared in Christ. He did not see the inheritance in Isaac. He did not realize that the secret to victory is in receiving. He did not realize that Christians are Christians by virtue of who they are; they do not act out the Christian life. He did not see that God delivers a person by giving him the law of life. Therefore, he could only exercise his will.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
