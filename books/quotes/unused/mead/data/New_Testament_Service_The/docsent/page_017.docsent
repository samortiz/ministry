   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NICODEMUS AND THE PHARISEES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John chapter seven there is another case of finding Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ was doing some marvelous things, and the people were saying, This is truly the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Others said, This is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Still others said, Does then the Christ come out of Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Has not the Scripture said that Christ comes from the seed of David, and from Bethlehem? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>40-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yes, the Scripture does say that; the people were one hundred percent right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, they missed the mark by being right.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If they did not know the Bible so well, I believe it would have been easy for them to grasp the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were frustrated by their Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yes, He was born in Bethlehem, but He was raised in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such a situation confounds the natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we merely hold the Bible in our hand, we may miss Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to follow the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then Nicodemus, who had come to know Christ somewhat, began to argue with the Pharisees, but they protested, Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee v. 52 . They were right; not even the least prophet came out of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not say, Search and look, but Come and see!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we search and look, we may miss the mark; we may miss Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ was right there; yet they said, Search and look.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is also the possibility in today s situation that Christians would miss Christ in a similar way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may give our attention to the Scriptures and say, Has not the Scripture said?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, we may miss Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here is the Bible, and here is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not be those who care for the Bible but fail to care for Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Oh, it is possible to be so right, but wrongly right!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may be right, but we are only partly right; eventually we may not be right, for we may miss the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord acts in a sneaky way to those who feel that they are so right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He does it purposely: He does not want us to have only the knowledge, and then go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He wants us to be alert at all times lest by knowing the Bible only in that way we lose His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Oh, it is possible to lose the presence of the Lord simply by knowing the Bible only in the letter!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I would rather lose the knowledge of the Bible and keep the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not think that, as long as we are scriptural, we are all right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regardless of how scriptural we may be, if we lose the presence of the Lord, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Knowledge alone does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It did not work with the scribes, the chief priests, and the Pharisees, and it will not work for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is the New Testament way to find the Lord and serve Him?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is continually to keep His presence, His hidden presence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He prophesied that He would come out of Bethlehem, but He came out of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should give up our searching, for God can never be understood by searching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am not searching; I am seeing, I am enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many things I do not understand and I do not care to understand, but I am enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord s presence is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Isaiah 45:15 tells us that He is a hidden God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is a God that hides Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to learn to praise Him, to see Him, to trace Him, and to find Him, but we should not try to understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not qualified to understand Him; we are only qualified to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we should encourage others to Come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>AFTER THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who come to see should not see Christ after the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When Jesus came into His own country, the people said, Is not this the carpenter s son?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And his sisters, are they not all with us?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Matt 13:55-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It seemed that they knew everything, but this was the knowledge of Jesus according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Matthew 22:43 we read that David in spirit called Him Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not follow those people in the flesh, but follow David in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now let us apply this practically to the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you would come to see the local church for example, the church in Los Angeles that is good.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, you should not see it after the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you see it according to the flesh, you will say that there are many peculiar people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not know any man after the flesh, but should know one another after the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once we knew Christ after the flesh and considered Him the little man of Nazareth, but now we know Him no longer in this way 2 Cor 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We know Him after the spirit; in spirit we call Him Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should forget about the outward things, forget about the flesh; we need to see the church not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you beheld the tabernacle in the Old Testament outwardly, you could only see the outer badger skins Exo 36:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is no beauty with the badger skin; it is quite mean and common.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What, however, was within the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There was gold, there was silver, and there were the precious stones; there was the beauty of the precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Would you rather see the church outwardly or inwardly?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Outwardly speaking, the church is clothed with badger skin there is no beauty, but there is toughness and even perhaps wildness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Within, however, there is something of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Within, there is Jesus; within, we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How can we find Christ and serve Him according to the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Yes, we need the Bible, but we also need to see the living star.</S>
