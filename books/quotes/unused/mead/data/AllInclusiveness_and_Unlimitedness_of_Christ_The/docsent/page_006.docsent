   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Triune God the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, this God is of three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This title clearly shows us God in His three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The God of Abraham is God the Father, the God of Isaac is God the Son, and the God of Jacob is God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jacob was a hard case, but God the Spirit came specifically to deal with such hard cases.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In his entire life, Jacob was under the transforming work of God the Spirit, and eventually, he became Israel, the prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Triune God is just one God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is one, yet He has the aspect of three: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father is the Planner, the Designer, and the One who purposed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Son is the Accomplisher and the Finisher, and the Spirit is the Executor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Father came forth in the Son to accomplish what He had planned, and the Son, after accomplishing everything, came into us as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, God is triune that He may enter into us to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This One whom we enjoy as the Triune God is all-inclusive and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we enjoy Him, we enjoy both His all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all have to know Him to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. The Angel of Jehovah, the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This Jehovah who is self-existing and ever-existing, the Triune God, also came to be an Angel, a sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He Himself came to be His own sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This Angel of Jehovah, this One who was sent by Jehovah, was the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to understand that this One is our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, Exodus 3 is very simple with only a few verses concerning Him, but on the other hand, these verses are all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is self-existing and ever-existing, He is the I Am, and He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is also the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Finally, He is His own Angel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are the aspects of Christ as God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A MAN OF BLOOD AND FLESH IN TIME A CREATURE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Another aspect of what Christ is, is that He is man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As God, He is related to us not directly but indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Two thousand years after He created man, He came to tell Abraham, "Abraham, I will cause you to have a seed who will be a blessing to the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who was this seed?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul told us later that this seed was Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Matthew 1:1 says, "Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This son of Abraham is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the promise was given, another two thousand years passed, and when human history fully reached four thousand years, He came.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How did He come?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is marvelous that He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and the Spirit is for reaching man; when He reached man, He came as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Holy Spirit came upon an unmarried woman, a pure virgin named Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He entered into the womb of this virgin and was conceived there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This almighty God, the Triune God, the Lord who is self-existing and ever-existing, the eternal Lord, entered into the womb of a little virgin for His conception, and He remained in the womb for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was there fully abiding by the natural laws that He had ordained in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the natural laws set up by Him, human conception must take nine months, so He waited there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then He was born of the virgin to become a man of blood and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This man had a nose, eyes, skin, flesh, bones, and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be sure, He was a man, but this man possessed not only the human nature but also the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The conception of Christ was a mingling of two natures, divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the elements within Him were divinity mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For this reason, Isaiah 9:6 says that the child born in the manger was the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This One was the God-man, who was both God and man and who was God yet man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A. Being the Complete God Who Became Flesh, Possessing the Complete Divine Nature</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This God who was conceived in humanity is not a partial God but the complete God, the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We Christians often have a wrong natural concept, thinking that the Lord Jesus became flesh as the Son of God only.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You must know that there is no such statement in the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The New Testament says that in the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God, and the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, the Word is not a partial God, but the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was not God the Son only; rather, He was God the complete Triune God God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, He possessed the complete divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is why Paul said in Romans 9:5 that Christ is God over all, blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our Lord Jesus is not the Son of God only.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is God, even the complete God.</S>
