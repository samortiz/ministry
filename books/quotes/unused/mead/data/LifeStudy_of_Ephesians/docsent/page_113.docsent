   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:3 Paul says that by revelation the mystery was made known to him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do you think that the mystery has been made known only to the Apostle Paul and not been made known to all the other New Testament believers?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all have received the revelation of the mystery, the very revelation given to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reason Paul wrote the book of Ephesians was so that all the saints might know the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the years the Lord s recovery has been in this country, the saints have seen more and more of the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By receiving this revelation, we are constituted apostles and prophets, and we are qualified to speak concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As prophets, we need to speak to those around us, regardless of whether we think that they understand what we are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our responsibility is to speak wherever we are at home or at our places of employment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are parents need to speak to their children concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We also should contact our parents and relatives and tell them what we have seen regarding God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not be concerned about what others may think of you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Speak so that the unbelievers may be brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not speak, how can others be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we speak, at least some of those who hear us will come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What an impact there will be if all the saints in the Lord s recovery open their mouths and speak concerning Christ and the church!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many of us have been cheated by the enemy into thinking that we are not qualified to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not expect brothers with certain outstanding gifts to do all the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This concept is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As those who have received grace and who have seen the revelation of the mystery of Christ, we are today s apostles and prophets, and we can speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>ALL SERVING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 3:7 Paul said, Of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God, which was given to me according to the operation of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Greek word translated minister in this verse is the same word that is elsewhere in the New Testament rendered deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In fact deacon is the anglicized form of the Greek word used here.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A minister or deacon is a serving one, not a high official.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this verse Paul was saying that he became a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the natural concept, the ministers are above the elders, and the elders are above the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we have the proper understanding of this verse, we shall see that the ministers actually are deacons, those who serve.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word minister is a good word, but its meaning has been spoiled by traditional usage.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the New Testament, to say that one is a minister is to say that he is simply a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All believers in Christ are serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE OPERATION OF GOD S POWER</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 3:7 Paul speaks of the operation of God s power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the power of the resurrection life Phil 3:10 , which operates within the apostle and all the believers Eph 1:19; 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By such an inward operating power of life, the gift of grace was given to the apostle; that is, it was manifested in him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Greek word rendered operation in verse 7 is the word from which the English word energy is derived.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Within us and among us there is a divine energizing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This operation, this energizing, was not exclusively for the Apostle Paul; it is for all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is proved by 4:16, which, using the same Greek word, speaks of the operation in measure of each one part.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The very same energizing that was in Paul is in every part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such an energy is working within us today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE DISPENSATION OF THE MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 3:9 Paul speaks of bringing to light what is the dispensation of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word dispensation here refers to the process of dispensing Christ as life, as the life supply, and as everything to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all have a part in such a marvelous dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As believers we need to be brought up to God s standard, the standard set by the Apostle Paul.</S>
