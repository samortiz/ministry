<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>ASCENSION AND PRAYER</h1><h2 class=head1>I. THE ILLUSTRATION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p>In the Old Testament typology, both the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies denote the heavens, or the heavenly realm. The altar of offerings being in the outer court indicates that the cross is accomplished on the earth; whereas, the altar of incense being in the Holy Place indicates plainly that the standing of prayer must be in the heavenly realm. Prayer is not performed in the earthly sphere but in the heavenly sphere. Although we humans are on earth and seem to be praying on earth, every prayer that is acceptable to God should be uttered in the heavenly realm. The outer court is good for offering the sacrifices, not for burning the incense. The burning of incense is to be carried out in the Holy Place. The altar of incense is not positioned in the outer court, but in the Holy Place. This tells us that prayer must be in the heavenly realm.<h2 class=head1>II. THE POSITION OF ASCENSION</h2><p>Resurrection is a life, whereas ascension is a position. Whenever we speak of resurrection, we need to know that it is a matter of life. Likewise, whenever we speak of ascension, we must understand that it is a matter of position. Ephesians 2 says that we the believers having been made alive together with Christ, were also raised, ascended, and seated together with Christ in the heavenlies. To be made alive means to obtain life, to be resurrected is to live in life, and to be ascended is to gain a heavenly standing. However, since we are clearly on earth, how can we be seated together in the heavenlies with Christ? We must know that, in the original Greek, “heavenlies” here does not refer to the physical heaven, but indicates a kind of heavenly state, heavenly atmosphere, and heavenly nature. Location-wise, of course, we are not yet in the heavenlies today; but according to state, atmosphere, and nature, we are definitely in the heavenlies. This is the meaning of the “heavenlies” spoken of in Ephesians 2. We have arrived at such a heavenly nature and heavenly state in the resurrected and ascended Christ. This is our position.<p>Let us give an illustration here. Suppose I visit a United States colony in the Philippines. Here the language, the food, the housing, the people, and everything they do are typical of the United States. Geographically speaking, I am in the Philippines, not the United States; but the atmosphere and nature make me feel that, without a doubt, I am in the United States. Thus, “heavenlies” in Ephesians 2 does not refer to a place but to a kind of atmosphere and nature. Of course, on the other hand, the “heavenlies” also denotes the place. Everyone who prays must see that ascension is a position, and that such a heavenly position means a heavenly atmosphere, a heavenly nature.<h2 class=head1>III. THE AUTHORITY OF ASCENSION</h2><p>The position of ascension produces the authority of ascension. Anyone in any kind of position has the authority which corresponds to that position. Even a servant has the authority as well as the position of a servant. A policeman has the position and the authority of a policeman. A teacher has the position and the authority of a teacher. Therefore, we need to see that ascension is a position, and with such a position there is the corresponding authority. The spiritual life of a Christian is not only a matter of life, but also a matter of position. Hence, it is not only a matter of power but also a matter of authority. Life brings in power; while position brings in authority. Resurrection is a matter of power; whereas, ascension is a matter of authority. In order to have a certain measure or kind of authority you need to be in a certain position. If you are in the heavenly realm, you will spontaneously have the heavenly authority. All our genuine prayers are the exercising of heavenly authority in the heavenly position.
