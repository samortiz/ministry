AND THE SPREAD OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The revelation concerning the new man in Ephesians is high, but Paul&rsquo;s words concerning the practical living of the new man do not seem so high. For example, 4:28 says, &ldquo;He who steals should steal no more.&rdquo; Some may think that this word is quite low. However, if we examine ourselves, we will admit that we all have stolen something. Husbands often steal from their wives, and wives frequently steal from their husbands. Elementary-school students steal chalk from schools or pencils from their classmates. Stealing is prevalent in this world. Nearly every person has stolen something. For this reason, after giving a high revelation concerning the new man, Paul had to say, &ldquo;He who steals should steal no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because we are regenerated, the feeling of our conscience is uplifted and more sensitive. The conscience of a Christian is higher than that of an ordinary human being because the divine life is in us. If we have the testimony of living out the divine life before our parents, siblings, and relatives, our parents may disagree with our believing in Jesus, but eventually they will realize that we have changed. Our parents will even testify of our living to our relatives. This is a preaching of the gospel, not with words but through our living out of the new man. Such a testimony is powerful.</p>
<p>After I was saved, no one taught me how to behave, but the divine life working in me caused me to love the Lord, to read the Bible, and to pray. At that time I was nineteen years old, four years older than my brother. Formerly, we loved to play and have fun. However, after I was saved, I loved to pray and read the Bible instead of playing. I did not advise or exhort my younger brother to follow me, nor did I preach the gospel and testify to him. However, when he saw that I was praying and reading the Bible every day, he began to read the Bible too. As a result, he was also saved. Because I changed, he also changed. Consequently, my mother believed in the Lord. Formerly, regardless of how she disciplined us, she could not subdue us; we were young, strong, and fun-loving boys. However, she was amazed that we began to love to read the Bible and to pray rather than playing and making trouble. Consequently, my mother was also saved. We need such a living and testimony today. We should not only preach the gospel verbally; we should show forth a change in our living. We must live out the new man in our daily life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Preaching of the Gospel<br />
Needing the Living Out of the New Man</h2>
<p>Ephesians reveals a high vision of the Lord creating the new man and of our putting on the new man. Following this vision is the crucial matter of the living out of the new man. On one hand, the new man is universal; on the other hand, the new man is uplifted. The old man is low, but the new man is noble. Because we are the new man, our living must be higher than those who are not part of the new man. The living of the new man is to put off the old man and to continually put on the new man. Because we have put on the new man, we need to live out the new man. In order for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony to spread out from Taiwan, we need to begin to labor in the schools. Taiwan has many schools. Every school is a fishpond, and the young saints who are students are fishermen. These students should seize the good opportunity to fish and should also have the reality, the living, and the testimony of the new man. If every school has some brothers and sisters who put on the new man and live out the new man, a flourishing and glorious situation will be manifested.</p>
<p>The young working saints should receive a burden to go to small towns and work as elementary and middle-school teachers by putting on the new man and living out the new man. Then the gospel will be readily and widely accepted by the people in these small towns. If the children in the schools accept the gospel, they will influence their parents. When the parents observe that the saints have extraordinary character, speech, and conduct, they will inwardly acknowledge that the saints are noble. However, if the living of the saints who go to preach the gospel in small towns is a mess and their living, speech, and conduct are worse than that of an average young person, then our testimony will be annulled.</p>
<p>Those who go to the small towns should not be in a hurry to preach the gospel to people. Instead, they should first live out the life of the new man and let people see that they are different from other teachers. Then the people in the town will realize that our difference is because Jesus is in us, and they will be convinced. If we preach Jesus without living out the new man, our preaching will be ineffective, and we might incur others&rsquo; antipathy. This will be the result if our living is inferior to the living of those who pursue Buddhism and Taoism. Instead of being anxious to put up signboards concerning Jesus, we must first put on the new man and live out the new man.</p>
<p>Similarly, those of you who are young people should not preach to your parents merely with words. If you rush to the meeting hall every day but still live the life of the old man, you will be unsuccessful at convincing others and will also damage the testimony of the Lord. If you live out the life of the new man, your parents will eventually be convinced and sense that you have changed. When they inquire about the reason for your change, you can testify that your change is the issue of believing in the Lord Jesus. Because of their traditions and customs, they may not be able to immediately accept the Lord Jesus; they may even scold you. There is no need to argue, however, because with time they will have a change of heart. In the end you will win their heart, and they will admit that you are noble because you have more love for them and are more considerate toward them. However, this is not your work; it is the Lord Jesus who has worked this out in you. If you have such a testimony, your parents, siblings, and relatives will accept the gospel one by one. If you have such a testimony, you can lead three or five people to be saved every year and produce clusters of fruit.</p>
<p>Because I have traveled to many places in the world and contacted all kinds of people, I can say that the Chinese people have been kept by the Lord. Not many Chinese are superstitious. Although many people in Taiwan observe festivals, they are not very superstitious. The Chinese are practical. First, they pay attention to making a living so that they may live peacefully, dress comfortably, and dwell securely. Second, they pay attention to education or learning a skill so that they may make a living. Third, they pay attention to relationships and to ethics. These are good Chinese traditions. If someone becomes rich but does not honor his parents or is not generous to his siblings, he will be despised. It is easy for the Chinese to accept the gospel because they are very practical-minded and care about making a living, education, and ethics. As long as we have a good testimony before men and they see that we are studious and have good conduct, they will acknowledge that our humanity is uplifted. The way for us to preach the gospel in Taiwan is to put on the new man and live out the new man. Our parents, siblings, relatives, schoolmates, and neighbors are observing our conduct. If we live out the new man, we will be able to bear clusters of fruit. I believe that every young person can easily lead two or three persons to salvation each semester. This depends on whether the young people have the living of the new man.</p>

Loving One Another, and Living Out<br />
the Testimony of the New Man</h2>
<p>God has created the new man, and we can put on the new man in the church, but we need the grace to live out the new man. Our will cannot achieve this, for to will is present with us, but to work out the good is not (Rom. 7:18). Hence, we should not make up our mind to live out the new man. The Lord&rsquo;s grace is sufficient for us (2 Cor. 12:9). If we fellowship often with the Lord and with the brothers and sisters, we will spontaneously live out Christ&rsquo;s excellent virtues from our spirit. This is the living of the new man. This is what the Lord is after today.</p>
<p>Four aspects of education are promoted in the schools: moral education, intellectual education, physical education, and social education. Although there is an aspect of social education in schools, many people cannot work in a group. In the church we do not need to teach how to work in a group, because in Christ we have become one group. When the young brothers and sisters take care of one another and love one another, their parents, siblings, schoolmates, and friends will be convinced by observing the excellent virtues that the young people exhibit as a group. These virtues are lived out by the saints putting on the new man and living out the new man. The new man is not many individual persons; it is a corporate man in Christ. This new man is the church, which is different from a social living. Society is dark, but the church is full of light. This is the testimony of the new man. The new man is a lamp shining in darkness. Many of our relatives and friends are in the darkness of society, but they will be drawn near to this brightly shining lamp, and the church will spontaneously have increase.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>The Age of the One New Man &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
