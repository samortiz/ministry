 <h2 class="head2">B. The Israelites</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. In Their Passing through the Great Tribulation<br />
Some of the Israelites Being Kept and Saved,<br />
but the Majority Perishing</h2>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Ones Who Are Saved Being Those<br />
Who Participate in the New Jerusalem in Eternity</h2>
<p>Revelation contains only two points related to the Israelites. When they are passing through the time of tribulation, some will be kept by God and saved. These saved ones will participate in the New Jerusalem in eternity.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem contains the names of the twelve apostles, representing the church, and also the names of the twelve tribes, representing the chosen people of Israel. The New Jerusalem will be a composition of the church and the Israelites, the two groups of chosen people, to become God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place in the universe and a vessel of God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Gentiles&mdash;the Nations</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Judged and Stricken with Afflictions</h2>
<p>Revelation 6 shows that there have been increasing afflictions on the earth after the ascension of the Lord Jesus. For over two thousand years, these afflictions have become increasingly more severe and common. These afflictions are God&rsquo;s smiting and judging of the people of the world. They also are a tool used by God to open people to His gospel. Many sinners are willing to repent when they are stricken with afflictions; very few are willing to receive the gospel when it is peaceful on earth. Instead, when the earth is stricken with all kinds of disasters, the gospel is easily preached and people are readily saved.</p>
<p>The first matter concerning the Gentiles in Revelation is that they are under judgment and stricken with afflictions. In this age we should not put too much hope in enjoying peace because God has determined that the Gentiles on the earth would be stricken with all kinds of natural disasters and man-made calamities.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Ultimately Being Judged by the Lord&mdash;<br />
the Evil Ones Perishing,<br />
While the Good Ones Being Kept Alive and<br />
Entering into the Millennial Kingdom as Citizens</h2>
<p>Throughout the generations, the Gentiles have been under the judgment of afflictions. Ultimately, when the Lord comes, He will judge them, separating them into evil and good; those who are evil will perish instantly, and those who are good will be citizens in the millennial kingdom. These citizens are the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; in Matthew 25. The evildoers in Matthew 25 are the &ldquo;goats&rdquo; who perish.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. After the Millennial Kingdom,<br />
the Last Rebellious Ones Being Devoured by Fire</h2>
<p>At the end of the millennial kingdom, some of the people who are citizens in the millennial kingdom will be deceived by the devil to rebel against God, and they will be devoured by the fire from God. This is revealed in Revelation 20.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Those Remaining<br />
Becoming the Nations in Eternity,<br />
Being Ruled by the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Revelation 21 says that the nations will walk by the light of the New Jerusalem; this means that the nations will be ruled by the New Jerusalem. At the end of the millennial kingdom, some of the citizens in the millennial kingdom will rebel against God and be devoured by fire; those who do not participate in this rebellion will become the nations in the new heaven and the new earth in eternity, being ruled by the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>All the people in the Bible, from Adam to the New Jerusalem have been mentioned. The beginning of man is with Adam, and man&rsquo;s conclusion is seen in the reigning of the New Jerusalem and the nations under its ruling.</p>
