   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FULL-TIME WORKERS The Need of More Full-Time Workers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord s recovery is in need of more full-time workers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Throughout the years in the United States, we did not promote this, yet a good number of brothers were raised up by the Lord to take the full-time way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we need many more full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to my observation, a number of you who are elders should go full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord knows who you are.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just be faithful to His speaking and His leading to go full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I went to Taiwan in October of 1984, there were very few full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now in Taipei alone, there are at least one hundred full-time workers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Recently, they went to the city every day not to preach, but to speak the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also, some individuals from the small group gatherings joined them mostly in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Within three weeks and with the help of the college students who were on vacation, these full-time workers brought in eleven hundred and four people and all of these were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without time we can do nothing, and our body is fully in time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 12:1 tells us to present our body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, this means to present our time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you do not present your time, how could your body be presented?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may say that you will present your body and reserve your time, but your body goes with your time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, there is the need of a good number of saints who are ready, according to God s sight, to go full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Living of Full-Time Workers</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a great problem concerning full-timers which demands our attention the matter of how to make a living by going full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The strangest thing concerning this is that from Paul s time up to now this problem has never been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament does not give us any kind of resolution to this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul was the foremost apostle 1 Cor 15:10; 2 Cor 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did the top work and the result and the blessing he enjoyed from his work were all on the top.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was highly regarded and respected by all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a one, however, was forced to make tents not only to feed himself but also to feed his co-workers Acts 18:3; 20:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Surely Paul was much wiser than all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why did he not exercise his wise mind to tell all the churches who were under his ministry to donate a certain portion of their proceeds to him?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he had done this, he might have been rich.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He would not have needed to make tents.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those of us who take the full-time way or who are going to take the full-time way have to see something here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul never made such a resolution.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may wonder how you can live if you go full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My answer is this just live.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not say anything to anyone about your need; just live.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you cannot live, go back to work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the denominations have their regulations concerning ways to raise funds to take care of their workers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The China Inland Mission was famous for not having a set system of paying their workers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They trusted in the Lord for their living, but their trusting was corporate not individual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the offerings would come to the central office of the China Inland Mission s headquarters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These gifts would be distributed to all their missionaries by percentage.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every missionary had to be fearful and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A certain missionary living in the interior of China did not know how much money would come into the central office.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If very few offerings came, this missionary may have cause for much concern.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the China Inland missionaries all prayed to the Lord, trusting Him for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the missionaries of other denominations were different from the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their missionaries were promised a certain allowance to take care of the needs of their living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our practice in this matter was not exactly the same as that of the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Nee was the first one among us to take the full-time way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He just lived without any promise from anyone or from any church to support him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He lived by faith and he even told his parents not to take care of him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those of us who went full-time after him followed his pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I must testify that to take this way was really hard.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We never made any arrangement for the church to give us a certain monthly allowance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I began to be full-time in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was not until 1946, by the time I had gone to Shanghai, that the church in Shanghai gave the full-time workers a certain amount of cash every month.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before 1946 I never received any regular supply from any church, even from the church in Chefoo, which I was directly taking care of.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Within the five years I stayed in Chefoo, I cannot remember ever having received some material supply from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You may wonder how I lived in those years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I just lived.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes I lived by poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sometimes I lived by my family s suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But I never made a demand on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I did not tell the church that since I was serving there full-time I needed a living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As full-time workers, if we are short of something, we only tell God and tell our poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is why we have surely seen and experienced some miracles regarding the Lord taking care of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I was once assigned by Brother Nee, the leading one in the work, to move my family from Chefoo to a big city in north China, a port city close to the old capital of Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The cost of living there was very expensive.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I moved there and no church gave me any support.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The assigning work did not say anything about my supply.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>That was our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The work, the ministry, only assigned you work to do.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They never cared for your need.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That was our way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I moved there firstly by myself, and when I looked at the situation in that big city, I realized that in order to travel and visit others I needed a bicycle.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I had only a little over forty dollars in my pocket, which I kept to move my family which included my wife and three children.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I needed a bicycle badly, so I prayed to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I still remember where I kneeled down to ask the Lord to meet my need.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In that prayer I was so clear that the Lord was telling me from within to go to buy a bicycle although I only had a little over forty dollars, which was just enough to bring my wife and three children to be with me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Later, a certain brother went with me to visit another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After visiting that brother, we two brothers went to a food market.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we came out of the market, we saw a new bicycle standing there.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I told the brother with me that this was the kind of bicycle I wanted to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Immediately, the owner came out, and I asked him where I could buy such a bicycle and how much it would cost.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then he told me the place and the price.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We brothers went to that store and there was such a bicycle for sale there, already assembled.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The salesman told me the price was thirty-two dollars, including tax and license.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I paid him the thirty-two dollars and took the bike home.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>After coming back home, I was happy that I had a bicycle which would be so useful to me in that big city.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I went upstairs to the very place where I initially knelt down to pray and gave thanks to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>While I was giving thanks to the Lord, He asked me to count how much money I had received since He told me to buy the bicycle up until the time I paid the thirty-two dollars for it.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>My prayer for the bicycle was on a Saturday when a certain brother came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We had a long talk and when he left he told me he had a letter for me.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Actually, it was not a letter but an envelope, within which was ten dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>On the next day, the Lord s day, I received a two-dollar gift from the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The very next morning, Monday morning, I received some registered mail from another city.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This mail contained a postal money order for twenty dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I and the other brother with me went to the post office that same day to cash that money order.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It was on that Monday that we also saw the bicycle I purchased, and I had not counted the money I had received from the Lord as gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When I added the amounts of ten dollars, two dollars, and twenty dollars, and realized that the Lord had supplied me with thirty-two dollars, the exact amount of the bicycle, I wept before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>How faithful He was!</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is one example among the many ways the Lord took care of my practical needs.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The Lord sovereignly arranged for me to see that bicycle and supplied me with the exact amount for it.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Lord is truly marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This was one of my experiences concerning trusting in the Lord for my living.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>My family and I lived in that large city for one year up until the end of 1936.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>At the end of the year, I received a cable from Brother Nee asking me to come join him for a co-workers conference.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I went to this conference and afterwards I visited quite a number of cities.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I traveled during January and February, not being able to return home until some time in March.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I left my home and my family without much money.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>By that time I had four children.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>One day when I was gone, my wife realized that the next day they would have nothing to live on.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>My wife was not the kind of person who contacted people frequently, so she had no person to pray with.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>She only asked our oldest child, who at that time was about seven, and his sister who was five to pray with her.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>They knelt down by the bed and prayed, Lord, we are in this situation and you know we do not know what to live on tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It was winter at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>That evening it was snowing heavily.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>About ten o clock at night an old sister came in a car to our residence and knocked on the door.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>She came in and told my wife that something was bothering her, telling her to come and see my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Then she said, The Lord told me to come with this, and she gave my wife a large sum of money to take care of her and our children.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This older sister had never had any contact with me.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>She only came to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Neither had she had any talk with my wife before that time, and she had never come to visit us in our house.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>But late in the night, under heavy snowing, she came urgently.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Was this not a miracle?</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>That was the way we passed through to be full-time for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>In conclusion, we who take the way of full-time have no right to ask the church to give us anything.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Whether the church would give or would not give us something is up to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We have no right to ask or, needless to say, to require or demand others to supply our need.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We have only one right to trust in the Lord in suffering poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>I was sick for two and a half years with tuberculosis during the time that the Japanese army invaded China.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>China was in a hard situation in that year of 1943.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The war had been going on for over six years already and the economic situation of China was really poor.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>I was very sick and I needed a lot of good care.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>My wife and my children were in a hard time.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>She and the children began to eat the kind of food which at that time was only good for feeding the pigs.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The poorest people in north China sometimes ate this kind of food.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>My family was also forced at times by being short of supply to eat that kind of pig food.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>And in north China we needed coal to burn in the stoves for cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>My wife went to the seashore like the poor people to pick up things that were carried to the shore by the tide.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>The waves carried a lot of things which would be good for fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>When my sister got to know that, she advised my wife not to do this since only the poor people did this.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>But this was what we suffered in order to serve the Lord with our full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We only have the right to tell the Lord our need, and we only have the right to tell our poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>When I was sent to Taiwan from Shanghai, the church in Shanghai did not give me one dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Brother Nee personally gave me about three hundred dollars, and that was all the money I had when I went to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>When I went to Taiwan, I took my wife, eight children, and two maids.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>The older maid had served my family for three generations.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>She was a widow and it was hard for us to leave her.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>The second maid, a younger sister, served my family in Nanking for some years.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>She was a divorced young lady.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>When we were leaving Shanghai, she cried.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>We were the ones who brought her to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>My wife and I decided that as long as we could go to Taiwan we should also bring her.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>We brought these two maids with us, not for help, but out of love.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Therefore, we had twelve people living together in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>The three hundred dollars I had was only good for us to live on for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>This was all I had to go to Taiwan to begin the work there.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>I never told any co-worker what I needed.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>I never told any church what I needed.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>You all would suppose that I should have been the second one, next to Brother Nee, among the saints who was highly regarded in the recovery, yet this was my financial condition.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>If you demand, require, or even ask others to supply your need, this is absolutely a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>This is not only wrong; this is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>If you cannot go this way of being full-time, go back to work.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>On the one hand, I encourage so many of you to go full-time; but on the other hand, I would advise you that if you go this way, you only have the right to tell your need to the Lord and your poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>Please go back to do a regular job if you cannot take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>Whoever goes full-time should be clear that we have no right to ask anyone to supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>I came to this country and worked so hard for the church in Los Angeles in 1964.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>For that whole year, the church in Los Angeles probably only gave me no more than eight hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>I know this because in 1965 I asked a brother to take care of my income tax.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>He told me that for the whole year of 1964 the church in Los Angeles had not given me over eight hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>On the one hand, this way should be carried out by the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>But on the other hand, all the churches, with all the saints, should be faithful in giving.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>These are two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>The churches with all the saints should be careful, should be diligent, and should be faithful in giving to take care of the need.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>Paul says that all the people working for the gospel have the right to live of the gospel 1 Cor 9:14 , but not according to the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>We are here for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>Even though we do not practice having everything in common, we do practice our faithfulness for His unique purpose on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>I believe the elders should teach the saints concerning these kinds of things quite often to bring them to a full knowledge of the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>I told the saints in the church in Taipei that out of twenty saints there should be one full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>If your church has one hundred, you should have at least five full-timers, but not officially or legally.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>The one who becomes full-time has no right to ask any of the nineteen to take care of him.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>Once I discovered something like this, I would advise that brother to go back to his job.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>It is a shame to tell the supporting ones how much you need.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>This is begging.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>We take the way of living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>You go this way of being full-time because you believe the One whom you serve is the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>You do not trust any human being.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>On the other hand, all the saints should be faithful to give, and the entire church should endeavor to take care of the need of the full-timers.</S>

   <S PAR='200' RSNT='1' SNO='200'>He should not take a way that forces others to talk about him in a negative way.</S>
