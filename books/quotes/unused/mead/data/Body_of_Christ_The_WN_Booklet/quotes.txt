[1]  In other places in the New Testament, the church is called the temple of God, the household of God, etc. But Paul specifically said that the church is the Body of Christ.
[2]  Even if we have all the knowledge there is about the Body of Christ, we still may not have seen the Body of Christ or touched the reality of the Body.
[3]  Romans 12 tells us that the church is the Body of Christ, but it does not explain how the church becomes the Body of Christ.
