   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this chapter we will consider the matter of being fervent for the gospel by preaching in the homes and by spreading through migration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are several hymns in our hymnal that stir up and encourage us to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, Hymns, #921 is a simple and effective hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Stanza 1 and the chorus say, Rescue the perishing, / Care for the dying, / Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave; / Weep o er the erring one, / Lift up the fallen, / Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>PREREQUISITES FOR PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are two prerequisites for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first prerequisite is to be crazy for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whoever preaches the gospel must be crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person who is not crazy cannot preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is difficult for a person who is very rational to lead people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Preaching the gospel requires us to be crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second prerequisite is to be thick-skinned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The countenance or expression of a person who preaches the gospel should not change; otherwise, he cannot preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A gospel preacher must be crazy and not self-conscious; that is, he must be thick-skinned.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are requirements for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I was young, I was embarrassed to meet people or converse with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I avoided guests, and I did not visit people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After I was called by the Lord, I practiced contacting and speaking with people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Initially this was difficult for me, but after practicing for many years, there was some progress.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we want to preach the gospel, we need to be crazy, and we cannot be self-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not become angry when we are rebuked, and we should not be elated when we are welcomed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to be thick-skinned so that our countenance remains unchanged regardless of the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, a crazy gospel preacher must learn to sing gospel songs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not easy for a calm and rational person to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we sing the gospel songs, the crazier we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before I stand at the podium to preach the gospel, I have a time of thorough prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is my secret.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I also exercise to be crazy, but I am not irrational.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more rational a person is, the more he is self-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is difficult for a person who is too self-conscious to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When he sees a relative or a person who has a doctorate degree in the audience, he becomes timid and cannot speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A crazy person can say even to the president, We all need salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only a crazy person has the boldness to preach the gospel to the president.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Dear young brothers and sisters, you should not make plans to go to Africa or India for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, you need to be crazy and preach the gospel in Taiwan first.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This applies especially to those who have consecrated themselves to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The young people need to learn to contact people at school.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are about 120,000 college students, 50,000 high school students, and 50,000 junior high school students in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a total of 220,000 students.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The young full-time serving ones need to go to the various campuses to contact the students.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You should not be crazy the first time you contact a student.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, you need to be proper, but you should not feel ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Gradually, after you have preached the gospel to a certain extent, you will need to be crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to learn to be crazy and thick-skinned because we were not born this way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before we go to a campus, we need to have an adequate time of prayer to pray ourselves into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After we pray thoroughly, we will be crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our spirit will be burning, and our skin will be thickened.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We also need to sing hymns in a released way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can sing short gospel songs, such as Rescue the perishing Hymns, #921 and then You ve fallen into sins Chinese Hymns, #715 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rescue the perishing is concerning our need to preach the gospel, and You ve fallen into sins is about the sinner s need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore, we should be expressive when we sing the hymns, especially the gospel hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rescue the perishing should be sung with a strong voice.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You ve fallen into sins should be sung softly, but the chorus He longs to save you!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>/ He s waiting for you!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>/ Won t you let Him save you / While it s today? should be sung with a strong voice.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Beginning from 1940 I led the brothers and sisters in northern China to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It was in Chefoo that we first used the term the gospel preaching of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At that time, every year we had a four-day gospel campaign of eight sessions.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We used the first four days of the Chinese Lunar New Year and had one session in the morning and another session in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>During those four days I was crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I gave myself fully to preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The only other things that I did were to eat and to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I was so exhausted after every meeting that I could only sleep until the next meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>My whole being was spent on the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Formerly I did not know how to sing, neither could I speak well, but whenever I preached the gospel, I was crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There are several gospel hymns that we sang often in northern China, for example, Hymns, #1044, Are you ready God to meet? and #1080, What profit all the labor here?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After singing these hymns, we felt that everything is vain, including our spouses and children.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This was the result of our singing with expression.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Another hymn we sang often is #309: What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought / Since Jesus came into my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The chorus of this hymn is very releasing; it says, Since Jesus came into my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>/ Since Jesus came into my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>/ Floods of joy o er my soul like the sea billows roll, / Since Jesus came into my heart!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We sang the chorus until it seemed as if our entire being was rolling.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Other hymns we often sang include #930, Must I go, and empty-handed and #918, Christians, make haste, your mission high fulfilling.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The brothers need to learn how to properly lead the singing during the gospel-preaching meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A meeting can be killed or enlivened by the way we lead the saints to sing the hymns.</S>
