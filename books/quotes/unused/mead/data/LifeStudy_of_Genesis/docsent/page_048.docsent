   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gates of Hades Cannot Prevail against the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fulfillment of God's intention in giving man dominion involves Christ as the Head and the church, including all the saints, as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fulfillment of God's intention is not only with the Head, but also with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible does not say the gates of Hades meaning the power of Satan cannot prevail against the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They can prevail against the saints if the saints are separate or individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You need to be built into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Body which is built up with Christ can never be defeated by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan can never prevail against the builded church.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Saints Have Been Given Authority</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>to Bind the Enemy</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The saints have been given authority to bind the enemy Matt 16:19; 18:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word in Matthew 16:19 was spoken to Peter; the word in Matthew 18:18 was spoken to every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Catholic Church claims that Peter had the authority to represent Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They base this on Matthew 16:19.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, we must tell them that we also have Matthew 18:18.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only has Peter been given authority to bind and loose, but we also.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every believer has been given the authority to bind and to loose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, the church with all the saints has the authority to bind and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many times, we should not simply pray; we should bind and loose.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God Will Crush Satan under the Feet</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>of the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 16:20 says, "The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul said, "soon."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I don't know how Paul felt when he said this nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It may seem to us that a long time has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But, we believe, it has not been too long.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Shortly, Satan will be crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word crush not only means to bruise or break, but also to subdue.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan must be under our feet.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In your church life Satan must be under your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have to tell him, "Satan, your position is under my feet."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here and now Satan must be under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>dd.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Saints Have to Fight against the Enemy</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second Corinthians 10:3-5 and Ephesians 6:11-13 tell us that we must fight against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We not only fight, we wrestle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Wrestling is more difficult than fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must wrestle with the evil powers in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>ee.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Overcoming Saints Will Have Authority</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>over the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The overcoming saints will have authority over the nations Rev 2:26-27 and in the millennium they will be kings reigning with Christ over the whole earth Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By that time, God will fully have His dominion on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That will be the fulfillment of what God desired to have in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>ff.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the Saints Will Reign for Eternity</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually, all the saints will reign as kings over the earth for eternity in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time, Satan, the evil angels in the air, and the sea with all the demons will be cast into the lake of fire Rev 20:10, 13-14; Matt 25:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the pollution will be cleared away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The air, the water, and the earth have been polluted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When eternity comes, all the pollution will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everything will be clear, and God's dominion will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's authority will be exercised on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In that realm and in that sphere God's image will be fully expressed and God's glory will be fully manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That will be the eternal kingdom, the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Genesis 1 is a nursery.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the seeds of the truth were sown there.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have seen that the word light was sown in Genesis 1 and developed through all the Bible until Revelation 22 where there is no need for the sun, the moon, or any lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God Himself is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Likewise, the word image first appears in Genesis 1 and is developed throughout the entire Bible until we see the New Jerusalem bearing the image of God, expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the same principle, the word dominion also needs the whole Bible to explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We go from the single word dominion in Genesis 1 to Revelation 22:5 where we see that all the saints will reign with God for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>That will be the ultimate fulfillment of God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Man was made in God's image to express God and was given God's dominion to represent God and to deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today, the church is the great part of the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The church's responsibility and duty is positively to express God and negatively to subdue God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must bear this responsibility.</S>
