   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Considering Him as the Substitute for Sinners</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Forsaking Him as the Unique Sinner</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>at That Moment</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that during the last three hours that Christ was on the cross, Jehovah considered Him as the Substitute for sinners 1 Pet 3:18 and forsook Him as the unique sinner at that moment Matt 27:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How marvelous it is that in this universe there is such a Substitute for you and me!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being Pleased to Crush Him,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>to Afflict Him with Grief</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Isaiah 53:10a, in Christ's vicarious death as the Substitute for sinners, Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>C. Making Himself an Offering for Sin</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaiah 53:10b says that Christ made Himself an offering for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that Christ volunteered to make Himself an offering for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Hebrew the word translated Himself in this verse literally means "His soul."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The composition of this verse can also have the sense of "When His soul would make an offering for sin."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This implies that Christ volunteered to be an offering for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The offering here is not a sin offering but an offering for sin, referring to sin in its totality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, John 1:29, speaking of Christ as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world," does not refer to the sin offering although the sin offering is included there but to an offering for sin in its totality for wrongdoings, mistakes, trespasses, transgressions, evildoings, and iniquities.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through the Eternal Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hebrews 9:14 says that Christ offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the moment the Father condemned Him and forsook Him, the Spirit was still with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the eternal Spirit were not with Him, how could He offer Himself through the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must not forget that in essence God is one, but in doing things, He is three.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His being one God in essence is essential, whereas His doing things as three is economical, for His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In God's economy the Father condemned and forsook the Son, and the Spirit was with the Son to support and strengthen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He was dying on the cross, the Lord Jesus was a human being with flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Surely He felt a great deal of pain as He hung on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He suffered there as a man, and therefore He needed to be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, when the Father forsook Him, the Spirit came to strengthen and support Him.</S>
