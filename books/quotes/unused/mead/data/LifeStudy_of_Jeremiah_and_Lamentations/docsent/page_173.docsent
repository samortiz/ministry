   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FROM THE WORLD IN ALL ITS ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD'S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Jer 46:1-28; 50 51</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message I would like to give a further word regarding the nations in 46:1 51:64.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>OUR NEED TO KNOW THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>OF THE HISTORICAL EVENTS RECORDED IN JEREMIAH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jeremiah is a book on God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the life-study of this book, my concern is not merely with the historical facts and sequence but with the spiritual significance of the historical events recorded in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To understand the events themselves is one thing, but to see the spiritual significance of these events is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may know the events but not know their spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not read the stories in the Bible or study the Bible in black and white without knowing the spiritual significance of what we are reading or studying.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, my burden regarding chapters forty-six through fifty-one is that we see the spiritual significance of Jehovah's punishment and judgment upon the nations involved with God's elect, Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>EGYPT SIGNIFYING THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OF MAKING A LIVING AND OF ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>AND BABYLON SIGNIFYING THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF REBELLION AGAINST GOD,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IDOL WORSHIP, AND SELF-EXALTATION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The sequence in which Jeremiah covered God's punishment on Israel and His judgment on the nations is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, Jeremiah spoke concerning Israel's sin and Jehovah's punishment on Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then he spoke concerning God's punishment and judgment upon the nations involved with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In speaking concerning the nations, he mentions Egypt first 46:2-28 and Babylon last chs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>50 51 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that, in God's view, the world is first Egyptian and then Babylonian.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, according to historical sequence, Babylon began first, from Babel Gen 10:8-10; 11:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God called Abraham out of Chaldea, the land of Babel, into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But later, when Abraham became weak, he drifted to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Babel is the origin, the source, of man's worship of idols, man's rebellion against God, and human self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After these things began, the world became Egyptian, with Egypt signifying the world in the aspect of making a living and having entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At Babel man rebelled against God, worshipped idols, and exalted man's self, but at Babel there was no way to make a living or to have entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, according to the sequence in Genesis, Babel is mentioned first and then Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During the time of famine, Egypt was nearly the only place that still had food Gen 42:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Egypt was the place of security and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The book of Jeremiah presents us a picture of God's coming in to punish and judge the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to this picture, the last nation to be judged is Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When God judges Babylon, His judgment of the nations will be complete.</S>
