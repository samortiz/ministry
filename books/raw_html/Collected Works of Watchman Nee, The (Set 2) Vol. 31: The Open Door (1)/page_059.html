<h2 class="head2">The Travels of the Co-workers in Hong Kong</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Sister Mei Guang-yao was saved and baptized last Saturday. Praise the Lord! Sisters Yu Su-jen and Rachel Lee hope to go to Yunnan on or around February 10. Brother Chen Ju-yien is still in Hong Kong. If it is completely according to the Lord's will, I plan to go to Chungshan and Macao with Brothers Ju-yien, Wen-yao, and Brothers Mei and Ho. Please remember this in your prayers.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip<br />January 31</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I recently received a letter from Brother Tang Shou-ling written December 12, which I have enclosed. The Lord willing, Mr. Luan will take Brother Chen Ju-yien, Brother Ho Nai-zhao (a responsible brother here), and myself to Macao and Chungshan this afternoon. The work here continues as usual, but it still needs your prayers. Please pray for me individually. Please greet Miss Chang, Miss Wang, and Brother Yu-zhi. Peace.</p><p>Your weak, little brother in the Lord,<br />Stephen Kaung<br />February 8</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Sister Ruth:</p><p>I was very happy when I received your letter. Sister Su-jen and I have decided to go to Yunnan on the tenth of this month by way of Canton. We have the assurance concerning this trip. We will follow the Lord's leading step by step along the way, and we hope that it is not our own move. God kept me in Hong Kong for almost three months and has edified me through all kinds of things. I have benefited greatly. Praise Him! Two brothers and four sisters were baptized last Saturday. There really is work to do in Hong Kong, and the sisters really have a need. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little sister in the Lord,<br />Rachel<br />February 3</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>Greetings to Sister Ruth and Sister Phoebe:</p><p>I really thank God for leading us to come to Hong Kong and for keeping us here for almost three months. We really have benefited much. I deeply feel that any work which does not issue from the Holy Spirit's revelation is dead. Even though something may be spoken, it will not benefit the hearer. Last week Sister Rachel preached the gospel for one week, and some were saved. We will go to Yunnan via Haiphong on February 20. Please pray for us according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. Peace in the Lord. Greet Sister Peace Wang.</p><p>Su-jen<br />February 3</p>
