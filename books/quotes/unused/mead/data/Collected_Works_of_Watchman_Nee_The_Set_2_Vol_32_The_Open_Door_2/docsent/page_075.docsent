   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>An-Hwa, Hunan Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Zhang Gun-jih's family and I arrived in Tung-Ping from Yi-Yang on November 13.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord guided us all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Zhang has been sick for more than two months.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Presently, he is not in critical condition, but he still needs the prayers of all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fever has not left, and there is still much coughing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Yu Yien-chuan, November 26</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan Province</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After spending some time to recuperate, and through your prayer and concern, I can ask now that you turn your prayers into praise, because God has completely healed me, one who has so little faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I came out of the Yi-Yang hospital with God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although my fever was gone and the test on the sputum was negative, I still had many ailments headaches, stuffed nose, bronchitis, etc. when I was in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I weighed only ninety-seven pounds and figured that I would need over half a year for recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But God's thoughts and ways are higher than mine!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In early September Brother Yang Dai came back to Yi-Yang from Ch'ang-sha.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He had a letter from a brother in Tientsin, which spoke of a sudden tragedy in his life that caused him to become very sick.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord enlightened him, and he realized that he had not obeyed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In desperation he called on the Lord and confessed his sins, and God gave him a promise from Proverbs 4:22.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His sickness then left without the assistance of any medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The letter did not affect me much at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But as I was praying one day, I felt that the Lutheran Hospital was not doing my health any good, and that I might have to pass through the suffering of surgery if I went to the Shing-Ya Hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It seemed that the best thing was to ask for God's healing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that moment the promise of that brother entered me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I did not know then that I would receive the healing medicine by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I only knew about God's healing and decided not to remain in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After leaving the hospital, relief was not as steady as it was in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My temperature was the same, but I could get up and walk around a little and do a little work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While faith was just beginning to establish itself, it was tested.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Zhang Gun-jih, who was living in the same house, came down with typhoid fever.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said that when he had a fever earlier, he realized that it was the result of forcing himself to work before he was completely healed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He also said that he learned the lesson that one has to deal with sickness as one deals with sin: the dealing must be thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I was afraid after I heard this, and I prayed that the Lord would show me His will and whether or not leaving the hospital was something I had forced upon myself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the middle of the night, I saw an elderly man with a shining garment walk to my bed and put something white on my right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He put his body over mine and spoke something softly like a prayer and then left.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I cried out loudly and woke up, and I felt a strange scent permeating my being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I felt that this dream matched His promise very well Prov 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The next day I got up and worked as usual.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, I did not have the assurance to travel a long distance or to engage myself in difficult work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Ch'ang-sha was sacked, I retreated with the brothers to Ch'ang-Teh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I had to take a sedan chair.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I arrived in Ch'ang-Teh, the trial became more fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes the cold wind would become very severe, and sometimes I had to walk a long way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the past I would cough even when I put on a lot of clothing and would feel tired even when I walked a few miles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now I do not have to wear a fur coat in snowy weather and do not cough at all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am not tired even when I walk over twenty miles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Faith has been tested, and the fact has proven itself that I am completely healed and recovered to my former health!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He alone is the One who calls things not being as being and who resurrects men from the dead!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He alone has done wonderful things, answering the prayers of all the brothers and sisters!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Recently, I have been resting before the Lord and learning to hear His voice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hebrews 10:5 and 7 have often touched my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since He has prepared a sound body for me, I should walk according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The ministry which He intends for me to receive from Him has been recorded in the Scriptures, the ministry of feeding the lambs and caring for orphans in tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Providentially, I have seen God's provisions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I left the orphanage last year.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since then Brother Kuo Jen-yung has also received a burden for serving the orphans; he has suggested that we embark on this work together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I thought the time was not appropriate, and I suggested that we pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I returned to Ch'ang-Teh, Brother Kuo came from Ch'ang-sha a few days later.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He had thought about going to K'un-ming; instead, he returned to Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He came to Ch'ang-sha on the tenth of the month with the intention of traveling from here to Yunnan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After he left, I felt the meeting in Ch'ang-sha and the work of the orphanage deeply pressing upon my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a result I wrote a letter to him asking whether he had the same leading.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I intend to move into the city and give myself to recovering the meeting and to starting a school for the poor on a small scale gathering less than ten pupils at first .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Presently, I am still waiting to see whether this is His pure and good and acceptable will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Recently, I received a letter from Sister Chang Ai-teh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She did not escape during the great fire.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>During the most dangerous moments, she could only trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There was burning on both sides of the Faith Orphanage, but God protected them with His mighty power.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the fire spread next door, the wind turned and the orphanage was preserved, even though there was fire all around.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many unbelievers came to know our God after the fire, and they acknowledged Him as the real and living One.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although the ones meeting in Yi-Yang have been scattered, Brother Chiu Chung-seng and Sister Tzo Teh-en are still there testifying for the Lord in the surrounding areas.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord is responsible for protecting them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Brother Yang Dai is still residing in the countryside, but he may move back into the city soon.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brother Zhang Gun-jih moved to Dong-Ping in An-Hwa along with the Lutheran High School.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Law and order have gradually returned in Ch'ang-Teh.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I personally witnessed the bombing on the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth of last month.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The devastation is great within the city.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although the area around the meeting hall and the Living Stream Teahouse have all been turned to rubble, these two houses have not suffered any damage.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Not even a piece of glass in the meeting hall was shattered.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A few houses behind the teahouse were bombed, but the bombs did not explode.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God has been gracious to us and has perfected the faith of His children in a wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There are not too many in the meetings, but we still have the Lord's table on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brother Han settled in Chou-Shi-Tzen and will be resting there for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He will travel to north Hunan and work there next spring.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Brothers Shang and Zhu are living with him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Brother Shang said that he has received much light by reading the biography of Madam Guyon, and that he is learning the lesson of not working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Brother Zhu still needs your prayer!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He never fails!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He is glad to grant us the grace!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>May praise and thanksgiving be to Him forever, amen!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Brother Liu Ai-Wu, December 26</S>
