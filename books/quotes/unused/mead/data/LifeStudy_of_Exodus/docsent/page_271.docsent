   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. SEEING THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Seeing the vision of the tabernacle is a matter of tremendous significance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, many readers of Exodus have little interest in chapters twenty-five through forty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They may not be concerned with the materials used in building the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moses received the vision of the tabernacle when he was on the mountaintop under the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God removed the veil, and Moses saw a vision of heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hebrews 8:5 says, Moses was warned when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, He said, that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown you in the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to see this vision, Moses had to make a journey from Egypt to Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. After the Initial Experiences</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to see the vision of the tabernacle, we need to pass through certain initial experiences: the Passover Exo 12 , the crossing of the Red Sea Exo 14 , Marah and Elim Exo 15 , the enjoyment of manna Exo 16 , the enjoyment of the living water out of the cleft rock Exo 17 , and the war against Amalek Exo 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The crossing of the Red Sea signifies baptism, which separates us from Egypt, the world, and delivers us from the tyranny of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The experiences at Marah and Elim point to the dealing of the cross and the fullness of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After we have passed through the experiences of manna, the living water out of the cleft rock, and the war against Amalek, we arrive at Mount Sinai, the mountain of God, where we may receive the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we lack the initial experiences, we shall not be able to see the vision recorded in chapters twenty-five through forty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We praise the Lord that most of us in His recovery have had these initial experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the initial experiences are related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every one of these experiences is an experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But however good these experiences may be, they are still rather elementary.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we come to chapter twenty-five, we have an advance in our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. In Intimate Fellowship with God 1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Receiving the Revelation of What God Is</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After God s people passed through the initial experiences, they entered into intimate fellowship with God at Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During the course of their fellowship with God, they received a revelation of what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This revelation was portrayed by the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The law is a portrait, a photograph, showing what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose you tell me about a brother whom I have not met and then show me a photograph of him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the photograph I get some idea of what this brother is like.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a sense, the brother s picture is a revelation of him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same principle, the law was a revelation of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It revealed that He is holy and righteous and that He is a God of light and love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the Ten Commandments with all the supplementary ordinances give us a clear view of what God is, many Christians do not have this understanding when they read Exodus 20 through 23.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, they pay their attention to the commandments as requirements for them to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Few Christians today realize that the law is a revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The law also exposed the condition of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is holy, but the people were worldly and common.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is righteous, but the people were filled with unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is a God of light and love, but the people were filled with darkness and hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the people were exposed, they urged Moses to go to God on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They realized that because God is holy and righteous, they needed a mediator.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many of us can testify that when we have intimate fellowship with God and receive His revelation, we are exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We sense that we are fallen, sinful, and corrupt and desperately in need of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is good to receive the revelation of what God is and to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the Mountain of God</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moses saw the vision when he was on the mountain of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we would see the vision of the tabernacle, we also need to be on the mountaintop with the Lord.</S>
