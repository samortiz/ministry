   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Cause</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Genesis 4 we see two kinds of examples.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abel was an excellent example of believing the gospel, practicing the gospel, and living for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Cain, the firstborn of the second human generation, was an example of continuing the fall and of turning from God's way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With Adam and Eve there were two main matters: the fall which they caused and the gospel which they received and preached.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Adam and Eve were saved, and they passed on the word of salvation to the following generation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We also must share these things with our own children, telling them the sad story of man's fall and proclaiming to them the good news of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Cain did not follow the way of God's salvation, but continued the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His life was a continuance and a furtherance of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we may say that with Cain mankind experienced a second fall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His parents caused the first fall; he continued it and brought about the second.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here I would speak a word of warning: Never continue the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must separate ourselves from the fall and say to it, "Fall, I refuse to cooperate with you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Stay away from me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I will not allow you to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I will run to God's salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Cain perpetuated man's fall, but Abel pursued God's way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The same choice confronts us today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you want to remain in the fall and continue it or will you go to God for salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not be so unwise as to continue the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must accept God's provision for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, Cain was foolish, remaining in the fall and actually abetting its development.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>a. The Devil's Gain</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to understand the cause of man's second fall.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One reason for Cain's continuing the fall was that the Devil had gained him inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Apparently it was Cain that rejected God's glad tidings; actually it was Satan that kept him from God's way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan knew that if Cain had received the glad tidings he would have had no way to gain him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, he subtly caused Cain to take his own way of worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By this means he kept Cain in his hand and even caused him to fall further.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, the second fall of man was instigated by the subtle one who had gained Cain and worked within him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man's Presumption in Forsaking</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's Way of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the time of Genesis 4 the Devil had already injected himself into man, and God had shown man His way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, Cain was presumptuous in that he forsook God's way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that he followed the Devil and put aside God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was a further cause of the second fall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Cain did not care for God's Word, for God's gospel, and he did not hearken to the preaching of his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once again I say that I strongly believe that his parents preached the gospel to him and his brother, telling them of their need for coverings made from the skins of the sacrificial lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I believe that this accounts for Abel's desire to be a feeder of the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, Cain had no regard for this, presumptuously forsaking God's way and inventing his own.</S>
