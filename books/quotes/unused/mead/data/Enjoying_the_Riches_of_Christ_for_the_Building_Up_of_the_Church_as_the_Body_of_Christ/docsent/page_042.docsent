   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN LIFE, GROWTH, AND TRANSFORMATION FOR THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:6, 17-18; 1:8-9; 4:7-8, 10; 12:9; Rom 8:28-29</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Transformation is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we must realize that transformation is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because there are certain negative factors with us, life alone cannot work out an adequate transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need something further.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians brings us to transformation, but it does not say much about the way to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word transformed is used in 2 Corinthians chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 6 of chapter three says, "Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This confirms that teachings do not work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word letter refers to teachings and doctrines in letter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the teachings and doctrines do a killing work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 17 says, "And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit in verse 17 is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 18 continues: "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In these verses transformation is related to the Spirit who is life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit is the very life, and life is the transforming factor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is this life that transforms us into the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>TRANSFORMATION BY "COOKING"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After chapter three, however, chapter four is necessary because for transformation the Spirit alone is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For good cooking you need water in a cooking vessel, but water alone is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Good cooking requires two opposing elements.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There must be water within and fire without.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need water in the pot, and we need fire under the pot.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Cooking is a kind of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Raw fish does not taste very good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must cook the fish, and by cooking it we transform it from one taste to another taste.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After being cooked, the fish becomes very delicious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It has been transformed by cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Cooking requires water within and fire without.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit is the real water.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all have the "water" within, but we also need the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we only had chapter three of 2 Corinthians we may say, "Transformation is wonderful and marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is by the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And the Lord is the Spirit!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our hymnal we have songs about the Spirit, but we need more songs about "burning," "baking," and "cooking."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to be put into the "oven," and we need to stay there for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the sisters, their dear husband is the best oven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes one oven is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The sisters also need some little ovens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After two or three years of marriage without children, many women are desirous to have a child.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is wonderful, but they must be warned: All the little ones are little "ovens."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 7 of chapter four says, "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are just earthen vessels, but we have a treasure within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, verse 8 continues, "We are pressed on every side."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For the sake of the pressing, we need "helpers" on every side.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I do agree that many young ones among us need to be married, and I would encourage them to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They should not marry too young, but sooner or later the Lord will put them into the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just as a normal family always has an oven, the family itself is an "oven."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not try to escape from the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To prepare to get married is to get ready to be put into the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I never speak flowery words about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To speak in this way is to cheat you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In a sense marriage is wonderful, but in another sense it is awful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who are married have experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A wife is a good oven and also a good dessert.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you are going to enjoy the dessert, you must be prepared to suffer the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even in the church life there are some "ovens."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we have seen, by pray-reading and by the life-giving Spirit we all are one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, the oven is still among us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes the brothers are the oven to the sisters, and sometimes the sisters are an oven to the brothers.</S>
