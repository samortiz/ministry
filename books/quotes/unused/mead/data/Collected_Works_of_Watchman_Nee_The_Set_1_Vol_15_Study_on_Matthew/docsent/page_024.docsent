   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER EIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 1: "And when He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse should immediately follow the end of chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 2: "And behold, a leper, coming near, worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From the other Gospels, we can see that this leper was healed before the giving of the teachings on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In contrast to the Gospel of Mark, the Gospel of Matthew was not written absolutely according to historical order.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each writer of the Gospels has his own characteristic in arranging the order of the events.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matthew records the Lord's acts and words, whereas Mark records mostly the Lord's acts and very little of the Lord's words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is because Mark shows the Lord as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A slave should not speak too much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Mark especially uses the word "immediately," whereas Matthew especially uses the term "the kingdom of the heavens" thirty-three times.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the word "immediately" is often used in Mark, everything recorded in the book is according to historical order.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, of the four Gospels, the Gospel of Mark has the most accurate chronology of historical events.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regarding the chronological order, Mark is more accurate than Luke, and John is more accurate than Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The words used quite often by John are "the next day" or "the second day."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the chronological order in John is more accurate than that in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew, Mark, and Luke are concerned in particular with the events that occurred while the Lord was in Judea; John writes specifically about the events that occurred while the Lord was in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, this is not absolutely so.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The order in Luke is according to morality, while the order in Matthew is according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The miracles in Mark are recorded approximately according to chronological order, as can be seen in the incident of crossing the sea in Mark 4:35-41.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The order of the events recorded in Matthew 8 as edited by him is as follows: 1 the cleansing of the leper, 2 the healing of the centurion's servant, and 3 the healing of Peter's mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, according to chronological order, they should be as follows: 1 the healing of Peter's mother-in-law, 2 the cleansing of the leper, and 3 the healing of the centurion's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Why did Matthew record these events in such a way?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the Gospel of Matthew, from the beginning to the end, intends to show people the strictness of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Matthew's record uses the kingdom of the heavens as the backbone, as the center, and speaks continuously along the same line.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, he puts the facts together without caring for the historical order.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Luke is written with morality as its goal, which is to speak forth how God grants mercy to men.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, in Luke we can see God's salvation in every section.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John speaks of the Lord's preaching in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Galilee is sometimes called "Galilee of the Gentiles."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, John writes with the world as the criterion and eliminates all the background.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why should "behold" be inserted at the beginning of verse 2?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is to get people's attention because what follows is a special case.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For instance, even Elisha dared not to see Naaman or to get near him, but ordered him to wash himself 2 Kings 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Old Testament there are the ordinances of how the lepers can be cleansed Lev 14 , but here we have the healing of the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, verse 2 begins with " behold."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to history, the order of the events in this chapter is as follows: 1 the healing of Peter's mother-in-law, 2 the cleansing of the leper, and 3 the healing of the centurion's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These events are recorded in a different way because they are types.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There were many lepers, but only one was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Jews were like lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They all committed sin, but among the Jews, only a small remnant received grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The servant of the centurion was a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because Israel would not receive grace, salvation went to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Luke it was recorded that the centurion sent some elders of the Jews to entreat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is to show that salvation was of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Matthew was written to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, in order to show that the Gentiles can come to the Lord directly, Matthew did not mention the elders of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The leper was healed by being touched by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This shows that the Jews were related in the flesh to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The servant of the centurion was healed, but the Lord did not touch him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, He spoke a word from a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The centurion heard it and believed, but the servant did not see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This shows that the Gentiles are saved through believing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What the Lord has ordained for us today is that we believe without seeing John 20:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Leprosy signifies the filthiness of sin and refers to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paralysis signifies the impotence of sin and refers to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Fever signifies the energy of the flesh in disobeying God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sin causes man not only to be filthy but also to be impotent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Filthiness is something before God and needs to be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Weakness needs power.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Peter's mother-in-law was healed because Peter had an intimate relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This shows us that after the Gentiles have received salvation, the Lord again will be gracious to Israel for the sake of Abraham and David.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Fever refers to the situation of the tribulation, since tribulation is like a furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Matthew recorded these events in such a way to emphasize the doctrinal aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 17 refers in particular to the millennium, because in the kingdom the power of death ceases to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although death will be there, it is for the punishment of sin, because those who will be born during the millennium may not all be saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Their death will be due to God's punishment.</S>
