<p>The twelve gates are twelve pearls (Rev. 21:21a), signifying that the entrance is the produce of Christ in His redemptive and secreting work. We have seen that the produce of Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death and all-inclusive resurrection are the pearls. The produce of such a Christ becomes the very communication of the city, and this communication constitutes an entrance and fellowship that we may enjoy all the riches of the Triune God in every way. This is our marvelous portion even today. Today we are the pearls and we are the gates. Praise the Lord for the triune gates and the triune entrance, which are the communication of God&rsquo;s administrative business.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NAMES OF THE TWELVE TRIBES</h2>
<p>Also, the twelve gates are inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel (Rev. 21:12) who were the representatives of the law of the Old Testament, signifying the requirement of the law at the entrance into the kingdom of God. The gates bear the names of the twelve tribes. Because the twelve tribes in the Old Testament were for God&rsquo;s administration, this indicates that the twelve gates are for God&rsquo;s administration. Also, the twelve tribes are representatives of the Old Testament law. Therefore, the names of the twelve tribes inscribed on the twelve gates indicate that the law is watching over the twelve gates. With the law there is nothing that supplies or nourishes. The law only requires something of us. The law is watching over the gates. If a sinner is to come into the holy city, the requirement of the law must be fulfilled. The law is the gate watcher or the guard at the gate to insure that you have fulfilled its requirement. As you are &ldquo;walking through the gate&rdquo; and you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the law says that you are okay. As long as you are in Jesus Christ, every part of the requirement of the law is fulfilled and you are okay. You can now get into the holy city.</p>
<p>Without such a picture, I do not think that any of us would imagine that when we called on the name of the Lord Jesus the law was watching over us. This picture shows us, though, that we entered through the gates with the names of the representatives of the law inscribed on them. This means that when we entered into the gate, the law was satisfied since the requirement of the law had been fully fulfilled. When we came to the triune entrance we had a &ldquo;free ticket&rdquo; because Christ paid the price for us, and the guard at the gate (the law) honors Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW&mdash;A CHILD-CONDUCTOR</h2>
<p>In addition, we must realize that the law is not only a watcher at the gate but also the child-conductor of the entry (Gal 3:24). The law is not only at the gate, but the law also brings all God&rsquo;s chosen people to the gate. If the law could speak to a chosen one it would say, &ldquo;I will bring you to the gate and I will meet you there.&rdquo; The law was not given for us to keep, but the law was given to conduct us to Christ. The law is the conductor to bring you to the gate, and the law is also the guard to &ldquo;okay&rdquo; your entry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWELVE ANGELS</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we see twelve angels at the twelve gates (Rev. 21:12), signifying that the angels watch over the entry into the New Jerusalem (Luke 15:7, 10; Heb. 1:14). Each gate not only bears one of the names of the twelve tribes, but also has an angel. The law requires and the angel watches. The angels are spectators. The entire realm of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is actually &ldquo;a big show.&rdquo; To enter into this show you need a free ticket and in this show there are spectators. These spectators are the angels. If you do not confess the name of Christ, you cannot get a free ticket. However, if you call on the name of the Lord Jesus you get a free ticket into the holy city and the angelic spectators will rejoice and welcome you in. One angel at the gate actually represents the entire angelic realm. In Luke 15:10 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.&rdquo; When we believed in the Lord Jesus, when we repented and called on His precious name, we probably did not realize that there was a myriad of angels in heaven &ldquo;clapping their hands&rdquo; and rejoicing.</p>
<p>It was not a small thing for us to enter into the realm of God&rsquo;s interest on this earth. The Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the twelve tribes, the law, and all the angels were involved in our entrance into the kingdom of God. Our entrance began from eternity past since God exercised His foreknowledge to choose us. Without such a picture, none of us would realize that our entering into God&rsquo;s interest involved so much. Our entering into the New Jerusalem involved God the Father in eternity, God the Son coming to die on the cross for us to accomplish redemption, and also God the Spirit reaching us and searching within us in order to sanctify us and bring us unto the obedience of Christ. Our entrance into the holy city furthermore involved the law and the entire angelic realm. If we have this view, our realization of our all-inclusive salvation will be strengthened. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are in this salvation, the law works for this salvation, and the angels are expecting something to happen in this salvation.</p>
<p>The Triune God, the twelve tribes, the law, and all the angels were working together for our entering into the New Jerusalem. We all have to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord&rdquo; for our all-inclusive salvation. We may not have rejoiced that much when we were saved because we did not see the vision concerning all that the Triune God went through to be our entrance. We all need to celebrate our birth in Christ. According to the vision the Lord has shown us in this chapter, I would say, &ldquo;Happy birthday to you.&rdquo; Rejoice in the salvation of God which involves the Triune God, the twelve tribes, the law, and all the angels.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_114.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_116.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's New Testament Economy &nbsp; pg 115</div><br></body></html>
