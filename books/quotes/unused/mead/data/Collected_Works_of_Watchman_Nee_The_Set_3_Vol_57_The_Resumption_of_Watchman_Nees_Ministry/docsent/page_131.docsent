   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH AND THE WORK,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE MEANING AND AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE CHURCH, AND</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IDENTIFICATION WITH THE CHURCH Co-workers' Meeting Date: May 15, 1948, Saturday, 7:30 p.m.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Speaker: Watchman Nee THE RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE WORK The Church Being Local</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and the Work Being Regional</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sphere of the church is a locality, and the sphere of the work is a region.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A church is local.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That is why we have the church in Ephesus, the church in Colossae, and the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the work is more than local.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The book of Acts shows us that the first group of workers went from Jerusalem to Samaria, and then to all the other places.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These workers were not limited to the locality of Jerusalem, but they were limited to the region of Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, this shows us that their work was regional.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At Antioch there was a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There we see Paul and Barnabas going out to start the work among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Gentile world there were the churches in Galatia and the churches in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These churches form one region.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, in the Bible there is not only the company of Peter preaching the gospel; there is also the company of Barnabas preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Philippians even speaks of another group of people 1:15-17 working in a different region.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul said that the measure apportioned to him allowed him to reach even as far as the Corinthians 2 Cor 10:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, Paul had his region of work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Work Being Divided into Regions,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>but the Fellowship Being One</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are regions to the work, and each region includes certain localities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Under normal circumstances, though the regions are different, there is still a oneness between the regions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the relationship is normal, all the works in the different regions maintain the one fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jerusalem is one with Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although they belong to different regions, they still have fellowship before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When people were saved in Antioch, Jerusalem sent some men over to help Acts 11:20-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jerusalem also sent out Barnabas and Paul 9:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Antioch was something that came out of Jerusalem and returned back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Jerusalem was short of money, Antioch sent money from the Gentiles to Jerusalem 11:27-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Barnabas went from Jerusalem to Antioch v. 22 , and Paul returned from Antioch to Jerusalem 15:2 . Here we see that although regions are different, the fellowship remains one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Elders Being Responsible for the Church,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>and the Apostles Being Responsible for the Work</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The elders are responsible for the church in a locality Titus 1:5 , whereas the apostles are responsible for the work in a region.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter and his co-workers were in charge of the work in Judea, whereas Paul and his co-workers were in charge of Antioch and the work in the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The apostles worked within the regions assigned to them by God 2 Cor 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How to Handle Finances</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How should we handle the church finances?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the money that the brothers and sisters designate for a local church should be placed in the church offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever is designated for the poor brothers should be marked clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whatever is designated for individuals or for the work in another region should likewise be clearly marked.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You can separate the offerings for local use and for the work by using two offering boxes, or the two can go into the same offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church has full liberty to distribute these offerings in whatever way it chooses, and individuals have full liberty to give according to their faith.</S>
