   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EMOTIONAL ATHEISTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the emotion?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the part of man's psychological makeup which controls his wants, likes, and dislikes, his preferences and aversions, and his pleasures and displeasures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people do not want God; they dislike God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since they prefer not to have God, they say that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let me relate a story.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is a bird called the ostrich.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It has a big body, and it is tall.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A man can even ride on it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But it is very dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to catch it, a few dozen men will surround it and chase it around until it becomes tired.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ostrich has a big body, but its head is very small.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When it sees many people chasing it and men all around, it will dig a small hole in the ground with its feet and bury its small head in the hole.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ostrich thinks that it will be safe if it does not see anyone anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It does not realize that even though its head is in the hole, the men are still present.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Its big body is still exposed and not hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are some people who wish that there were no God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They wish that there were no such thing as God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Can their wish mean anything?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Does God not exist just because they wish to have no God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once I was preaching the gospel in one place, and a very evil person purposely came and said to me, "Do not say anything to me about Jesus, the Bible, or the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You do not have to speak about these things, because a basic problem has not been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How can you talk about the gospel when the most crucial question of whether or not there is a God is not settled?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I then asked him, "Friend, do you not believe that there is a God?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said, "I have told you already that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What makes you say that God exists?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please explain it to me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I said, "Of course, you do not believe that there is a God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He asked, "Why do you insist that there is a God when I say that there is no God?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I said, "You know the answer yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He seemed bewildered and said, "How do I know?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I said, "You know within."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was a little frustrated and said, "What does it mean that I know within?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I said, "You wish that there was no God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no need for me to say anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You know within."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He seemed to understand a little and walked away embarrassed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no need to say anything to these ones or argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, they cannot be considered atheists; they are only trying to reject God in their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE "VERBAL" ATHEISTS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These people do not argue from reason; they merely assert with their mouth that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are very stubborn, and there is no way to argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you ask why they do not believe in God, they cannot give you any reason.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They merely tell you that they do not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You can give them a hundred reasons why there is a God, and they will come back a hundred and one times to tell you that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even if you can give a thousand reasons, they will oppose you with a thousand and one reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You can do nothing about these people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are merely being stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They will not change what they have said.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if you argue with them for three days and three nights, and even if they know they are wrong, they will still insist and argue with you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although they may give many reasons, their reasons are all prejudiced and presumptuous.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are very insistent about what they say, and no one can do anything about them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Their minds are empty and void of reason.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet their mouths are full of atheistic jargon.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why I call them "verbal" atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is impossible to reason with the above three groups of people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But there is another group of atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is more hope for this group, yet its number is very small.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What kind of atheists are these?</S>
