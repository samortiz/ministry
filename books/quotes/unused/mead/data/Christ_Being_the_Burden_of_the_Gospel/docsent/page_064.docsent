   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE THE FLOWING OUT OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 3:4; Gal 4:19; 2 Cor 4:7-11; Gal 2:20 THREE LAWS IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we saw the law of the Spirit of life as a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will fellowship about the practical application of this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every person is of three parts spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When man was created, the element of his human life was good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the law of good is in man s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When man was tempted and fell, the element of the life of Satan, the devil, entered his body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consequently, the law of sin and of death, which opposes God, is in man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, when a man is saved, God s life enters into him; hence, the law of the Spirit of life is in a believer s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This law is higher than the law of good and the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THREE KINDS OF LIFE IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In man s soul there is the human life, in man s body there is the devil s life, and in man s spirit there is God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Adam was created, he had only the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the fall man s situation became complicated because the life of the devil came into his body, which is opposed to the law of good in man s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chinese philosophers speak of this opposition as a war between reasoning and lust.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Humans with a weak will commit the most sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In contrast, those with a strong will are more successful in temporarily denying the lusts in the flesh, but they can never fully overcome the lusts of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the reason that ancient Chinese sages spoke of the need to cultivate an overcoming ability.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A person who is not saved is quite complicated because he has two lives the life of man and the life of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After he is saved, he receives yet another life the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When man was created, he obtained the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the fall the life of the devil was added, but with salvation man received the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every believer is like a miniature of the garden of Eden, having the created human life, the life represented by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and the life represented by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A saved person has three kinds of life, and every life has a law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A law is a natural power that cannot be changed merely because one has a will to change it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The law of good is in our soul, the law of sin and of death is in our flesh, and the law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>None of these laws can be changed by an act of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The nature of the law of good is to do good, and the nature of the law of sin and of death is to do evil Rom 7:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person strives to do good in his soul, but he cannot refrain from doing evil in his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a person grows, his flesh grows and the expression of evil grows.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is altogether beyond the control of his will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though an unsaved person may be able to do good temporarily, he will do evil in the end.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In addition to the law of good and the law of sin and of death, however, believers have the law of the Spirit of life 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This law of life goes beyond good and evil and is above the law of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only this law is able to deliver us out of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Confucius s teaching related to the bright virtue is an attempt to cultivate the law of good in man s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, Christ s salvation involves much more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CHRIST S SALVATION BEING TO EXPRESS GOD</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>BY THE LAW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The center of Christ s salvation is God Himself, and the purpose of salvation is to express God, not to express good.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ s salvation is not related to living by the law of good to express morality; Christ s salvation is related to living by the law of the Spirit of life to express God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the cross of Christ deals with both our fallen soul and our lustful body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the salvation of God the passions and lusts of the body must be crucified, and our soul, our self, must be denied Gal 5:24; Matt 16:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the lusts of our body are not crucified and our soul is not denied, the life within our spirit cannot be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE SOUL AND THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>NEEDING TO BE DEALT WITH IN ORDER FOR</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE LIFE OF GOD TO FLOW OUT</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order for God s life to flow out, the soul and the body must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The soul must be denied because the human life is incapable of accomplishing the good that it desires to do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without the life of God there is no way for man to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, the good that comes out of the life of God is far above the good that is related to the life of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to the Bible, there are three different kinds of good or goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first kind of good is related to the good that is reflected in the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God regarded His work of creating man as being very good, and this good was expressed through the goodness of man s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The second kind of good is related to the good that is a part of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that is, the good that can be distinguished from evil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The third kind of good is related to the good that is God Himself Mark 10:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the good that God wants us to express.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Of these three kinds of good, only the good of God is the true good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is not even possible to work out the other two kinds of good without God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The good of God can be worked out only by the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever life flows out, the good of God is lived out.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, the good in God can flow out only when Christians are subject to the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Before a man is saved, he may not treat his wife well.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But after he is saved, he will make up his mind to treat his wife well.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His determination is related to his will to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If he could succeed in this determination, he would fulfill the law of good through his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if salvation could be obtained through the fulfillment of good by the soul, there would be no need for the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our need for the law of the Spirit of life proves that our will to do good cannot succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The good desires of the soul can never be accomplished by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Consequently, God has no desire for us to focus on cultivating our soul; instead, He wants us to deny the soul because it hinders the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If a man makes up his mind to treat his wife well, his efforts will end only in failure.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In contrast, the law of the Spirit of life is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It goes far beyond the good things related to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The purpose of the law of the Spirit of life is not for us to do good or even for us to avoid evil; it is for us to express God by letting His life flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only in this expression is there a true overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>GOD DEALING WITH EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>THAT HINDERS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Christians should let God s life flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The first step of salvation involves the cross dealing with all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The second step involves the cross dealing with our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Salvation is related to Christ living out of us by flowing out of us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If a person is governed by his emotions, God will deal with his emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If a person is controlled by his strong will, God will deal with his will.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If a person lives by his complicated mind, God will deal with his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God will deal with everything that hinders the flowing of the divine life so that His life can be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The real hindrance to the flowing out of God s life is not sin or evil but the goodness in man s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The real hindrance to the flowing out of God s life is not a hot temper or pride but the meekness and humility of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God must deal with the goodness that comes out of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If a person s self hinders God s life from flowing out, God s hand will surely come upon him.</S>
