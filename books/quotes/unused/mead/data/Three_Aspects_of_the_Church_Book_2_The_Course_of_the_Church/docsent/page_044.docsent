   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH 2 THE RECOVERY AMONG THE BRETHREN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the nineteenth century the brothers of the so-called Brethren assemblies were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was one of God s great recoveries in the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This recovery was exceedingly strong and very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The following items were recovered through the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Absolutely Forsaking the World</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is rare in church history to see a group break its ties with the world as cleanly as the Brethren did.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were much more advanced than the Moravian Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Moravian Brethren broke their ties with politics and religious organization; the Brethren not only forsook politics and religious organization but also the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They did this in an absolutely clean way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even today there are some among the Brethren who have never had their picture taken so that they will not leave any pictures behind for people to see.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, it is difficult to find a proper biography of John Nelson Darby because he did not allow people to write his biography or publicize what he did.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of the Brethren were titled nobility, but they wrote respectful letters to the English monarch renouncing their titles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The pitiful situation today is that some who do not have a doctorate still seek to have a degree.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of today s preachers have never attended a university, yet they advertise themselves as Dr. So-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Brethren rejected all such worldly things; they were freed from them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In all of church history they were the most thorough in forsaking the world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was not merely a form; they were not only separated from the world but actually forsook it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brotherly Love</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Next, the Brethren recovered the reality of brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we were to compare our situation today with their situation one hundred years ago, we would be far behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They had the reality of the brotherly love in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Practical Living</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, probably no other group of Christians in church history has matched the Brethren in the matter of practical living before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The practical living of the Brethren included their families.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some have said that the best Christian families in the whole world were those of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This recovery of practical Christian living was high, great, and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Truth</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another particular recovery among the Brethren was the recovery of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most Christians acknowledge that the recovery of truth and revelation among the Brethren surpassed everything before it; Darby is considered the king of Bible exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The proper truths taught in Protestantism today are nearly one hundred percent from the truths recovered by the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although their knowledge of a few truths concerning overcoming was incomplete, their knowledge of most truths was very proper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the orthodox things taught in Protestantism today have been influenced by the teachings of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moody said that if all the books in the entire world were burned, he would be satisfied to have a copy of the Bible and a copy of Notes on the Pentateuch by the Brethren writer C. H. Mackintosh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Scofield Reference Bible is popular among Christians today; it is a reference Bible that many preachers cannot do without.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christians are also familiar with Scofield s Bible correspondence course.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nearly ninety percent of what Scofield wrote in these two publications was adopted from Brethren teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, Scofield was not an original writer; he passed on material taught by the Brethren, which he collected and edited.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many basic truths concerning things such as the church, the Lord s return, prophecies, and the separation between the church and the world were recovered at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The recovery of these things was bright and clear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Luther recovered the truth of justification by faith, but he did not expound it clearly enough; the Brethren thoroughly expounded the truth of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>J. N. Darby, one of the Brethren, wrote #47 in Hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is difficult to find a similar hymn of such quality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first two stanzas say, Father, Thy name our souls would bless, / As children taught by grace, / Lift up our hearts in righteousness, / And joy before Thy face.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>/ Sweet is the confidence Thou giv st, / Though high above our praise; / Our hearts resort to where Thou liv st / In heaven s unclouded rays.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The truth in this hymn is truly high, deep, and penetrating.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must note here that when Brother Watchman Nee translated this hymn into Chinese, he improved upon the original English.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although the hymn was already very good, it was not so clear in its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After passing through Brother Nee s translation, it is clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Darby also wrote #127 in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first stanza says, Hark! ten thousand voices crying, / Lamb of God! with one accord; / Thousand thousand saints replying, / Wake at once the echo ng chord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This hymn is excellent; it is difficult to find another person who could write a hymn in which the truth is so clear and accurate, the meaning so profound and great, and the quality so substantial and outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This was a great recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, the Brethren also expounded the meaning of justification and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before the Brethren were raised up, many people thought they were clear in their knowledge of the truth, but they were actually confused.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only after the Brethren were raised up was the truth clearly defined.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>More than ninety-five percent of the work to cut straight of the word of the truth 2 Tim 2:15 was accomplished by the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must give them credit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although people may condemn them today, we still must mention their strong points.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The value of the Brethren will not be measured until eternity; only then will we be able to express what practical benefit they were to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our intention is not to praise the Brethren but to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Luther brought the Bible out of the Roman Catholic Church and made it public, but he did not expound it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible was not expounded until the time of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In their hands the truth was recovered in a great and strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To this day Darby s five-volume Synopsis of the Books of the Bible has not been excelled.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The thought in the Synopsis is deep; Darby s view is broad, and his knowledge of the Bible is something few have attained.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A believer, earnestly pursuing the truth, would still have to study this work for ten years in order to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This set of books has a value and position to which other books cannot compare, so it is no wonder that people honor Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If someone reads and understands the Synopsis of the Books of the Bible, he will see that in Darby s hands, the Bible is very clear from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Darby was not perfect; it is not possible for any man to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, the Synopsis is something from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Darby was fluent in five languages English, French, German, Greek, and Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His Greek and Hebrew were excellent, enabling him to translate the Bible into English, French, and German.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I have heard that the French and German versions are his best translations.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In addition to translating the Bible into English, French, and German, Darby also wrote many books.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is difficult to say how he found the time to produce so many precious books.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It would be very difficult for an ordinary person, who lived to the age of eighty, to write so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Brother Nee said that if Darby had not become a servant of the Lord, he would have been famous in the world because he had a great soul.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The truths he recovered are excellent, with a proper view and much light.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We thank God for these truths because we have received much help from them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I believe that all those living before God today with a proper knowledge of the Bible have been helped by the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Even those who oppose the Brethren have received help from them.</S>
