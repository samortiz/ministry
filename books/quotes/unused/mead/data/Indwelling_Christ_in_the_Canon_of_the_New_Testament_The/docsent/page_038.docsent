   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECEIVING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit was promised, the Spirit is now being ministered, and the Spirit must be received.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Gal 3:2 , The Spirit is ministered to us, and we must learn to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can we receive?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First of all we must open ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not keep ourselves closed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are in a meeting listening to some kind of ministry, we must say, Lord, keep me open to You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I want to receive the ministry of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Forty years ago I used to sit and listen to Brother Watchman Nee quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I did not look to the Lord to keep me open, I might hear the message, yet I would not get much of the Lord inside me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So we must all keep ourselves open to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While we are listening and opening ourselves to the Lord, we must continually say Amen in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the way to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must open ourselves and say Amen to His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we open ourselves and say Amen to the Word, the Word which is outside of us gets into our spirit and becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then when we express something of the Spirit to others, it becomes the Word again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they will amen the Word, it will get into them and become the Spirit again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the way to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BEGINNING AND WALKING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After receiving the Spirit, we must begin in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gal 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all must begin in the Spirit and continue in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we begin in the Spirit, it means that we are starting to walk in the spirit, we are beginning to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, after beginning in the Spirit, we must learn to walk in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit lit., in spirit , and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh Gal 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word walk in Greek means to have our being in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever we say, whatever we do, whatever we are, and wherever we are, are all included in this one word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So to walk in spirit means to have our being in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that all the time we must live by Christ and take Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>SOW TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this short book, there are so many items about the subjective Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After walking in spirit, we must learn to sow to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we shall reap of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life eternal Gal 6:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This simply means that whatever we intend to do must be one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To sow to the Spirit means to have Christ as the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we will reap a harvest of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ first of all is the seed to us, and eventually He becomes our very harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not the doctrinal Christ, but the Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is our seed, and He is our harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are daily sowing the Spirit as the seed, surely some day we will reap something of the Spirit as our harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we sow to the flesh, we will reap a harvest of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore whatever we do must be the seed of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then, spontaneously, something will grow up out of what we have sown.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the indwelling Christ experienced as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE GRACE IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By reading the book of Galatians properly, we see clearly that the proper Christian life is nothing but a daily walk in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And today this Christ is the very Spirit within us for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So this book begins with deliverance from this present evil age, and it ends with this: Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Amen Gal 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Are we living in this present evil age, or are we living in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Are we living in religion, or are we walking in spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To walk in spirit means to walk in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is in our spirit that we have the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is why this verse says that the Lord s grace is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we get into our spirit, we enjoy the Lord as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we begin to quarrel with our wife or husband, we must run back to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The more we stay in our mind, the more we will exchange words.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But when we get into our spirit, we touch the grace of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Grace is the Lord experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The experienced Christ becomes our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here we could never exchange words, because we are in another country.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The mind is a quarreling country, but the spirit is a country of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not a matter of trying to overcome, it is a matter of being in the right country.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The right country is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Paul begins the book of Galatians by speaking about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then he changes to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Eventually, he tells us that the Spirit, who is the reality of Christ, is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, we must learn to stay in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order to do this we need some exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By our natural birth and life, we live not in our spirit, but in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But now we must change countries.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must learn continually to return to the country of grace which is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Very few Christians today know that Christ is in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hardly anyone has ever paid any attention to the last verse of Galatians: Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Satan is so subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whenever anyone comes to this verse, he covers the last three words, with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The satanic hand hid these three words from me for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I expounded this book verse by verse to others, but I never expounded the last three words.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But the whole book of Galatians is contained in these three words.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We can have all the electrical wires installed into a building, yet if we don t have a switch, we cannot apply the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the satanic deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>These three words are the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Without them, how and where shall we touch Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Oh, how evil Satan is!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He has hidden the switch from God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But today we know where the switch is.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Christ is the very God in process, and eventually the processed God is Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In our spirit we enjoy the indwelling Christ as our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is with our spirit !</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What is the grace?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Grace is simply Christ Himself as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When we come back to our spirit, there is just the sweet enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When we turn to our spirit, we simply enjoy Him as our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we are living in our mind, we are living in a backward country.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should not stay there, but turn to the wonderful country of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This country is not backward, but full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Here we have Christ as our full enjoyment.</S>
