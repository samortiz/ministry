<h1 class="title">THE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY FOR<br />
THE SUBJECTIVE SALVATION OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10, 17; 8:2-3, 6, 9-11, 14-16, 29-30</h1>
<p>In some recent messages we pointed out that the book of Ephesians is structured with the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Now we need to go on to see this divine dispensing in other books of the New Testament. In this message we shall begin to consider the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in Romans. Although we have given many messages on Romans, in the past we did not emphasize the matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. As we shall see, this matter is revealed in a full and rich way in chapter eight of Romans.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A REVELATION OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>In chapter one of this book Paul indicates that Romans is concerned with the gospel of God. In 1:1 Paul says that he was &ldquo;separated to the gospel of God,&rdquo; and in 1:16 he says that he is not ashamed of the gospel. The entire book of Romans unfolds the gospel of God in a full way.</p>
<p>In this Epistle we have a revelation of God&rsquo;s salvation from both the objective side and the subjective side. On the objective side, we have redemption, forgiveness of sins, justification, and reconciliation. On the subjective side, we have regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. All the aspects of the subjective side of God&rsquo;s salvation are related to the divine life. We have been regenerated with the divine life, and now we are being sanctified with this life. Simultaneously, we are being transformed with the divine life, and by it we shall eventually be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. Eventually, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, we shall be glorified. We shall be glorified not only with divine power, but also with the divine life.</p>
<p>On the subjective side of God&rsquo;s full salvation the matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is strongly implied. When some hear this, they may point out that the word &ldquo;dispensing&rdquo; is not used anywhere in the book of Romans. This is correct. But the fact of the divine dispensing is found in this Epistle nonetheless. This fact is indicated by the word &ldquo;give&rdquo; in 8:11: &ldquo;But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you.&rdquo; This verse says that the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead gives life to our mortal bodies. The giving of life is actually the dispensing of the divine life into our being. Therefore, it is right to say that the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is found in the book of Romans.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Objective Side</h2>
<p>The first four and a half chapters of Romans cover the salvation of God from the objective side. Through God&rsquo;s salvation we are justified and reconciled to God. Then beginning from 5:12 and continuing through chapter eight, the book of Romans covers the subjective side of God&rsquo;s salvation. In these chapters we see that we who were once in Adam have been transferred out of Adam into Christ by believing in the Lord Jesus. Therefore, in 6:3 Paul says that we have been &ldquo;baptized into Christ Jesus.&rdquo; We were born into Adam, but we have been baptized into Christ. Now in Christ we enjoy the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Subjective Side</h2>
<p>Romans 5:10 says, &ldquo;For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.&rdquo; In this verse we see both sides of God&rsquo;s salvation, the objective side and the subjective side. Through the death of Christ we have been reconciled to God. This is objective and has already been accomplished. Now that we have been reconciled to God, we shall be saved in Christ&rsquo;s life and by this life. This is the subjective side of God&rsquo;s salvation. Although reconciliation through the death of Christ has been accomplished once for all, to be saved in His life from many negative things is still a daily matter, and it will take place throughout our entire Christian life. Day by day we are being saved by His life. Do you know where this life is? This life is within us.</p>
<p>In 5:17 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Life is not only able to save us; it is also able to make us kings reigning over all negative things. For example, in life we can reign over sins, the flesh, the self, and the natural life. We have the power to reign over every negative thing, that is, over everything that is not a positive testimony to God. Hallelujah, we have both the saving life and the reigning life! The life of Christ is this saving and reigning life. As we read Romans 5:10 and 17, we need to pay careful attention to two important phrases: &ldquo;saved in His life&rdquo; (v. 10) and &ldquo;reign in life&rdquo; (v. 17). I would even suggest that you underline these phrases in your Bible.</p>
<p>As we go on from chapters five and six to chapters seven and eight, we are brought on from doctrine to experience. We may not like Romans 7, but this chapter is a bridge joining chapters six and eight. Without the bridge of Romans 7, we shall not have the way into chapter eight.</p>
