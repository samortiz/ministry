   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOTES FROM MESSAGE SEVEN PRACTICING TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: Col 3:16; John 6:63b; Eph 6:17; 1 Cor 2:13 THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A LIFE OF SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WORD OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not easy to speak the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is because we do not have this concept or practice in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To speak the word of the Lord is to speak forth something concerning God s mystery, God s will, something concerning His riches and His truth, and especially something concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is rather easy for us to speak ordinary words, but to speak spiritual words, words that speak of Christ and speak forth Christ, requires special practice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The title of this message is Practicing to Speak the Word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To speak the Lord s word does not mean that you recite the words of the Bible verse by verse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Neither does it mean that you quote some Scriptures to support what you are speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, it means that when you have some experience of the Lord and some understanding of God, you relate to others your experience and understanding by biblical words and spiritual expressions 1 Cor 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you speak, you should not speak as if you are writing a formal composition; rather, you should speak in an ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of speaking is not easy, but this kind of speaking is the speaking by the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A proper Christian life that is up to standard is a life of speaking the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, if we have been a Christian for many years, but we still cannot speak the Lord s word today, we are not proper and are not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After many years of observation, I have found this to be a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are many kinds of Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, there are the pastors, evangelists, and preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To put it in a simple way, preaching is their profession.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most of them can go up to the platform and give a sermon, but many of them cannot speak the Lord s word in their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is like some Chinese scholars in the old days.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They might have ranked first in the national examinations, but it is possible that they could not write a letter home.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When asked to compose a classical writing, these scholars could easily do that; but when they were asked to write a letter home, many of them could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today many preachers and pastors can preach on the platform, but when they talk with people in their daily life, they cannot speak the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The main reason is that they are short of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They lack the understanding of God and the experience of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Another reason for this inability is the lack of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How much a man can speak for the Lord depends on how much experience he has.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But even if he has the experience, if there is no prayer, his experience cannot be converted into speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is by prayer that his experience is converted into words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But even if a man has the experience and also has prayed, still he needs to digest the Lord s word and have the word of the Lord constituted into him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only then can he speak the word of the Lord in his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BY PRAYING AND READING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse seven of Hymns, #811 says:</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Feeding and drinking, Lord Jesus, of Thee,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Feeding by reading, and drinking by prayer;</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Reading and praying, I eat and I drink,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praying and reading Lord, Thou art my fare.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The third line of this verse speaks of reading and praying, and the fourth line speaks of praying and reading.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To pray-read is to eat the Lord, and to read-pray is to drink the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In pray-reading the emphasis is on reading, and this reading is an eating.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In read-praying the emphasis is on praying, and this praying is a drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Bible spiritual breathing is linked to spiritual drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the air there is water.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Air would be harmful to us if it did not have water in it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In one sense, when a man breathes in air, he is drinking in water.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible likens prayer to breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since breathing also includes drinking, prayer is also a kind of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not my experience alone; sister M. E. Barber in one of her hymns also said, Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed verse 2 of Hymns, #73 . Her experience also confirms that to breathe is to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you want to digest the word of the Lord, you need to pray-read; that is, you must first read and then pray.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To pray-read is to turn what you read into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then you also need to read-pray, which is to mingle the Lord s word in your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To pray-read is to eat; to read-pray is to drink.</S>
