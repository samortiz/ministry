<h1 class="title">SAVED BY GRACE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Eph. 2:8-9</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The meaning of salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Salvation means to be forgiven and delivered from sin.</li>
	<li>Furthermore, salvation means to receive life and be resurrected.</li>
	<li>Salvation also includes being ascended and transcended.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The source of salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The grace of God is the source of salvation.</li>
	<li>Grace comes from love. Grace is an active issue, and love is an intention of the heart. So the act of grace is an issue coming from the loving intention of the heart.</li>
	<li>Because grace is free, salvation is not by works.</li>
	<li>Since it is by grace and not by works, salvation is out of God and not out of ourselves.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The means of salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Salvation is not by works, but by faith.</li>
	<li>Grace is the dispensing; faith is the receiving. The dispensing grace and the receiving faith make salvation complete.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>That man may not boast in himself. Since salvation is not by the works of man, nor out of man, there is no room for man to boast.</li>
	<li>That God may be man&rsquo;s boast and glory.</li>
	</ol></li>
