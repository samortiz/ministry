   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED OF THE TRUTH LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lesson one is concerning the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If I were to ask you when the books of the Bible were written and when these books were recognized as part of the Scripture, probably not many would be able to tell me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may treasure this book, yet many thoughtful people would ask you to tell them how this book was written.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You believe in the Bible, study it, preach it, and teach it, yet you do not know how it was written.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the purpose of having the truth lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first lesson is to impress the students with the proper, common, necessary knowledge concerning the Bible s coming into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the first volume was published, all the saints in Taipei wanted to take the first level.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because they do not know many of the things in the first level, they want to learn from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Taipei all the saints began the truth lessons from the first grade.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some of them have been in the church life for over thirty-seven years, but they all attended level one, volume one with some who had just been in the church life for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ones who had been recently saved did not know how the Bible was produced, and the ones who had been with us for over thirty-seven years and many of the leading ones did not know how the Bible was produced either.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows us the need of the truth lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If anyone continually attends these classes for four years, he will have a full and clear sketch, a full view, concerning the Bible, concerning God, concerning Christ, concerning the Spirit, concerning our salvation, and concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will provide a basic education.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then when the saints listen to the lectures by the experts, the big speakers, they will understand more because they have the basic vocabulary, the basic knowledge, of all the basic points concerning the divine, spiritual, and holy things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The truth lessons give people the basic knowledge, and may be likened to the textbooks in a school.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The messages for the small groups, the Lord s table, and the prayer meeting may be likened to newspapers or magazines for people s study and reading.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you had not studied in school, it would be hard to read a newspaper or magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>NOT SETTING UP A SEMINARY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BUT PASSING ON THE TRUTHS TO THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do not feel burdened to charge the saints to go home and study beyond what is in the truth lessons, but all the elders should promote the reading of the Recovery Version, the gold bar, in the homes plus all the Life-studies and other publications by the Living Stream Ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These will be their library books.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Besides attending the meetings to learn the truth, they should read these spiritual publications every day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to realize that actually we are not a school and we do not have graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our intention is solely to pass on the truths to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not give the saints any kind of written exams on the truth lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our church school does not have terms or vacations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most of the saints have to take care of their occupations and families in addition to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just to teach them the truth lessons is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let them pick up what they can.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After four years with four levels of lessons, everybody will be much better.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To set up a seminary is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not burdened to set up any school.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not go that far.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not want to set up a real church school to have graduates.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To have training meetings to train the saints is okay, but to set up a seminary is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That is going too far.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To have the trainings will not cause any opinions or trouble to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But to set up a seminary will cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You would have to decide something such as who the board members would be.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many troubles would then come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>NOT USING THE TRUTH LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>FOR THE CAMPUS WORK</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not use the truth lessons for the campus work to teach a Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people there have not been brought into salvation or into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The truth lessons are only useful for people in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We train them as our students.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one would open a textbook on the street and begin to teach the people there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The textbooks are used only for your enrolled students.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You would not go anywhere to teach people with lesson books.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have many messages and good material for you to go to the campus and use.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>TAKING THE HELP FROM THE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>TO GO ON BY THE SAME WAY</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am not narrow and I do not like to dictate, but by His mercy and grace I have gone through the proper process to get into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am so grateful that the Lord brought me into contact with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I could never forget him and I am still grateful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was surely the unique person, according to my observation, from whom I could get the unique help.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By His mercy I did get the help.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After that I spent more time to investigate and dig into the holy Word with the help of many reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I came to the United States, I had the boldness and the assurance to pass on what I had received to you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am not narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not like to dictate or control, yet I love you all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I do not like to see you waste your time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is why it seems I am so narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I would just ask you to study all the publications that come from the Living Stream Ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You may get some help elsewhere, but with the help there may be some poison.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I like to see you save your time to concentrate your entire being on the Lord s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You will get the best help within the shortest time, and be assured you will never be poisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is much purified.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What I expect is that all the churches around the globe will take the help from this ministry to go on by the same way that we may have the morale, the impact, to fight the strong battle for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have the full assurance that this is what the Lord needs in this age to bring Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is why I am so concerned to see anything that is a little different come into the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That will be a real damage.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I do not like to hear others uplifting me, but I want to see you get the real help and not be distracted by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>THE MINISTRY OF LIFE AND THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>TO OPEN UP THE HOLY WORD</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You can assuredly receive two things from the ministry the ministry of life and the way to open up the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This ministry does not lead anyone into the ministry itself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This ministry actually leads and ushers the reader into the real divine revelation of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is the best opener of the holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Any page of this ministry will lead you into a certain verse, chapter, or book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I have the assurance that this ministry would never lead anyone astray.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It will always help people into the right way of God s New Testament economy according to His entire revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We surely have to thank the Lord for what He has been doing and is still going to do among us.</S>
