<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Greetings to X in the Lord:</p><p>I received The Open Door twice and read both issues. Thank and praise the Lord. He really showed me that He is calling His children to do His holy work. This calling is one throughout the entire country. It is progressing by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and it is real. In addition to praying for the work, may the brothers and sisters in each locality be like the ones on whose behalf Paul gave thanks and whom Paul exhorted and comforted (see 1 Cor. 15:57-58). Amen!</p><p>The Lord's little worker,<br />Lo Jen-shuan<br />April 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Kuei-yang, Kweichow Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother in the Lord, Yu-zhi:</p><p>There are too few people in Kweichow for the Lord's work. Kuei-yang only has one China Inland Mission. The pastor is more than seventy years old. Truthfully, Kuei-yang does not have one worker who really preaches the gospel. The Lord has prepared the meeting place for you to preach the gospel. May the Lord's Spirit lead you to come to Kweichow.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Heng-chiu<br />April 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>If your work is not finished, you must, of course, continue until you arrive at a goal. If you could come in May, that would be good. Pastor Zhia Yu-ming will come to preach the gospel in Kuei-yang. It will probably be in April or May. The general situation in Kuei-yang is as follows: It has the highest standard of living in China, especially in the daily necessities. Food and lodging cost about as much as in Nanking and Shanghai. The people are all filled with the sins of a big city, but there are not as many places for them to go to sin. The city is too small for it. (The population is a little more than one hundred thousand.) The weather is mild but very rainy. There can also be great changes in temperature. There is only a Gospel Chapel from the China Inland Mission in the city. (There are also two Catholic churches.) Its worship service has forty-five people at the most. Ordinary meetings have anywhere from a few to twenty in attendance. These are all the Christians in Kuei-yang. However, they all love the Lord. Therefore, the offering every week is more than X dollars. In comparison with some localities in other provinces, where the number of people is in the hundreds but the collection is only a few dollars, this is really much better, isn't it? There are two families where the entire household has believed in the Lord. They are the Yeh family and the Cheng family. Our church recently rented a large building with three floors on a major street. It is very suitable for conferences. I think that the Lord has prepared a place for you to work. The building we rented is like the one in Kuling. It can be used for preaching the gospel and as a bookstore. Unfortunately, we do not have any books to put out. If you have books, please bring them or send them. Please write to the Shanghai Gospel Book Room and ask them to send a large quantity to sell. What do you think about this? I am now working in the Department of Agricultural Reform in Kweichow. May the grace of the Lord be with you always.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Heng-chiu<br />April 6</p>
