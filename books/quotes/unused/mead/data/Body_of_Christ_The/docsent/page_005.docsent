   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The all-inclusive Triune God has a consummation, and this consummation is the compound, all-inclusive, and life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, we are under the sealing of such a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the other hand, we are with this Spirit as the pledge of the all-inclusive, processed Triune God for our foretaste during the church age and our full taste in the coming age for eternity v. 14 . We have not only a sealing but also a pledging going on within us.</S>
