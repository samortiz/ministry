   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Not Brought under the Power of Anything</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 12 Paul twice says, All things are lawful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first use of these words is somewhat objective; the second use is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul says, All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Literally the Greek words rendered be brought under the power of mean to be brought under the authority of.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All things are under my power, but I will not be brought under the power authority of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All things are permissible, allowable, lawful, to me, but I will not be ruled enslaved or brought under the authority, the control, of any.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 12 may be considered a proverb that governs the apostle s dealings with some problems in the following section, from 6:13 through 11:1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you consider whether or not to do a certain thing, you should ask if you are under the power or control of that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a particular thing controls you or has power over you, you should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, you may wonder if you should eat certain foods.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It may be all right to eat those foods, but they should not have any power over you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must fully deal with anything that has power over us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OUR BODY FOR THE LORD A. Foods for the Belly, and the Belly for Foods</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 13 Paul goes on to say, Foods are for the belly and the belly for foods; but God will bring to nothing both it and them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Foods and the belly are for the existence of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By themselves they do not mean anything; God will bring them to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul s composition here may seem awkward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He says, God will bring to nothing both it and them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we were writing this verse, we might say, God will bring both to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if the verse were written in this way, the meaning and significance would be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By referring to both it and them, Paul means both the belly and the foods.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He refers to the belly first because God will bring it to nothing before He brings foods to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason for this is that the abuse of freedom in the matter of eating is not caused by the food; it is caused by the belly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The problem comes not from the food itself, but from the belly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After a person s belly has been brought to nothing, food will no longer be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Food is for the belly, and the belly is for food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God uses these things so that we may exist for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But one day God will bring both the belly and the foods to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. The Body Not for Fornication but for the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>and the Lord for the Body</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 13 Paul also says, But the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our body was created for the Lord, and the Lord within us is for our body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He feeds it with material food Psa 103:5 and gives it His resurrection life Rom 8:11 , which swallows its death element with its weakness and sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually He will transfigure it, conforming it to His glorious body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not abuse it by fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, Paul says that the belly is for food; on the other hand, he tells us that the body is not for fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are free to eat what we choose, but we may not commit fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if we eat excessively, we shall cause damage to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, although we are free to eat, we should be careful to eat in a healthy way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our appetite easily runs wild.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, it needs to be bridled, restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although Paul says that the body is for the Lord and the Lord for the body, he does not say that God is either for the belly or for foods.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God will bring both the belly and the foods to nothing, but the Lord will not bring our body to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our body is for the Lord, and the Lord is for our body.</S>
