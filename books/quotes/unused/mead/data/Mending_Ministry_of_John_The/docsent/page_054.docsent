   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRIMMING AND INFILLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the nature of this priestly speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Old Testament there was the lampstand in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every morning these lamps were trimmed by having their charred wicks snuffed Exo 30:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition, they were kept supplied with oil 27:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To trim is to cut off the charred ends which would no longer burn brightly; to add oil is to supply what is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Revelation 2 and 3 our High Priest was trimming the seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was cutting away those things which were not needed and which frustrated the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the same time He was supplying the oil which was needed and which would make the lampstands burn brightly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The seven lampstands were receiving His trimming and His infilling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Trimming Religion</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of all the things He trimmed away, to me the most striking is the synagogue of Satan Rev 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Are you familiar with this term?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That the Lord speaks of Judaism in such a way indicates that by the time of the church age, Judaism had become satanic.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are a Jewish believer, subconsciously you may still be for Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you hear that it has become satanic, you may want to protest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nonetheless, this is the word of our heavenly High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, He uses the term a second time in 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A synagogue is the symbol of Judaism, just as a building with a steeple is a symbol of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In any present-day town, whether here or in other countries, if we see a building with a steeple and a bell, we recognize it as a symbol of Christianity; if we see a synagogue, we know it is a symbol of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the church dispensation this symbol of Judaism became the synagogue of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is utilized by him in rebellion against God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I surely love the Jews because they are God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet to speak the truth I must say that today Judaism is in rebellion against God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Who sentenced the Son of God to death?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was not Pilate; nor was it Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Judaism must take the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The high priest and then the other Jews called for His death John 18:13-14; 19:14-15; Matt 27:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What can we learn from this?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our old religious concepts are against God's economy and need to be trimmed away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These concepts are black, charred, and dark.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are one of the things which hinder the shining of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, we need our High Priest to step in and trim them away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Trimming Worldliness</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another thing which chars the wick is worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This our heavenly High Priest cannot tolerate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Pergamos Rev 2:12-17 speaks of the marriage of the church with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord again steps in to trim the wick.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You who live in New York are surely living in a worldly city.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Apart from the church, I certainly would not like to live here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We heard a brother from Texas give a testimony that when he got on the subway, he said, "Lord, take me back to Texas.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It's not so worldly there."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The truth is, Texas has its own worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may think that those who live in the countryside are spared from worldliness, but this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The country has its worldliness too.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All this worldliness, symbolized by Pergamos, must be trimmed away.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Trimming Evil</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Lord comes to the church in Thyatira, He condemns them for tolerating the woman Jezebel Rev 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Who is this evil woman He calls Jezebel?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She "calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Catholic Church is full of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The woman Jezebel is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All that she represents must be trimmed away.</S>
