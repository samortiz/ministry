This is what Hebrews 9 shows us. It tells us that the blood of bulls and goats did not do a complete job. Chapter ten says that if a complete job had been done, there would have no longer been consciousness of sins. God reckoned that the work of bulls and goats was incomplete according to the conscience, because every time a person's conscience lost its peace, he felt that his sins had not yet been fully taken care of, and there was the need for further offerings.</P><P>However, the apostle shows us that a Christian does not have to do the same thing. The propitiatory sacrifice that God has set up in the New Testament is not a bull or goat but His very own Son. When His Son came to the earth, He said plainly that God did not desire nor delight in bulls and goats. Instead, God prepared a body for Him that He might die to accomplish the work of eternal redemption. The Lord has accomplished on the cross the sacrifice for eternal redemption. Now we are able to obtain this eternal redemption. He has offered up a sacrifice of eternal redemption, thus accomplishing an eternal redemption. Because of this eternal redemption, we are eternally perfected. He is the Son of God. Because His eternal work has been accomplished once, we do not need to offer up sin offerings anymore. We cannot offer up a sin offering for the same sin any longer, for the Lord Jesus has accomplished all the work.</P><P>The Son of God cannot be crucified for our sins again. One cannot trample underfoot the blood of God's Son and make it something common. If something is one of a kind, it is precious. But if there are two of a kind, they are common. To treat the blood of the Son as common means to consider it the same as the blood of bulls and goats. But if you honor His blood and consider it as something unique, it will be precious to you. Here is the sin offering which He has accomplished. After the Lord has accomplished this work, God said that there cannot be any other work. The Son of God cannot die again. His work is finished. If you want it, you have to trust Him for it. You cannot add anything to it. Either you depend on Him or you have nothing. After a man has been enlightened by the truth, there is no more sacrifice for sins for him. There is only one sin offering. This is what we preach to others. Those who come to worship through this one sacrifice will have their consciences cleansed. They will no longer have the consciousness of sins. All their sins are washed away, and there is no more consciousness of sins. Furthermore, there is no need for another cleansing. The Bible never teaches the doctrine of a second cleansing. The blood of the Lord Jesus cannot cleanse us again. Once we have been cleansed, we are cleansed forever.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_263.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_265.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Gospel of God, The (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 264</div><br></body></html>
