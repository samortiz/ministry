   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Furthermore, while you should avoid overeating, you should not allow your stomach to be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do not think that because you are still young, you are strong enough to hold yourself up.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eventually you will fall sick.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am really concerned for a certain brother who loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has been laboring for the Lord faithfully, but because he is overly fatigued, the level of his white blood cells has gone up too high.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now he is in the hospital getting emergency care.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, I believe that the Lord will heal him, and we should also pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I mention this as a warning to all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not think that since you are still young and have inexhaustible energy, you can use it excessively all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must always remember that we are limited.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition, be sure to drink sufficient water at least twelve big glasses every day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Water is for the cleansing of our whole system; taking plenty of fluid keeps our system cleansed all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A study which was done in America on the young soldiers who were killed in the Vietnam War found that more than one-third of them had blood vessels that were blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that they did not eat properly and had taken in too much fat, so that even in their twenties and thirties they already had the problem of clogged blood vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>American foods are very nutritious, yet the probability of Americans having high blood pressure, heart disease, and strokes is also quite high.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should take this as a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, it is good to drink some water after each meal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition, you must have at least half an hour of exercise every day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Any kind of exercise will do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may practice shadowboxing, or you may jog or walk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, there is no need to be so regimented; just let your body move around a little bit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After a meal, spend ten minutes to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Walking is in fact the best exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I spend at least half an hour walking every day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever I feel uncomfortable, I stand up and take a walk, and after fifteen minutes of walking I feel comfortable again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1948 after Brother Nee resumed his ministry, he gave us some statistics.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He said that due to the lack of knowledge about nutrition and due also to the poor living situation, out of the more than twenty co-workers who died at that time, only one was killed by the Communist Party, while ninety percent of the rest died of tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Nee said that it was for this reason that he went into the pharmaceutical business, for which he was condemned and opposed so much that he had to stop his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said that if it was wrong for him to go into business, he was forced to do so because he was just like a widow forced to remarry for the survival of her children.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He went into business because he could not bear to see the co-workers dying one by one of malnutrition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As he spoke this word, everyone in the meeting, including himself, wept.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before that time I had never seen Brother Nee shedding tears.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In fact, that was also the only time I ever saw him weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time I was sitting beside him, and I also wept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not have a financial problem in our present situation, especially in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, we should not eat, drink, and enjoy anything as we like simply because we are wealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is to commit gradual suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that we could live to be eighty or ninety, even to over a hundred, so that we might be able to see the fulfillment of all that we have fellowshipped today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I wish to live on this earth and witness with my own eyes the truth of the Lord not only being printed into books through our hands, but also being sent through us to every part of the world and prevailing in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I absolutely believe that this will hasten the Lord's return because it is through this that the Lord will prepare His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that we all can see the manifestation of such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Finally, for the sake of our physical health, we should not quarrel with people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>More cells in your body are killed when you quarrel, argue, or get angry than when you catch a cold.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, remember that you should not get angry about anything or with anybody; in particular, husbands and wives should not be angry with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By the Lord's grace, you should receive this kind of exhortation so that you might prolong your days on earth and be more useful in the Lord's hand.</S>
