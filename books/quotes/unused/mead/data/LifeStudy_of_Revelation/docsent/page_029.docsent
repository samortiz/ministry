   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Concerning God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider the progress of the divine revelation in the Scriptures in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Firstly, God reveals Himself to us Gen 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 1:26 God is revealed as Elohim, a Hebrew word meaning the mighty One.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The English word God is the translation of the Hebrew word Elohim.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Following this, in Genesis 2:7 God is revealed as Jehovah, which means, I am that I am.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is the great I Am, the ever-existing One.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the ever-existing One, He is the reality of every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This name, Jehovah, denotes God in His relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning His creation, God is revealed as Elohim; concerning His relationship with man, He is revealed as Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jehovah is the Old Testament form of the name Jesus, and Jesus is the New Testament form of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, in the Old Testament Jesus was called Jehovah, and in the New Testament Jehovah is called Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The entire Old Testament, which comprises thirty-nine books, is mainly a revelation of the two divine titles, Elohim and Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Concerning Christ</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second step in the progress of the divine revelation is the revelation concerning Christ Matt 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At a certain time, God was incarnated as a man called Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, following the Old Testament, we have the four Gospels which reveal a wonderful Person named Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The name Jesus mainly means the Savior Matt 1:21 , and the title Christ mainly means the anointed One Matt 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus is not only our Savior but also God s anointed One or, using today s term, God s appointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has appointed Him to carry out His eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is not only Jesus to save us, but also Christ to carry out God s eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order for Christ to carry out God s eternal plan, He needs the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And to produce the church there is the need of two things redemption and the imparting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After redeeming the fallen, created man, Christ had to impart life into the redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this, there is the need of the Spirit of life, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, following the four Gospels, we have redemption and the imparting of life in the Acts and the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In these books, the blood of Christ is frequently mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Along with the blood, we have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Blood is for redemption, and the Spirit is for the imparting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After being redeemed and regenerated, we become the living members of the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the church, the Body is the means by which Christ carries out God s eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this we see that in God s economy the church is a very crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without it, Christ cannot accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If He would carry out God s eternal plan, He must have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>C. Concerning the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is revealed as Elohim and as Jehovah, and Christ is revealed as Jesus and as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The revelation concerning the Spirit, however, is not simple Matt 28:19 ; rather, it is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Few Christians have ever fought for the revelation of God, and not many have fought for the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when we come to the matter of the Spirit, there is much argument because the revelation of the Spirit is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit is mysterious because it is related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are many aspects of the revelation of the Spirit: the Spirit of truth or reality John 14:16-17 , the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the Spirit of power Luke 24:49 , the Spirit of God Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , the Holy Spirit Acts 5:32 , and the seven Spirits Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you know the difference between the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those in the so-called Pentecostal or charismatic movement talk about the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only the Lord knows whether or not they have the genuine power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have heard much so-called speaking in tongues, but I have not seen power in the work of these tongues speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The baptism of the Holy Spirit empowers people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But so many of the supposed tongues speakers today are just as powerless as the non-tongues speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They may have the power to babble incoherently, but they do not have the power to save souls.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although some never have spoken such tongues, thousands of people have been saved through their preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is real power.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not only is there no real power in the so-called charismatic movement; neither is there any life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After speaking in tongues, many will proceed to fight with their wives or to smoke cigarettes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is this life?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Life transforms people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need both the Spirit of power and the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are here for the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This testimony is not a term or a form; it is a life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How we need to open up ourselves to Him that He may impart more life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we truly have Christ as our life, we shall walk, live, and behave ourselves in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now we can understand why the Epistles repeatedly speak about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As we have seen, the book of Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For the church life, there is the need of this intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Out of this intensified Spirit, the real church comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>While I do not oppose any genuine Pentecostal gifts, I can testify that in the past I have not seen one proper church built up by the so-called Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Consider the Catholic charismatic movement today: it is saturated with the worship of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If this movement is proper, how could it tolerate idol worship?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That it tolerates idolatry proves that it is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Dirt can be added to a snowball, but not to a diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The so-called charismatic movement is like a snowball to which unclean things can be added.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our eyes need to be opened to see that today God desires the real, living, and practical local churches.</S>
