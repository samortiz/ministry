Christ as the Grain of Wheat<br>Producing, in His Resurrection, Many Grains<br>for the Dispensing of His Divine Life<br>into His Many Believers<br>That They May Be His Many Members</H2><P>In His resurrection Christ as the grain of wheat produced many grains for the dispensing of His divine life into His many believers that they may be His many members (John 12:24). Christ was the one grain of wheat. He fell into the earth and died, and then He grew up. By His growing up, a kind of dispensing took place in which the many grains were produced to be the many members of His Body. In the past we realized that the many grains were the fruit of Christ as the one grain of wheat. But we did not realize that the producing of the many grains was altogether a matter of dispensing. Without the dispensing of the divine life, the many grains could not have been produced. We as the many grains are the issue of Christ's dispensing of His divine life into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God the Father Regenerating Us,<br>the Believers, through Christ's Resurrection<br>for the Dispensing of His Divine Life into Us<br>That We May Be His Many Sons</H2><P>God the Father regenerated us, the believers, through Christ's resurrection for the dispensing of His divine life into us that we may be His many sons (1 Pet. 1:3). The resurrection of Christ was a dispensing. As the many grains, we were produced to be Christ's many members. As the many believers, we were born to be God's many sons. The producing of the many grains and the regenerating of the many sons was carried out by the same procedure of the divine dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ as the Last Adam Becoming,<br>in His Resurrection, the Life-giving Spirit<br>for the Dispensing of the Divine Life<br>to Germinate the New Testament Believers</H2><P>In His resurrection Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit for the dispensing of the divine life to germinate the New Testament believers that they may become God's new creation (1 Cor. 15:45b). In Christ's resurrection we sinners have all been made three things: the many grains, the many sons, and the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). The many grains are the many sons, and the many sons are the new creation. These three things are all due to the dispensing of the divine life and nature into us. By this dispensing we become the members of Christ's Body, the many sons in God's household, and the new creation. In the past, we did see that we are the many members of Christ's Body, the many sons of God's household, and the new creation; but we did not see so clearly that the crucial point concerning these three things is the dispensing of divinity into humanity. Today this dispensing is still going on.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_138.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_140.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 139</div><br></body></html>
