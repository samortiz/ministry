<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Blood Being for God's Judicial Redemption</H2><P>The blood of Christ is for God's judicial redemption in His redeeming the believers (Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18-19), forgiving the believers' sins (Heb. 9:22), and washing away the believers' sins (Heb. 1:3). The blood of Christ is also for God to justify the believers (Rom. 3:24; 5:9) and sanctify the believers positionally (Heb. 13:12; 10:29). This blood speaks something better for the New Testament believers before God (Heb. 12:24). By the blood of Christ, the Lamb, we can overcome Satan, the accuser of the believers (Rev. 12:11). Thus, it is the precious blood of Christ (1 Pet. 1:19).</P><P>It is also considered God's own blood, which is very dear to God and with which God has purchased and obtained the church as His flock. Acts 20:28 says that God secured, purchased, redeemed, the church with His own blood. If He were merely God, He could not have blood. God's own blood is the blood of the man Jesus Christ, who is the very God. God's purchasing the church with His own blood indicates the preciousness, the exceeding worth, of the church in the eyes of God. The church is dear to God, so we have to regard and respect the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Water Signifying the Divine Life<br>for God's Organic Salvation</H2><P>Water, signifying the divine life (see Message Three), is for God's organic salvation. The Lord promises to give the sinners the water of life (John 4:10, 14; Rev. 21:6).</P><P>Also, the Lord calls the sinners to come and drink His water of life (Rev. 22:17; John 7:37-38). The believers were regenerated by God with His divine life (1 Pet. 1:3). This divine life saves the believers (Rom. 5:10b). It dispositionally sanctifies (Rom. 6:19, 22), renews (Rom. 12:2b; Titus 3:5), transforms (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18), conforms (Rom. 8:29), and glorifies (Rom. 8:30) the believers. The believers reign in it (Rom. 5:17). We can be kings by this divine life. The believers also grow with it for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:15-16). We all have to grow into the Head, Christ. Then out from Him we have something of the divine life to minister to the Body for its building up. This consummates the New Jerusalem, which is wholly supplied with the river of water of life and with the tree of life (Rev. 21:2; 22:1-2). The river of water of life signifies the Spirit of life, and the tree of life signifies Christ as the embodiment of the divine life. Both are for the supply of the New Jerusalem.</P>
