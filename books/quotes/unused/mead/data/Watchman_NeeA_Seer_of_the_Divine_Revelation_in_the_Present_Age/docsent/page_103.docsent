   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WATCHMAN NEE'S MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Out of Watchman Nee's revelations inwrought by his sufferings, a ministry came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His ministry was clearly of two aspects: first, of Christ and, second, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His ministry was full, proper, and adequately balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have never known anyone so thoroughly and adequately balanced in the aspects of Christ and the church as Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He saw a clear vision of Christ, and he also received a full revelation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In his spoken ministry and in his publications as well, he was always properly balanced in these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many in the United States are aware that he put out book after book concerning Christ as life and Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But many may not realize that he also published book after book on the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning the church he covered two main points in his ministry: the content of the church and the practice of the church, or in other words, the reality of the church and the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The content and the reality of the church are Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Watchman saw the vision that Christ is not merely for the believers individually but even more for the church corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His vision was unlike those who are today considered to be spiritual people; they hold that Christ is mostly for Christians as individuals while caring little for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They even fear to speak about the church, for they realize that whenever the matter of the church is raised, a problem is created, and they would rather steer clear of all problems.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Watchman Nee's vision of Christ was that Christ is for individual believers to enjoy in order to be built up in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, the Christ whom we experience becomes the reality and the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Watchman also saw that this reality of the church is also practical and that we need the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, he ministered both the reality and the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reality of the church is the content, and the practicality of the church is its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is not just for individual Christians but for the corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And the Christ we enjoy as Christians individually is entirely for the building up of the corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason Christ is both the content of the church and the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church's reality is simply Christ realized by many individual Christians in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To match this reality, we need the church practice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we stay at home and hold Christ as the reality, there will be no church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even though we might hold the reality individually, we would be short of the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christians need to come together and to be built together; each one needs to come out of his little cell and into one big cell, under one roof, to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we not only have the reality, but also the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These were the two main points of Watchman Nee's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Watchman's ministry regarding Christ as our life was fully accepted; but his ministry regarding the church was frequently rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many have received help from his ministry regarding Christ as life, but those same people would not take his ministry regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many bookstores carry his books on Christ as life, but purposely will not carry his books on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some publishers publish his books on Christ as life with great appreciation for his ministry in this aspect, yet they condemn his ministry on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Publishers and booksellers have even done their best to hide his ministry on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We fully agree that his books concerning Christ should be published, for they are marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But it is altogether unfair and dishonest to hide his books on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A rumor was even spread after World War II that Watchman Nee changed his concept concerning the practicality of the church life and the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is absolutely not true.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His book Further Talks on the Church Life documents and shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that after 1948, rather than changing his concept concerning the church, he ministered even more strongly than before concerning his original vision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In one of these messages, given shortly before his imprisonment, he said that what he saw in 1937 concerning the church was absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He rather confirmed what he had seen before; he did not change at all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was faithful to the Lord's vision and commission concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During his whole life, his ministry was for Christ and the church not for Christ only, but for Christ and the church.</S>
