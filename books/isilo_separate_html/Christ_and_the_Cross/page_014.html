AND THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Concerning the church, 1 Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; This verse shows that the church is one Body with many members. However, the verse does not end with <em>so also is the church</em> but with <em>so also is the Christ.</em> This shows that the church as the Body of Christ is Christ, because it is His Body. Both our head and our body are us. We cannot say that only our head is us. Every person has a head and a body. The head and the body form a complete person. This also applies to Christ. He is the Head, and His church is the Body. Just as the Head is Christ, the Body is also Christ. Both the Head and the Body are Christ. If the Head is Christ, then the Body is also Christ. Just as the Head is Christ, the Body is also Christ. The Head and the Body are the corporate Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CORPORATE CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Bible speaks of the individual Christ and the corporate Christ. The individual Christ is the Lord Jesus. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, Peter received a revelation from the Father that He was the Christ (Matt. 16:16-17). The Lord Jesus later repeated that He was the Christ (26:63-64; Mark 14:61-62). After the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, the Spirit made it clear through Peter that God had made Jesus both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). These verses refer to the individual Christ, the Lord Jesus Himself. However, there are verses related to Christ in the Bible that do not refer to Him as the individual Christ. First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; In this verse the words <em>the Christ</em> include the many members who form the one Body; hence, this verse refers to the corporate Christ. The corporate Christ is composed of the individual Christ, that is, Christ Himself, and of the church, that is, all the believers. Christ plus all the believers form the corporate Christ. The individual Christ is the Head of the corporate Christ, and all the believers constitute the Body of the corporate Christ. Just as the Head has the life of Christ, the Body also has the life of Christ. The Head and the Body are the same, even one, in the life of Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is Christ, and the church that is joined to Him in His life is also Christ. The many believers who have His life are a part of Christ. Every believer is a member of the corporate Christ, the Body of Christ. Corporately, we are Christ, and individually, we are a part of Christ. The many parts of Christ together with Christ Himself are the corporate Christ, the mysterious, universal Christ. The universal, mysterious, corporate Christ is not limited by time or space and fully expresses Christ in the universe. Hence, the church is the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE FULLNESS<br />
OF THE ONE WHO FILLS ALL IN ALL</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:23 says that the church, which is His Body, is &ldquo;the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; The second half of this verse is a word of explanation, indicating that the meaning of the church, as the Body of Christ, is that the church is the fullness of the One who fills all in all. As the One who fills all in all, Christ the Lord is exceedingly rich, and His riches need a Body in order to be expressed. This Body is His fullness. If a person wants his riches to be adequately expressed, he needs not only a head but also a body. Only a head with a body can express a person&rsquo;s riches. This is the function of the church to Christ. As the One who fills all in all, Christ needs a corporate, universal Body for His expression. Christ is too rich; hence, He wants to produce the church as His Body to fully express His riches. This Body is the fullness of Christ, the overflow of His riches.</p>
<p>A cup overflowing with water is an example. Christ can be compared to the water, and the church can be compared to the overflowing water. The church is the overflow of Christ, the fullness of Christ. The water in the cup is the same as the water overflowing from the cup; likewise, Christ and the church as His overflow are the same. The fullness of Christ is His Body formed with a group of people whom He fills to be His corporate vessel. This corporate vessel contains the overflow of Christ so that He may be expressed in the universe. A man&rsquo;s body is his fullness, and the church is Christ&rsquo;s fullness. The life of my head is expressed through my body, and the life of Christ is expressed through the church.</p>
<p>Eve was the overflow of Adam, his fullness to express his riches, and the church is the overflow of Christ, His fullness to express His riches. When we see Eve, we see the fullness of Adam, his overflow. Similarly, when we see the church, we see the fullness of Christ, His overflow; hence, the church is Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
