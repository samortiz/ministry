   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>On earth the Lord's name is excellent; above the heavens is the Lord's splendor, His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In between there are the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger, who are stopped by the praise of strength that comes out of the mouths of the smallest ones and the weakest ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is God's marvelous consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The highest consummation of the Lord's work in His redemption is to perfect the praise to Him out of the mouths of the smallest and the weakest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord does this because of His adversaries, with the purpose of stopping the enemy and the avenger.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Chinese translation shows that to stop the enemy and the avenger means to shut up their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today before the Lord and God, Satan's mouth has been shut up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the whole universe, there are many voices.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The adversaries have their voices, the enemy has his voice, and the avenger has his voice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But all these voices have been stopped by the overcoming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has overcome all of God's enemies in the entire universe, so He can perfect the praise to Him out of the mouths of the smallest and weakest persons, in order to stop the voices of His enemy and His avenger.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 3 says, "When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers,/The moon and the stars, which You have ordained."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>David did not say that he saw the heavens, but he saw "Your heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have a hymn on this psalm in our hymnal Hymns, #1097 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the second stanza of that hymn, the writer referred to the sun, the moon, and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The writer added the word sun, but this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Psalm 8 David saw only the moon and the stars, not the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot see the sun, the moon, and the stars at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we see the moon and the stars, we cannot see the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The moon and the stars in Psalm 8 indicate that it was in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the nighttime, everything is dark.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the psalmist lifted up his eyes to look at our Father's heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the night he saw the moon and the stars which God had ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The scientific experts can bear witness to this ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The divine ordination of the moon and the stars is truly a wonder.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the psalmist turned his view from the messy earth to the bright heavens, he said, "What is man, that You remember him,/And the son of man, that You visit him?" v. 4 . He turned his view from the moon and the stars in the heavens back to man on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, God remembers man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, He visits man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to understand this in a poetic way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God in the heavens remembered man before He became incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then He came to visit man by becoming a man through His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Triune God came to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before coming to us, He remembered us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Triune God was very busy, yet He remembered us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then according to His remembrance of us, He became incarnated to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As believers of Jesus, we surely have been visited by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Each day when I pray, I experience the Lord's visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He comes to me in the way of incarnation; in the way of His human living; in the way of His crucifixion; in the way of His resurrection; in the way of His ascension; and in the way of His descension.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord is there in my study room as I spend time with Him in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all need to enjoy the Lord's visitation day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the Lord Jesus had never gone through all the above processes, how could He be with us today?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is now with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to visit us, the Lord did not simply drop down from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He took a long journey.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord has remembered us and also visited us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is with us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we did not have the visitation of the Lord, we would be pitiful.</S>
