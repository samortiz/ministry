   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY GOVERNMENTAL FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are at least four different kinds of forgiveness in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will give a different name to each of them: First, there is eternal forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, there is instrumental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Third, there is forgiveness in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fourth, there is governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a believer desires to run a straight course in his spiritual pursuit, he must learn the meaning of God s governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will first distinguish the differences between these kinds of forgiveness, and then we will speak about governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. ETERNAL FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us call the forgiveness that comes with our salvation God s eternal forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the forgiveness spoken of by the Lord Jesus in Luke 24:47: That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is eternal forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The forgiveness spoken of in Romans 4:7 is eternal forgiveness as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This forgiveness is called eternal forgiveness because once God forgives our sins, He forgives them eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God casts our sins into the depths of the sea and the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He no longer sees or remembers our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the forgiveness we obtained at the time we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The moment we believe in the Lord Jesus, we are forgiven of all our sins; the Lord removes all of our sins, and we are left with no trace of sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is called eternal forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>INSTRUMENTAL FORGIVENESS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God often tells man directly, I forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But often He declares His forgiveness through the church: God has forgiven your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the Bible shows us another kind of forgiveness which we call instrumental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 20:22-23 says, And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In sending the Holy Spirit to His church, the Lord charged the church to be His representative on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church has become His vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Forgiveness is now granted through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is called instrumental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, we must be careful not to fall into the kind of forgiveness taught by the Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must realize that the basis of instrumental forgiveness is the Lord s breathing into the church and saying to the church, Receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the church receives the Holy Spirit, it has the power to retain and forgive sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church can declare that the sins of certain ones are retained, while the sins of others are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church has such authority because it is under the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord breathed into the disciples and said, Receive the Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After this He said, Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a kind of indirect forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this forgiveness God forgives men through the church; the church acts as His channel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In preaching the gospel, we often find sinners who are awakened to their sin by our word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We bring them to the Lord, and they confess that they are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They pray for forgiveness with weeping and tears of repentance, and they receive the Lord Jesus with a sincere heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But they do not know the meaning of forgiveness because they are heathens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At such times, it is good for a representative of the church to stand up and say to them, God has forgiven you of your sins!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This will save them much suffering and anxious searching.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a person has truly believed, you may say to him, You have accepted the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You can thank Him because He has forgiven you of your sins!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the church cannot forgive or retain men s sins, it has no way to decide who may be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why do you accept one candidate for baptism while refusing another?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why do you receive some for the bread-breaking meeting while refusing others?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is an exercise of the authority that the church has received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It proclaims who is saved and who is not, and whose sins are forgiven and whose are retained.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such declarations must not be made in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those whose sins are forgiven are forgiven, while those whose sins are retained have their sins retained.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such a statement must be made under the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John 20:22 says, Receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 23 continues, Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only when the church has received the Holy Spirit and is under the authority of the Holy Spirit can it act as an instrument to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only after the Lord has made a man an instrument can he proclaim to a sinner, You are forgiven of your sins! or to another sinner, Your sins are not forgiven!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the second kind of forgiveness described in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this forgiveness, God does not forgive directly; He does it through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eternal forgiveness is God s direct forgiveness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instrumental forgiveness is God s proclamation of forgiveness through man.</S>
