   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues" 1 Cor 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Helps" refers to the services of the deacons; "governments," to the functions of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why did Paul list the services of the deacons ahead of the functions of the elders?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Note that "diversities of tongues" is last; that is where tongues-speaking always is!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It may be that at Corinth the elders thought too much in terms of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul wanted them to know that they were not the head.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is best not to say that the elders represent the headship of Christ; the Scriptures do not say so, and they must not think of themselves as subheads.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Peter underscored this in his first Epistle: "Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock" 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The elders are not leaders but examples.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I was in Scotland, I saw how the shepherds took care of their flocks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever a sheep went astray, the shepherds would order one of the sheep dogs after it to bring it back into line.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not the kind of shepherding Peter referred to!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there is some cleaning to be done, for example, the elders should take the lead to do it, not ask others to take care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord said, "Neither be called leaders, because One is your Leader, the Christ" Matt 23:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"You are all brothers" v. 8 . These verses indicate that in the New Testament economy God does not want any permanent, official leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament the eldership is always plural.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Which elder will be number one depends on two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the example of Peter illustrates, it is decided according to the spiritual measure and condition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The elders' positions may vary from week to week.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The one who was up last week may be fighting with his wife this week, and the leadership may pass to another elder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Leadership also depends upon spiritual ability.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An elder may have ability in a certain area; he will take the lead in that, while in another area another elder will be responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By such a flexible leadership the church is kept from hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is also safeguarded from error.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If Peter had been an official leader, he might have introduced a wrong concept about Judaism during his time of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Elsewhere in human society there is no such leadership as this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How wise is our God!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This leadership is plural, not single; temporary, not fixed; conditional, not organizational; spiritual, not official.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It has position but no rank.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"The greater among you shall be your servant" Matt 23:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you want to be great among the saints, you must be a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the service of the church you may take the lead to vacuum the carpet, but this "leadership" has no rank.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hebrews 13:17 admonishes us to "Obey the ones leading you and submit to them."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are to obey the leading ones in serving, but this does not make the leading ones lords, having rank over the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That would make them the head and insult the headship of Christ.</S>
