   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank the Lord that since the publication of this book in the fall of 1928, believers from various places have put in orders for it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Within a short time, we sold out of the first edition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many have undauntedly told us how they have experienced deliverance through the truth recorded in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This makes us realize that God's commission to us has not been in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We really have to thank the Lord for the way this book has been received by God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since then, for about two years, we have not been able to offer this book in its complete three-volume set.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Originally, I had no intention to print the second edition, thinking that two thousand copies in circulation would be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the same time, I was reluctant to hastily make another edition because I wanted to see how much result the outworking of the truth of this book would produce.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But during the past two years, there have been more than a few hundred requests for this book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have also seen from many testimonies that the truth of this book can be put into practice, that it can liberate men, and that it is what God's children need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, we feel that we cannot delay reprinting it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This edition is not much different from the first edition in teaching and in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, because of the new light and new awareness I received, which were not yet clear at the time I wrote the first edition, I have undertaken, with much effort, to make many changes and additions in this edition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In such an editing work, I have asked the Lord's help and tried my best to match the terms used in the book with those used in the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know that the terms that we use are often different from those used in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, we use the word "redemption" with reference to the whole of the Lord Jesus' work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the biblical meaning of the word "redemption" is only limited to the covering of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, there are many terms which sound right to us but are not accurate if judged by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, we all know the expressions "the overcoming of sins," "the crucifying of the self on the cross," and "the crucifixion of the soul-life" and what they refer to.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But these expressions are not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible does not have these things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible does not speak of "the overcoming of sins," but "the deliverance from sin" and "being freed from sin."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's way of salvation is not for us to overcome sin, but to crucify our old man so that we are delivered from sin and the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When this book uses the expression "overcoming sins," it is merely making reference to one's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Again, the Bible does not say that we should "die to the self," but that we should "deny the self."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One does not "crucify the self"; the self is dealt with by "taking up the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is because the self is our own personality and can never be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once the self dies, our own person dies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The self is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, we can only deny the self and take up the cross to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The meaning of bearing the cross is not to die, but to be willing to die.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, the Bible never says to "crucify the soul-life"; it only says to "lose the soul-life," for if our natural life is crucified, our physical life will be gone as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This does not mean that we were not aware of these distinctions in the first edition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we thought that if we were right in the spiritual facts and principles, outward terminology would not matter much.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While we were making changes even at this time, we did not try to correct these errors altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was during the past few days that the Lord reminded us to specifically take care of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has shown us how an inaccurate term can lead to inaccurate truths, and how accuracy in terminology is equally important.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Of course, we would rather have spiritual reality than accurate terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when we do have the spiritual reality, it is also valuable that we have the accurate terminology, not to mention that accurate terminology will afford us new light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we have changed our terms in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I hope that we can do the same in our other publications.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I would like the readers to pay attention to the subjective result of the truth in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, I have not mentioned many of the objective truths.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the nature of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was because I have felt that subjective truths are too few that I began to write this book.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the readers should know that the various truths mentioned in this book are not meant to be all that can be said about them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are merely an exposition of these truths in their subjective aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Soon this book will go out again to do the work that the Lord has allotted it to do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At this juncture, I can only feel the inadequacy of my writing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's truth always suffers loss at the hand of man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I can only say that all the glory should be to God and all the shame to me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May God bless what He can bless.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The author</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Shanghai, May 30, 1932</S>
