   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CARING FOR OTHERS SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us go on to see more verses in this book regarding the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter seven, verse 34, we read, The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to have a holy, human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in chapter eight, verse 12, we read, But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know that the conscience is the main part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By this verse we see how careful the Apostle Paul was in dealing with others conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He did this in order to maintain their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now notice chapter ten, verses 28 and 29: But if any man say unto you, this is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord s, and the fulness thereof: conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man s conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two verses prove again that in order to take care of others spirit we must take care of their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must not only maintain a strong spirit in ourselves, but see that others also have a strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we are weak in our conscience, we are weak in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we have a hole in our conscience, our spirit is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>SOWING SPIRITUAL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now go back to chapter nine, verse 11: If we have sown unto you spiritual things...</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This word spiritual things is the same word used in 12:1 and 14:1 for spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Apostle Paul is saying that he has sown something spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What was it?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Spiritual gifts?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Spiritual knowledge?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must realize that the spiritual thing sown by the Apostle Paul was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because according to chapter two, verse 2, the Apostle said that he determined not to know anything among them but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This proves that what the Apostle sowed was none other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>VERSES MENTIONING MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now let us look at the verses in chapter eleven relating to the matter of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 17 says, Ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 18: When ye come together in the church...</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 20: When ye come together therefore into one place...</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then verses 33 and 34: Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together...that ye come not together unto condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Five times in this one chapter meeting together has been mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Finally let us read chapter sixteen, verse 14, Let all your things be done in love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And then verse 18, For they have refreshed my spirit and yours.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>CHAPTER BY CHAPTER REVIEW</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By picking up all these verses we get a full scope of the thought of the writer in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot just take a few verses from chapter twelve or fourteen and isolate them from the context of the whole book.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As I have already indicated, 1 Corinthians tells us clearly that God s intention is to put us into Christ and make Christ everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have seen in chapter one that Christ to us is the power and wisdom of God v. 24 ; and of God are we in Christ Jesus, who is made unto us wisdom righteousness, sanctification and redemption v. 30 . Then he goes on to tell us that this Christ who is the last Adam has been made a life-giving Spirit 15:45 . Now all that He is to us must be realized, must be experienced not by any other organ of our being but the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, chapter two tells us what kind of person can apprehend Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not a soulish person, but a spiritual one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>14, 15 one who lives and acts in the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Following chapter two, the Apostle Paul tells the Corinthians, You are not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Though you have many gifts, I cannot say that you are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You are still in the flesh, even worse than in the soul 3:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In chapter four he asks if they want him to come to them with a rod or with love and a meek spirit v. 21 . By this he tells the Corinthians that although they are not spiritual, yet he is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are not acting in the spirit, yet he must act in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In chapter five he tells them, Do not think that I am away from you; I am still with you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be absent in my body means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am present with you in my spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>3, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we would be a right person and meet together in the right way, we must be this kind of person, like the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are people like the Corinthians, whatever way we meet will be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are carnal, if we are fleshly, regardless of how we meet, we are utterly wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To meet in the right way, we must be the right person, and the right person is one who lives, walks, and has his being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In chapter six we are told that the Holy Spirit of God dwells in us v. 19 and that he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit v. 17 . Then we have chapter seven, which as we have seen, is so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not think that one who is walking, living, moving and having his being in the spirit is so sure that he is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In chapter eight, we have these verses: verse 1 tells us that knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then another verse tells us that we must take care of others conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not spoil, damage, or weaken the spirit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Chapter nine tells us that what he has sown as a spiritual thing is Christ v. 11 . And chapter ten tells us that Christ is the spiritual rock, not only following us, but also within us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is also the spiritual meat and the spiritual drink vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>3, 4 praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In chapter eleven we see that when we are not meeting in the spirit, we are meeting not for a profit but for a loss v. 17 . Then from chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen, we have seen that the two main things we need are love and prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Love is the life, and prophecy is the function.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Finally in chapter fifteen we are told that this Christ who is our love and our life, our prophecy and our function, is the life-giving Spirit v. 45 . And in chapter sixteen Paul said that the brothers have refreshed his spirit and the spirit of others v. 18 . He said, Let all your things be done in love, and, My love be with you all in Christ Jesus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>14, 24 .</S>
