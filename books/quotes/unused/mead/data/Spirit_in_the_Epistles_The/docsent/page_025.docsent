   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN PHILIPPIANS AND COLOSSIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For to me, to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Phil 1:19-21a</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this portion of the Word, the fact that Christ will be magnified as always whether through life or through death is mentioned together with the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This proves that the supply of the Spirit is absolutely related to the magnification of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not that I speak according to lack, for I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>4:11-13</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The apostle was content in whatever circumstances he was because he had learned the secret of doing all things "by depending on" Christ who strengthened him Chinese Union Version .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Greek, by depending on should be rendered in. The apostle was able to do all things in the One who empowered him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a great difference between these two translations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, when we ride on a boat, strictly speaking, we are in the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we board a boat, we get into the boat and sail by staying in the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can walk, eat, sleep, play, and work in the boat without affecting its ability to sail on.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is what it means to be in the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In contrast, to depend on or hang on to the boat, I have to use my strength.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is dependable if I have the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if I let go because I have no more strength, then it is no longer dependable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please remember that our dependence on the Lord is not outward but inward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since you are in Him, whether or not you depend on Him, you are already in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as you are in Him, you have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was Paul's secret.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1:27</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2:1</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3:3 PHILIPPIANS THE EXPERIENCING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book of Philippians has a special position in the Bible, which is to show us how to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to see that these three small books, Galatians, Ephesians, and Philippians, are connected.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After them, there is the book of Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, there is a total of four short books.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fact that these four books were put together is very meaningful, and I believe that their sequence is the arrangement of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Galatians tells us that Christ is our life, Christ is revealed in us, Christ lives in us, and Christ is being formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to live in Christ, who is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After Galatians, there is Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we truly live by Christ and take Christ as our life, the church immediately emerges.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ as life produces the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, Galatians is on Christ as life, whereas Ephesians is on the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At this point it seems that everything is complete, so why do we still need Philippians?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Please remember that Galatians merely speaks about Christ as life, but it does not show us how to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, after Ephesians, there is another book, Philippians, which shows us how to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Philippians has four chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Chapter one shows us Christ as our manifestation; chapter two, Christ as our pattern; chapter three, Christ as our goal; and chapter four, Christ as our power.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may write in your Bible: manifestation, pattern, goal, and power or strength.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After Philippians, the book of Colossians shows us that the One who is the Head is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is God's centrality and universality, He has the preeminence in all things, and He is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This reaches the pinnacle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, when you view these four books together, they are very meaningful.</S>
