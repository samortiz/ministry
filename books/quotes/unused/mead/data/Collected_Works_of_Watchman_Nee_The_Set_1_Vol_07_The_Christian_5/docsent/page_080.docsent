   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWELVE BASKETS FULL 3 Issue No. 5 A CERTAIN DAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How anxious I am today!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Seemingly, I have lost something!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I surely would like to leave this place to meet with some saints to soothe my loneliness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A day like this is hard to endure!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be here confined alone is really not easy!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is an occasional activity of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the provoking of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>O Lord, I dare not move one step; for I know that Your Spirit works in my heart to divide my soul from my spirit, so that my spirit can ascend to heaven and so that I can be one spirit with the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, and not be affected by the provocation of my soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How unbearable, truly unbearable!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I can endure this unbearableness and not try to escape from the route that the Lord has chosen for me, the soul will lose its power of influence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May the Lord cause me to be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>January 2</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>NEVER THIRST AGAIN</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Lord, who is worthy of our praises forever, was on the earth, He told us, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever" John 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, for what the Lord bestowed upon us can satisfy us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord knows the nature of His own gift.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But what a pity that many times in our experiences we are not like this!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times we are thirsty again!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do we not have this sense of dryness often?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We often feel dissatisfied and even feel the presence of much need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the word of our beloved Lord will never return void.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever He says is true.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The problem is on our side, because we do not believe!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we believe His word, we will surely not thirst again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The living water He promised will constantly supply our parched soul and spirit, and it will satisfy all our desires.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more we believe the Lord's promise, the more the life will "flow."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Oh, how disgusting is this evil heart of unbelief!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May the Lord give us grace that we may believe in Him and rest in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Blessed are those who know that the Lord can satisfy our heart!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Blessed are those who have no thirst other than the thirst for the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>REST</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have only one resting place and that is our Lord "Rest in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we rest in our environment, knowledge, perception, health, or spiritual experience, we will find that they will change and will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are shaky foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thank the Lord that He is our resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we cannot rest on anything else, we can rest in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is our high tower with a firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because of His great love, we rest in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This love is "eternal" and "unto the end."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This love caused our Lord Jesus Christ to come down from heaven to die for us on the cross, to resurrect and ascend, to intercede for us, and to prepare a place for us, and it will cause Him to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How marvelous this love is!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The human tongue and reasonings fail to depict this love of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since we have such a loving God, why is it we cannot stop worrying and simply rest in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nothing that comes along should make us anxious or worried.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should calm down and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, we rest in Him because of His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His wisdom will not let Him miscalculate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He knows how to arrange and how to proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything that comes to us has gone through His wise consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He knows how to cause all things to work together for good to those who love God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although we may think that we are in despair and have no way to go on, and although our hearts are troubled, yet He is not like us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He knows how to uphold the whole universe, and He also knows how to arrange the smallest things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So why do we worry?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Does He not have wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moreover, we rest in Him because of His mighty power.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His arm will never fail, and the greatness of His power is inconceivable.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever things He knows that He should do, He is able also to accomplish them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is able to save His children.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is able to destroy Satan's work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is forever victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is this power that is working for us!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, trembling and feeble brothers, we can be bold.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Recline and rest in the Lord, because this mighty Lord is our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May the Lord give us rest and free us from anxiety in times of difficulty through looking up to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May we believe His love, wisdom, and power, and may we not cause any useless confusion.</S>
