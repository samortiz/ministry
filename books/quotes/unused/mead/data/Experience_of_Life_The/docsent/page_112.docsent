   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TESTING OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit is not only given to deal with us or to break us, but also to test us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people have been in painful trials, but after a certain period their sufferings have passed away and their life has become easy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no criticism given them, but praise; no suppression, but exaltation; everything goes well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a prosperous environment tests where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the discipline of the Holy Spirit consists not only of trials of sufferings, but also of tests of prosperity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some brothers and sisters can endure the trials of poverty, but cannot pass the tests of being rich.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some can endure criticism and attack, but cannot pass the test of being praised or exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some who have never been exposed to riches claim that they do not love money.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That is not dependable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not until gold and silver are within their grasp will it be proved whether they really love money or not.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some say that they would love their wife, but that is because they do not have a wife; once they have a wife for them to love, it will be proved whether they love or not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to expose our inner condition we need the Holy Spirit not only to use a trial through a painful environment, but we often need the Holy Spirit to put us in a favorable environment to test us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the discipline of the Holy Spirit works through both trials and tests simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But normally, the discipline of the Holy Spirit through trials by suffering is always more frequent than through tests of prosperity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>X. A FINAL WORD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit is an important lesson to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many positive lessons for the saints, but this is the only negative one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although there are other lessons of dealings which have to do with the negative aspects, yet all these require the coordination of the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The forefathers in the Bible and all the overcomers in the way of life as recorded in church history have had rich and definite experiences along this line.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although they did not necessarily use this term, the discipline of the Holy Spirit, yet it is abundantly evident that they experienced various environments confronting them as trials and tests.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Apostle Paul in Philippians chapter 4 tells us that he knew how to be abased and how to abound; this is because he learned the lessons of the discipline of the Holy Spirit amidst all circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Much more should we who seek the growth of life pay full attention to this lesson, not only to know the points fully, but to accept the dealings thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we will allow the hand of the Potter to mold and shape us, the pieces of clay, that we may become a fit vessel, filled with the glorious image of His Son.</S>
