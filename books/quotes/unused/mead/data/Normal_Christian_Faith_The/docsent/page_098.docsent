   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONLY GOD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God Himself is the only able One.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The commandments of Christ can only be fulfilled by Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Neither you nor I can do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the answer to our second question is that only the Son of God can fulfill the requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All of us are unable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God alone is able.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, whenever a brother in the Lord tells me that he is hopeless, that he falls as soon as he rises, and that the more he tries the more he fails, I rejoice greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more he weeps for his transgressions and failures, the more I laugh inside.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I will say, "Today you know that you are a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is something to be congratulated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although you should have known this earlier, it is not too late to know it now."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot obey God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's will can only be done by God Himself, and the commandments of Christ can be fulfilled by none other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE GLAD TIDINGS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our gospel is also called the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why is it called the glad tidings?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is it because the Bible contains commandments that have a higher standard than all other religions?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If so, then we are preaching grievous tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a physical fitness test, if the requirement is only to jump a foot, everyone can easily pass.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if the requirement is ten feet, then we have a grievous tiding.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the glad tiding that God gave us?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the bestowing of His Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By His resurrection we are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now He is living inside of us to be our life, so that we may live Him out and fulfill His demands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the glad tiding.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The glad tiding is that God is fulfilling His own commandments inside of us!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The gospel is not a set of do's and don'ts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You do not have to crawl around the earth day and night like crabgrass, telling yourself over and over again that you are not supposed to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not a glad tiding.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a grievous tiding.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The gospel is that God is coming into us to live and obey for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>HE MAKES US ABLE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only do we have to see that we are unable; we have to realize that God is able!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Luke 18:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The young ruler only saw that he was unable and concluded that God was the same and proceeded to leave sorrowfully.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But God is able!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not think that when you are unable everything is over with you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The inability of man is the beginning of the ability of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is the time for God to show forth His power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Not that we are able, but His doing a work for us makes us able.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The meaning of Christ being our life is this: formerly man lived by his own life, but the natural life is ousted by the coming in of the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The "I" who formerly lived is gone, and the life of Christ comes in to take its place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then it is no longer I who live.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the life within is exchanged, the behavior without cannot remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because our life is Christ, we can fulfill Christ's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not the power of Christ helping us to conform to His ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, it is the life of Christ substituting ours to live out His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When His life inside is working, we can keep His laws.</S>
