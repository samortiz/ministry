[1]  Since the Lord began His recovery among us over sixty years ago, we have been seeking to find out what is the right way and the proper way for the believers in Christ to meet.
[2]  The God-ordained way lasted a very short time.
[3]  Christianity s way to meet is according to the natural concept.
[4]  In human history you could see this kind of congregation.
[5]  In the coming messages, my burden is to share with you how to have the home meetings, how to make them rich, strong, fresh, living, so attractive, even so attracting, and able to uphold people.
[6]  According to our study, experience, and observation, I would say that we have found that the home meetings are the unique way for the increase and building up of the church.
[7]  Do not say that you are weak, that you cannot overcome your self, that you cannot overcome your temper, that you cannot control yourself, that you cannot do this or that.
[8]  I have seen in many cases that when you set up a meeting in your home the Holy Spirit brings people to you.
[9]  I would say that if you are a Christian, yet you do not have a home meeting, you are not up to the standard.
[10]  You may know the Bible, be spiritual, be seeking, love the Lord, and so forth, but if you do not open your home, you are not up to the standard.
[11]  You do not need to wait, and you do not need to turn your jaw, and you do not need to turn your tongue; you just need to pray from within your spirit.
[12]  When you do this, you have the sense that deep within you, that is, in your spirit, you are touching the Lord, you are touching the Spirit.
[13]  The Christian meeting is altogether a matter of our spirit.
[14]  First, if you are going to get yourself equipped so that you may be used by the Lord to bless the home meetings, you have to be filled in your spirit.
[15]  Give thanks not only at the time you gain some profit, but also at the time when you suffer a loss; not only at the time when your wife gives you a happy face, but also when she gives you a long face.
[16]  Second, to be equipped for the home meetings, we must be strengthened into our inner man.
[17]  God would strengthen you into the inner man, not according to the scarcity of His strength, but according to the riches of His glory with power through the Holy Spirit.
[18]  After being strengthened into our inner man, verses 17-19 continue, That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, having been rooted and grounded in love, may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[19]  In the last message we saw that the way to be equipped for the home meetings is to be filled in spirit and to be strengthened into the inner man.
[20]  In this message we shall consider two more aspects of the way to be equipped: to experience the unsearchable riches of Christ and to preach Christ as the good news.
[21]  I would like to impress you that Paul in Ephesians 3:8 says that the unsearchable riches of Christ have been shown to him.
[22]  When I was young and read this, I would say, I am not that me.
[23]  I must tell you the truth, every time I am going to speak, my prayer is, Lord, make it so real in the speaking that I am one spirit with You.
[24]  If the Lord is not the Spirit, how could we be one spirit with Him?
[25]  If we are going to enjoy Christ, to experience Christ, first of all we have to realize that this Christ today is the anointed One, full of the Spirit, and that we are joined to Him as one spirit.
[26]  Prior to the day we heard the gospel and were inspired to believe in the Lord Jesus, we did whatever we desired by ourselves.
[27]  TO PRACTICE THE HOME MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 5:42; 1 Cor 12:1-3, 7-10; 14:1, 3, 4b, 12, 19, 23-26, 31; 2 Cor 4:10-14
[28]  In this message we shall consider the way to practice the home meetings.
[29]  First Corinthians 12:1 says, Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.
[30]  Verse 2 continues, You know that when you were of the nations, the Gentiles, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led.
[31]  Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.
[32]  Now from verse 3 we go to verse 7: But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.
[33]  To one through the Spirit is given a word of wisdom... v. 8 . The number one manifestation of the Spirit is in the word of wisdom, not in miracles, not in healings, nor in tongue-speaking.
[34]  But if you read 1 Corinthians 14, you can understand that the word prophesy in this chapter does not refer mainly to foretelling, but rather to speaking forth Christ and to speaking for Christ.
[35]  The most important thing in a Christian meeting is not tongue-speaking; it is the speaking of the word of wisdom, the speaking of the word of knowledge, the speaking of a teaching, and the speaking of a revelation that can reveal something, that can instruct people, and that can build up the saints and the church.
[36]  For the home meetings we need mutuality and speaking for the building up.
[37]  But many of you will say, Brother Lee, we just don t have the gift of speaking.
[38]  Thank the Lord that He has given you such a gift that you can speak for many hours at a time.
[39]  TO SPEAK IN THE HOME MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Num 11:29; 1 Cor 12:13; 14:1, 31; Col 3:16; 1 Tim 6:3
[40]  In the previous message we saw that in order to practice the home meetings, mutuality and speaking must be stressed very much.
[41]  In your speaking you not only speak for God, but also in this kind of divine speaking you speak God forth into others.
[42]  Not just in our meetings, but even in our daily life, we must be people all the time speaking Christ, all the time speaking for Christ, and all the time speaking forth Christ.
[43]  If I come to you and do not speak a bit of Christ, but instead just talk with you about schools, about the world situation, about Taiwan, about Hong Kong, about your city, and this and that, I am doing what the worldly people do.
[44]  Whenever and wherever we open up our mouths, we speak Christ, we speak for Christ, and we speak forth Christ.
[45]  In Acts 1:8 the Lord Jesus told us clearly that we all are His witnesses: But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses.
[46]  According to the principle revealed in the Scriptures, to speak God, to speak forth Christ, and to speak for Christ, surely we need the Spirit.
[47]  Without the Spirit, we would not speak, and even if we would speak, we would feel shameful.
[48]  When you talk about science, geography, history, or the political situation, the more you talk, the more you feel quite proud.
[49]  But when we are filled with the Spirit, we become crazy; we like to speak things concerning Christ to people.
[50]  There was no resurrection of Christ and no ascension, so there was no breathing of the processed life-giving Spirit into God s people, and there was no outpouring of the processed Triune Spirit upon God s people.
[51]  Now you all have to practice the same thing.
[52]  In the home meetings you all have to learn to speak by faith.
[53]  This spirit is not merely our spirit nor merely the Holy Spirit, but is altogether a mingled spirit.
[54]  We know today that we have a mingled spirit within us, the Holy Spirit mingling with our spirit.
[55]  Even at home when you talk to your family concerning Christ, you have to exercise your faith, and you have to exercise your spirit.
[56]  You may have the faith, you may have the spirit, and you may have the Holy Spirit as well, but when you try to speak, you feel you have nothing to speak about.
[57]  Of course, you say you are short of experiences.
[58]  That is right, but I would say you are short not only of experiences but also of the word of Christ.
[59]  You have to notice that in this verse Paul says, Let the word of Christ dwell in you.
[60]  This kind of tone indicates that the word of Christ is here waiting for you to let it come into you.
[61]  God is Christ, Christ is the Spirit, the Spirit is the Word, and the Word is God, Christ, and the Spirit.
[62]  But I assure you, if you are such a person to exercise speaking by faith with the spirit and with the Holy Spirit, spontaneously you will experience Christ.
[63]  You will experience Christ all day long, not only in big things, but especially in all the small things: how to comb your hair, how to dress yourself, how to put on your shoes, what kind of shoes you should buy, and what color you should select.
[64]  Then you will have an accumulation of the rich experience of Christ in you, and whenever you come to the meeting you are used to speaking and you just speak.
[65]  You speak Christ, you speak for Christ, and you speak forth Christ with the living Word.
[66]  CHAPTER SIX SPEAKING IN THE WAY OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 3:16; John 6:63b; 1 Tim 6:3; 3:2; 5:17 THE SHORTAGE OF BUILDING AND LIGHT
[67]  The subject of this message is quite simple speaking in the way of life yet I do have a heavy burden.
[68]  We have printed thousands of pages of the truth and most of you have bought these pages and put them on your shelves.
[69]  We all know the terms and the subject areas, but we just do not know how to present them, how to teach them to people.
[70]  If you open a life-study to any line, you will get the benefit, but I would rather propose to you that you read the life-study consecutively.
[71]  When you speak, when you teach the healthy words of the Lord Jesus, you must exercise yourself to such an extent that people can see God manifested in you.
[72]  FOR FOUR THINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 4:31; 8:4; 6:7; 12:24; 19:20; 1 Cor 1:18; 12:8; 2 Tim 4:2; 2 Thes 3:1; Col 4:3
[73]  In this message my burden is just to exhort you to learn to speak the living and rich word of God.
[74]  If you read through the verses listed above you could see that each verse speaks about the word of God.
[75]  When you put all the points together, you could see that the spoken word is something living.
[76]  We have to thank the Lord that on this earth, two great gifts have been given to humankind and to God s chosen people.
[77]  When you come to the meeting with a deposit of the living and rich word, surely the Spirit will distribute to you the deep word of wisdom and the rich word of knowledge.
[78]  Our speaking with prayer, the Spirit, and boldness is for four things.
[79]  You have to believe that when you speak, the Holy Spirit always follows your speaking and honors your speaking, and people will be saved.
[80]  When you speak to your aunt, do not say, You have to believe in the Lord Jesus, otherwise you will go to hell.
[81]  We must speak not only the gospel, but we must also speak the truth, the divine realities in the Bible.
[82]  To speak the truth, you have to know the truth.
[83]  I do believe the reason you have kept attending is because I do not render you some cheap things, some dead things, speaking things in a poor way.
[84]  For example, the book of Galatians is full of riches: But when it pleased God...to reveal His Son in me 1:15-16 ; For I through law have died to law that I might live to God 2:19 ; I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me 2:20 ; until Christ is formed in you 4:19 ; For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation 6:15 .
[85]  In back of you, in front of you, above and below you, there are many riches, but all the riches are not in you.
[86]  If you would do these three things preach the gospel, release the truth, and minister life to others by speaking the living, rich word then when you come to a big meeting or a small meeting you will be so rich.
[87]  Then when you come to the meeting, whether or not you have the feeling that you are inspired or led, you will just speak.
