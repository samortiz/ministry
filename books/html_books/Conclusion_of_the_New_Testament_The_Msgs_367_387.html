OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(73)</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as revealed in Hebrews, one of the greatest books in the New Testament. Every aspect of Christ revealed in this book is significant.</p>
<p>Christ the Son is the center, the focus, of the book of Hebrews. In the Godhead He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of God&rsquo;s substance. In creation He is (1) the means through which the universe was made (1:2); (2) the power that upholds and bears all things (v. 3); and (3) the Heir appointed to inherit all things (v. 2). In redemption He accomplished the purification of man&rsquo;s sins and is now sitting on the right hand of God in the heavens (v. 3).</p>
<p>This book reveals to us the contrast between the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament was of the law in letters and forms, of man, earthly, temporary, and by sight and issued in a religion called Judaism. The New Testament is of life, spiritual, heavenly, permanent, and by faith and is focused in a person who is the Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">94. The Son of God<br />
Being Better Than the Angels</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 1 Christ is revealed as the Son of God, who is superior to the angels. This chapter quotes the prophecies in the Old Testament to tell us that the Son, through whom God speaks, is God Himself (v. 8). The angels, however, are merely the servants of God and even of those who inherit God&rsquo;s salvation (vv. 6-7, 14). Christ as the Son of God is God Himself, and God is certainly superior to the angels. Therefore, Christ is superior to the angels.</p>
<p>Christ is nothing less than God Himself. He is also the appointed Heir of all things and the means through whom the whole universe was created. Furthermore, He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory, the impress of God&rsquo;s substance, and the One who accomplished redemption. Because our Christ is the essence of God, He is superior to and more excellent than the angels.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Creator of the Heavens and the Earth</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:10, a quotation from Psalm 102:25, is applied to Christ and indicates that, as the Son of God, Christ created the heavens and the earth: &ldquo;You in the beginning, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.&rdquo; Christ, the Son of God, is God Himself as well as the Lord; hence, He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>All things came into existence through the Son (John 1:3; Col. 1:16; 1 Cor. 8:6). As the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Christ is the origination and the source of all the created things. His creation of the heavens and of the earth began the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal plan to carry out God&rsquo;s intention to have a full expression in man in the universe.</p>
<p>The angels, which are like winds and flames of fire, are simply creatures, whereas the Son is the Creator. As creatures, the angels are much inferior to the Son, and as the Creator, the Son is much superior to the angels.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Through Him God Making the Universe</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:2 tells us that God made the universe through Christ the Son. The word <em>universe</em> in this verse literally means &ldquo;ages&rdquo;; <em>the ages</em> is a Jewish expression that means &ldquo;the universe.&rdquo; <em>Ages</em> here does not refer to the matter of time but to creation (the universe) unfolded in time through successive ages. Here the universe not only implies time and space; it also means the aggregate of all the ages.</p>
<p>Most Christians know that Christ created the heavens, the earth, and all things. But very few know that after His creation He is still continually forming the ages, age after age. Hence, the universe refers not only to the heavens and the earth but also to all the ages in the heavens and the earth. For example, after the creation of the heavens and the earth, Adam was created; thus, there was the age of Adam with its history. When the age of Adam was over, the age of Noah with its history began. After the age of Noah, the age of Abraham with its history occurred. When the age of Abraham was over, the age of Moses came, at which time the law was decreed. When the age of Moses was over, the age of David came. Then after all the ages of the Old Testament, there was the age of Jesus Christ, the age of the New Testament. These ages did not take place merely by human development or natural evolution; rather, they were founded, instituted, by Christ.</p>
<p>After creating the heavens and the earth, Christ instituted the ages, age after age. If there were only the heavens, the earth, and all things, without the succession of ages, then no events could have happened. Hence, the universe includes not only time and space but also all the events that have happened in time and space. This is the entire history of the human race.</p>
<p>The purpose of Christ&rsquo;s forming the universe is to afford God the opportunity to obtain what He wants. All the events that have happened in time and space&mdash;all the things that have occurred successively in the universe&mdash;have given God the opportunity to capture, save, and gain His chosen people one by one and to gather and blend them together into the one Body of Christ. In other words, the universe, which is composed of all the successive ages in time, provides the opportunity for God to gain what He desires in His economy.</p>
<p>We also need to see that God made the universe through Christ the Creator. This implies the Divine Trinity. Christ the Son created the heavens and the earth, yet through Him God made the universe. Moreover, in Genesis 1:2, the Spirit of God was involved in God&rsquo;s creation of the universe, for the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters in order to generate life. God the Father created the universe in God the Son and by God the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the Bible the trinity of the Godhead implies God&rsquo;s activities for the dispensing of God Himself in His trinity into His chosen and redeemed people. Thus, God&rsquo;s intention in creating the universe is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. God the Father in the Son and through the Spirit needed to make the universe in order to impart Himself in His trinity into us.</p><h2 class="head4">c. The One Who Will Remain Forever</h2>
<p>As the Creator, Christ the Son will remain forever. Although all the created things will change sooner or later, He will last forever, remaining the same. Hebrews 1:11-12 says, &ldquo;They will perish, but You remain perpetually; and they all will become old like a garment, and like a mantle You will roll them up; like a garment they will also be changed; but You are the same, and Your years will not fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verses 10 through 12 reveal that Christ will be superior to the angels in eternity. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;You in the beginning, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.&rdquo; This refers to His creation. Verses 11 and 12 reveal that the old creation will be terminated, that the new heaven and new earth will be ushered in, and that Christ will be the everlasting One in eternity. As the Creator and the everlasting One, He is superior to the angels, His creatures.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Upholder of All Things<br />
by the Word of His Power</h2>
<p>Verse 3 speaks of Christ the Son &ldquo;upholding and bearing all things by the word of His power.&rdquo; This verse indicates that Christ is not only the Creator of all things in the universe but also the Upholder of all things by the word of His power. All things subsist together under His powerful upholding (Col. 1:17).</p>
<p>After creating all things, the Son became the Upholder (Heb. 1:3). The earth is suspended in the air. There are no columns supporting it. After Christ created the earth, He began to uphold it. He upholds it by the word of His power. Christ the Son upholds the universe very easily. He does not do anything&mdash;He just speaks. He upholds all things by the word of His power.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 11:3 we are told that the universe was framed by the word of God, and in 1:3 we see that the universe is upheld by the word of His power. The Son is not only the Creator, but He is also the Upholder. He created and upholds the universe by His word.</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;word&rdquo; in verse 3 denotes the instant word. The Son upholds and bears all things not by His work but by His instant word, the word of His power. In creation all things came into being through Him as the Word (John 1:1-3). The universe has been framed by the word of God (Heb. 11:3): &ldquo;He spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood&rdquo; (Psa. 33:9). In salvation we are saved through His word (John 5:24; Rom. 10:8, 17). It is through His word that His authority with power is exercised (Matt. 8:8-9). It is by His word that His healing power is realized (John 4:50-51). God speaks in the Son, and the Son upholds and bears all things by His word. It is altogether a matter of speaking. When the Lord speaks, everything is in order.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. The Appointed Heir of All Things</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:2 tells us that Christ the Son is the appointed Heir of all things. This means that Christ is the legal Heir, inheriting all things in God&rsquo;s economy. Since Christ is not only the Son of God but also the Heir of God, all that God the Father is and has is His possession (John 16:15). In the past the Son was the Creator (Heb. 1:2, 10; John 1:3; Col. 1:16; 1 Cor. 8:6); in the present He is the Upholder of all things and the One who bears all things (Heb. 1:3); in the future He will be the Heir, inheriting all things (cf. Rom. 11:36). Since Christ created all things, He will inherit what He created. This is the relationship between Christ and creation.</p>
<p>Christ, as typified by Isaac, the son of Abraham, will inherit the earth (Psa. 2:8), the kingdom (Dan. 7:13-14), the throne (Luke 1:32), and all things (Matt. 11:27). Since He is not only the Son of God but also the legal Heir of God, all that God the Father is and has is for His possession (John 16:15).</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. The Effulgence of God&rsquo;s Glory<br />
and the Impress of God&rsquo;s Substance</h2>
<p>We need to also see how Christ is related to the Godhead. Hebrews 1:3 speaks of Christ the Son as the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of His substance. God&rsquo;s glory is God expressed, and God&rsquo;s substance is that which exists intrinsically in His divine being. In the Godhead, Christ is both the effulgence of the expressed God and the image of God&rsquo;s inner being.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Effulgence of God&rsquo;s Glory</h2>
<p>The effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory is like the shining or the brightness of the light of the sun. The Son is the shining, the brightness, of the Father&rsquo;s glory. This refers to God&rsquo;s glory. Separating the effulgence from the glory may be likened to separating the shining of the sun from the rays of the sun. The shining cannot be separated from the rays, for they are one. Likewise, we should never consider the Son as separate from God. The Son is the expression of God Himself; Christ the Son is God expressed. He is nothing less than God; He is God Himself.</p>
<p>Our Christ is God coming to us. He is our God reaching us. Just as the sun can reach us by the shining of its rays, Christ, the Son of God, is God Himself reaching us and coming into us. We have a God who reaches us, a God who comes into us. This is our great salvation (2:3), and this is the Son of God.</p><h2 class="head5">2) The Impress of God&rsquo;s Substance</h2>
<p>The Son is also the impress, the express image, of the substance of God (1:3). The impress of God&rsquo;s substance is like the impress of a seal. The Son is the expression of what God the Father is. God&rsquo;s substance is Spirit (John 4:24), and Christ is the impress of this substance.</p>
<p>The glory is the outward expression, and the substance is the inward essence. God has His essence, His substance, as well as His appearance. God&rsquo;s essence is His substance. He has substance as well as glory. Our God is glorious and substantial. As far as God&rsquo;s glory is concerned, the Son is the effulgence of this glory. As far as God&rsquo;s substance is concerned, the Son is the impress of this substance.</p>
<p>The Son is not only the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory but also the impress of God&rsquo;s substance. This means that the Son is God coming to us. When God does not come to us, He is simply God. When God comes to us, He is the Son as the impress of His substance.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. In Him God Having Spoken to Us<br />
at the Last of These Days</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo; Our God is revealed because He has revealed Himself in His speaking. The living God imparts and infuses Himself into us by speaking (2 Tim. 3:16-17; Ezek. 37:4-6). When God speaks, the light shines, bringing us understanding, vision, knowledge, wisdom, and utterance (Psa. 119:105, 130). When God speaks, life is imparted, and this life includes all the divine attributes and human virtues of Christ (John 6:63; 1:1, 4). When God speaks, power is transmitted, and this is the growing and reproducing power of life.</p>
<p>The whole universe came into being by God&rsquo;s speaking (Rom. 4:17; Heb. 11:3; Psa. 33:9). In the Old Testament, God spoke in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, in men borne by His Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21). Now at the last of these days, that is, in the New Testament age, God has spoken to us in the Son, in the person of the Son. To us, Christ, the Son of God, is the mouthpiece of God, the oracle of God. The Son is God Himself speaking. To say that God has spoken to us in the Son means that God speaks in Himself. God has spoken in the Son, and the Son is God; this indicates that God speaks in Himself. God Himself speaks to us in His divine being, not through some other agent. The Son is God Himself (Heb. 1:8), God expressed. God the Father is hidden; God the Son is expressed. No one has ever seen God; the Son, as the Word of God (John 1:1; Rev. 19:13) and the speaking of God, has declared Him with a full expression, explanation, and definition of Him (John 1:18). God speaking in the Son means that the Son speaks God.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, God speaks in the Son, in the person of the Son. This person was first an individual and then became corporate. God today speaks in a person, and this person has been increased to be a corporate person, including all the apostles and all the members of this person&rsquo;s Body (1 Cor. 14:4b, 31). Because all the members of the Body of Christ are the sons of God in the firstborn Son of God, their speaking for God is also God&rsquo;s speaking in the person of the Son. The firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God are considered as one in the person of the Son. Today God is speaking through a corporate person. Therefore, &ldquo;the Son&rdquo; mentioned in Hebrews 1:2 is corporate.</p>
<p>God is still speaking in the Son, and we believers are a part of the Son. Throughout the past twenty centuries, the speaking of those who spoke forth the Lord according to the New Testament and its principles has been the Son&rsquo;s speaking. In the New Testament the apostle Paul is an example of one whose speaking was the Son&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>God speaks in the sonship. The sonship in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is not only individual but also corporate. Christ is the firstborn Son of God, and we are the many sons of God (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10). God has many sons, and the many sons have been incorporated. The Firstborn plus the many sons are the collective, corporate Son. The entire New Testament is the speaking of the processed God in the person of the Son with all His members. We are the members of the Body of Christ, and the Body is composed of all the sons of God. God begot many children to become His sons, and these sons are the components of the Body of Christ. Therefore, we are the members of the Son. Today God is still speaking in the corporate Son in the principle of incarnation.</p>
<p>God today continues to speak in His Son who has been enlarged to become a corporate man, the Body of Christ. The evil intention of the Jewish religionists was to terminate the Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth, by crucifying Him. But after His crucifixion, the Lord entered into the realm of resurrection, and in resurrection He became the Head of the Body. Before His crucifixion and resurrection, the Lord Jesus was restricted by the flesh; it was not possible for Him to be universal. But through death and resurrection He was enlarged from an individual to a corporate man. On the day of Pentecost Christ came down as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His disciples to make them members of His Body. This Body, a corporate man, includes the resurrected Christ as the Head and the millions of believers in Christ as the members. Now, just as our whole body speaks whenever we speak, so the Body of Christ speaks whenever Christ speaks as the Head. Today the Son of God is no longer merely an individual; He is a corporate, universal man. For this reason, all the members of the Body can speak the word of God.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s having many sons means that there should be &ldquo;many speakings.&rdquo; A son of God should speak for God everywhere. As the sons of God, we all need to be those who speak forth Christ. All the sons in the divine sonship should speak Christ, and Christ speaks for God. In the New Testament God speaks in Christ as His firstborn Son, indicating that all the brothers of His firstborn Son as His many sons, the members of the Body of Christ, should be the word of God, speaking for God.</p>
<p>In the four Gospels the Son came to speak God, not only with clear words but also with what He was and what He did. He is altogether the Word of God and the speaking of God. Sometimes He spoke with words, and other times He spoke with actions. All that He was and all that He did spoke God. &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (John 1:18). The entire four Gospels were His speaking, either by word directly or by what He was. He spoke much by words, but He spoke even more by what He was. Whatever He did, whatever He spoke, whatever He worked, and however He behaved was altogether His speaking.</p>
<p>Whenever the Son speaks, He is the Spirit. The speaking Son is the Spirit. The Son of God is the Word. When the Word speaks, it becomes the Spirit, and when the Son speaks, His word is the Spirit (6:63). Eventually, to the churches He is the speaking Spirit. At the beginning of each of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, the Son speaks, but at the end of each epistle, it is the Spirit speaking to the churches. God speaks in the Son, and when the Son speaks to the churches, He is the speaking Spirit. By His speaking, the churches will become one with Him. At the end of Revelation the Spirit and the church speak as one (22:17). God speaks in the Son, the Son becomes the speaking Spirit, and the speaking Spirit is one with the church speaking for God. This is the speaking history of our God, a history that is a speaking story.</p>
<p>This speaking story is recorded in the Bible. The entire Bible is a history of God. This history is a speaking story. When God created all things, He did so by speaking. When He contacted humanity in the Old Testament times, He did it by speaking in the prophets. When He came to mankind in the New Testament age, He spoke in the Son, in the person of the Son as His Word. He comes into the churches today by speaking as the speaking Spirit. By speaking as the Spirit, He makes Himself one with the churches. Eventually, this speaking story consists of not only God Himself but also of all the churches. Meeting after meeting, the church life is a speaking story. We are a speaking people. By this speaking, God is transfused into people. By this speaking, many human beings are being infused and saturated with the divine element. This is the church life. This is God speaking.</p>
<p>The essence of the Epistle to the Hebrews is God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son. God speaks in the Son, the Son speaks as the Spirit to the churches, and ultimately, the Spirit speaks with the church. It is altogether by this speaking story that God is brought into man, and man is brought into God. God and man, man and God, become one. This is the wonderful church life.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(74)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son of God who is better than the angels.</p>
<h2 class="head4">h. Having Made Purification of Sins,<br />
He Having Sat Down on the Right Hand<br />
 of the Majesty on High until God Makes<br />
His Enemies a Footstool for His Feet</h2>
<p>Christ made purification of sins and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high until God makes His enemies a footstool for His feet (Heb. 1:3).</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Having Purified Sins in the Past</h2>
<p>Verse 3 tells us that Christ &ldquo;made purification of sins.&rdquo; In God&rsquo;s redemption there are three time periods. First, the Lord purified our sins in the past. He has not only propitiated for our sins but also made purification of them. <em>Propitiation</em> means &ldquo;covering,&rdquo; but <em>purification</em> means that our sins have been washed away. In the Old Testament type the propitiation was able only to cover sins (Psa. 32:1); it was unable to take away sins. So the propitiating priests stood daily, offering the same sacrifices (Heb. 10:11), and could never sit down. But the Son took away sin (John 1:29) and accomplished the purification of sins once for all; hence, He sat down forever (Heb. 10:10, 12). In the eyes of God, sin is over, and throughout the whole universe sin has been washed away. Sin should not be in us, in the church, or in our home. Sin has been washed away, and the purification of sins has been accomplished. The Son completed this work in the past.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Sitting at the Right Hand of God<br />
in the Present</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:3 goes on to say that Christ &ldquo;sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.&rdquo; This clearly refers to the ascension. In His ascension Christ, as the ascended Son of God, is much superior to the angels. He is no longer in the tomb or on the earth; He is at the right hand of the Majesty on high. This is His ascension in which He was inaugurated into His office to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, that is, to build up the church and to bring His many brothers into glory (2:10).</p>
<p>The Son is now sitting, resting. He is sitting on the right hand of God, watching His lovers and seekers experience His purification of sins. At least five times the book of Hebrews tells us that the Lord Jesus is sitting (1:3, 13; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2). Regarding redemption, He has no work to do. He does not need to wash us again, for He has thoroughly washed us already. Before we even made our confession, He had already washed us. In fact, we were washed before we were born. The Lord has finished all the work of redemption (9:12).</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) Waiting for the Subduing of the Enemies<br />
in the Future</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:13 says, &ldquo;To which of the angels has He ever said, &lsquo;Sit at My right hand until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet&rsquo;?&rdquo; Christ the Son is waiting for His enemies to be subdued. This will occur in the future. The Lord lacks nothing except a footstool. He has the throne and the crown, but He does not yet have the footstool. Be assured that one day He will obtain this footstool. Christ is sitting at the right hand of God until God makes all His enemies and adversaries serve Christ as a footstool for His rest. Now we are still in the period of &ldquo;until,&rdquo; the period of the church. We are still in the time when God is working to bring all His enemies under the feet of Christ.</p>
<p>The book of Hebrews stresses the fact that Christ has accomplished everything for God and us, leaving nothing for us to do. His sitting at the right hand of God signifies that His work has been accomplished and that He is resting there, waiting for only one thing&mdash;that God will make His enemies a footstool for His feet. He is sitting there in the heavens waiting for a footstool that He may have complete rest.</p>
<h2 class="head4">i. Being Begotten to Be the Firstborn Son of God<br />
and Coming Back as God&rsquo;s Firstborn</h2>
<p>It is also in resurrection that Christ is declared to be the Son of God who is superior to the angels. Resurrection means a new beginning; it denotes germination. Verse 3 refers to His death by saying, &ldquo;Having made purification of sins.&rdquo; Verse 5 indicates His resurrection by which He was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God (Acts 13:33) as the beginning of a new age, the age of the church, which is composed of His many brothers born of God through His resurrection.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s economy, God has the firstborn Son and the many sons. Before Christ was incarnated, God had only one, unique Son. In the Bible this Son is called the only Begotten (John 1:14, 18). John 3:16, a verse familiar to every Christian, says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. God&rsquo;s only begotten Son was Christ. Before His death and resurrection, Christ was the unique Son of God. The New Testament reveals that through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection the many sons of God were born (1 Pet. 1:3). Early in the morning of the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus said to Mary, &ldquo;Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God&rdquo; (John 20:17). He never called His disciples brothers before that morning. Even in John 15 He said, &ldquo;No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends&rdquo; (v. 15). The most intimate term He used regarding His disciples before His resurrection was <em>friends.</em> But after His resurrection, He met one of His female disciples and told her to go to His brothers. This was prophesied in Psalm 22. The first words of this psalm, &ldquo;My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?&rdquo; were spoken by the Lord when He was on the cross (Matt. 27:46). The first twenty-one verses of Psalm 22 speak of the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion. Suddenly, verse 22 says, &ldquo;I will declare Your name to my brothers.&rdquo; This proves that He passed through death and entered into resurrection. After He passed through death and resurrection, the many brothers were produced. He was that one grain of wheat, which through death and resurrection became many grains (John 12:24). Now God has many sons. He not only has the only begotten Son but also the many sons with the Firstborn. Before His resurrection Christ was the only begotten Son of God. After His resurrection, since the many sons of God have been produced, He became God&rsquo;s firstborn Son with many brothers.</p>
<p>Before Jesus Christ was resurrected, God did not have a firstborn Son. He just had the only begotten Son. What is the difference between the firstborn Son and the only begotten Son? As the only begotten Son, Christ did not have the human nature. He had only the divine nature. When He was incarnated, He put on human nature. The thirty-three and a half years of His life on earth were a transitory state. On the one hand, He was still the only begotten Son of God; on the other hand, He had put on human nature. The divine nature within Him was the Son of God but the human nature was not. Therefore, during those thirty-three and a half years, Jesus was quite peculiar. He had the divine nature&mdash;that was the Son of God&mdash;but He also put on the human nature&mdash;that was not the Son of God. That human nature had not been born of God. According to His divinity, His divine nature, He was the Son of God. But before His resurrection, He had something that was not born of God&mdash;the human nature. He needed to pass through death and resurrection in order for that human part to be born of God. Psalm 2:7 is a strong basis for this: &ldquo;You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You.&rdquo; What was prophesied in Psalm 2:7 was fulfilled on the day of resurrection. This is indicated by Acts 13:33 which, referring to the resurrection of Christ, quotes this verse from Psalm 2. In His human nature Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of resurrection. After this, He became the firstborn Son of God. Now, as the firstborn Son, He has both the divine nature and the human nature. As the only begotten Son of God, He did not have the human nature. While He was on earth after His incarnation, He had the human nature, but in those thirty-three and a half years His human nature had not been born of God. It was through His resurrection that the human part of His being was born of God. By this begetting, He became the firstborn Son of God. While the only begotten Son of God had only the divine nature and not the human nature, Jesus today as the firstborn Son of God has both natures. The firstborn Son of God is not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man.</p>
<p>As the Son of God, He is superior to the angels in His second coming. Hebrews 1:6 alludes to this. &ldquo;When He brings again the Firstborn into the inhabited earth, He says, &lsquo;And let all the angels of God worship Him.&rsquo;&rdquo; We know that this verse refers to the second coming because it speaks of Christ as the Firstborn. In His first coming, He was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son (John 1:14). As the only begotten Son of God, Christ possessed divinity but not humanity. In incarnation, however, Christ as the only begotten Son of God became the Son of Man, and in resurrection He was born in His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God. Therefore, when Christ returns, He will not come in the same status that He had when He came to the earth the first time. Christ came to the earth the first time as the only begotten Son of God, but He will come the second time as the firstborn Son of God, the Son of God possessing both divinity and humanity.</p>
<p>In other words, when God brought Christ to earth the first time, He came in His status as the only begotten Son of God. In such a status, He became the Son of Man in His incarnation, and as the Son of Man He was begotten to be the Son of God in His resurrection. Hence, when God brings Him to the inhabited earth the second time, He will come in His status as the firstborn Son of God, a status in which He is both the Son of God and the Son of Man. For this reason, He declared to the Jewish opposers in Matthew 26 that they would see Him coming back as the Son of Man on the clouds of heaven (v. 64). When God brings Christ again into the inhabited earth as the Firstborn, all the angels will worship Him.</p><h2 class="head4">j. Having Inherited a More Distinguished Name<br />
Than the Angels</h2>
<p>The Son has a more excellent name than the angels. Hebrews 1:4 speaks of Christ &ldquo;having become as much better than the angels as to have inherited a more distinguished name than they.&rdquo; This more distinguished name is the Son, which is fully defined in the succeeding verses of this chapter: &ldquo;For to which of the angels has He ever said, &lsquo;You are My Son; this day have I begotten You&rsquo;? And again, &lsquo;I will be a Father to Him, and He will be a Son to Me&rsquo;?&rdquo; (v. 5). Romans 1:4 says that Christ &ldquo;was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.&rdquo; His coming out of death was the designation that He is the Son of God. Christ has been designated as and declared to be the Son of God. He has received such an excellent name. Regrettably, some Christians seem to love the angels more than Christ, but we need to see that Christ has inherited a more distinguished name&mdash;the name of the Son of God&mdash;than they.</p>
<h2 class="head4">k. His God Having Anointed Him<br />
with the Oil of Exultant Joy above His Partners</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1:9, which is addressed to Christ the Son says, &ldquo;You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners.&rdquo; The expression <em>Your God</em> seems to mean &ldquo;God&rsquo;s God.&rdquo; Christ the Son is God, yet God is His God. How can we explain this? Since the Son is also man, God is His God.</p>
<p>Verse 9 indicates that God the Father has anointed God the Son with God the Spirit as the oil of exultant joy. In God&rsquo;s economy Christ is the One appointed by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan, and we are Christ&rsquo;s partners in the divine interest. He was anointed by God, and we share with Him this anointing for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. In a sense, Christ is the greatest businessman in the universe; He is carrying out a divine enterprise, a divine career, for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy (cf. Luke 19:13). We should remember our status as Christ&rsquo;s partners and declare that we are partners of Christ in His great enterprise.</p>
<p>Christ was appointed in eternity past and anointed in time (Heb. 1:9). That anointing was the initial heavenly, divine inauguration. God initially inaugurated His appointed Heir into office by anointing Him. God the Spirit poured Himself out as the anointing oil upon this appointed Heir, anointing Him to be the operator of God&rsquo;s divine operation.</p>
<p>As the partners of Christ, we are partners in His anointing. His anointing includes us. In Psalm 133 we see that the ointment poured out upon the head of Aaron, the high priest, flows down upon the whole body to the hem of his garments. This signifies that all the members of the Body of the High Priest share His anointing. We, the partners, share the anointing of the unique Heir. The anointing was the initial inauguration. Therefore, we all share in His inauguration. In this heavenly, divine, and eternal inauguration, we are His partners. He has obtained the anointing, and we share it with Him because we are His partners. This means that we all have been anointed. We all have been put into office. We are not only the partakers of Christ who enjoy Him but also the partners of Christ who share in His operation. He will accomplish a full expression of God in glory, and we are now cooperating with Him in this operation. We are Christ&rsquo;s joint-heirs and partners, cooperating with Him and sharing in His operation. His office must also be our office.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 1:9 we see our relationship with God&rsquo;s anointed One. In God&rsquo;s economy, Christ is the Heir appointed by God, and in verse 9 we see that this appointed Heir has been anointed. The anointing confirms the appointment. God first appointed the Son and then anointed Him. As Christ&rsquo;s partners, we all partake of His anointing. We need to see that we are partners of Christ and that we share in His anointing.</p>
<h2 class="head4">l. Being God Whose Throne Is Forever and Ever,<br />
and the Scepter of Uprightness<br />
Being the Scepter of His Kingdom</h2>
<p>The second coming of Christ is followed by His kingdom. He, as the coming firstborn Son of God, will be superior to the angels in His kingdom. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Of the Son, &lsquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.&rsquo;&rdquo; Here the Son is addressed, &ldquo;O God.&rdquo; This is strong proof that the Son is God. Surely God is superior to the angels. This verse also indicates that the throne of the Son is the everlasting throne of God. Thus, His kingdom must also be the kingdom of God. Christ, the Son of God, has the throne of God and the kingdom of God. The throne is under Him, and the scepter of the kingdom, which signifies the authority of the kingdom, is in His hand. As the Son of God who possesses both the throne and the kingdom of God, Christ is much superior to the angels.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1 gives us an account of Christ from eternity past to eternity future. He was the very God in eternity past (v. 8); He was the Creator of the earth and the heavens (vv. 10, 2); He is the Upholder of all things and the One who bears all things (v. 3); He is the Heir of all things (v. 2); He was incarnated for redemption by being crucified (v. 3); He was begotten as the Son of God in resurrection for the imparting of life to the many sons of God (v. 5); He is the firstborn Son of God who will come again (v. 6); He will be the King on the throne with the scepter in the kingdom (vv. 8-9); and He will remain forever and ever in eternity future (vv. 11-12). This short chapter covers such a wide span of what Christ is from eternity past to eternity future. This is our Christ, the Son of God who is superior to the angels!</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">95. The Son of Man Becoming<br />
Better Than the Angels</h2>
<p>Hebrews 1 reveals Christ as the Son of God being much better than the angels, whereas chapter 2 reveals Christ as the Son of Man becoming better than the angels. Our wonderful Jesus has two natures, divine and human. He has divinity and humanity. He is God, and He is man. Since He is God, He is the Son of God. Since He is man, He is the Son of Man. According to biblical usage, <em>man</em> and <em>Son of Man</em> are interchangeable terms. This is proved by Psalm 8:4 which says, &ldquo;What is mortal man, that You remember him, / And the son of man, that You visit him?&rdquo; Hence, <em>the Son of Man</em> simply means &ldquo;man.&rdquo; In the same principle, <em>the Son of God</em> means &ldquo;God.&rdquo; According to John 5:17-18, for Jesus to be the Son of God means that He is God. When the Pharisees heard that the Lord Jesus called Himself the Son of God, they accused Him of blasphemy because, in their understanding, He made Himself equal with God. Thus, to say that Jesus is the Son of God means that He is God. Christ is both God and man. Hebrews 1 covers His divinity and chapter 2 covers His humanity. With respect to both His divinity and humanity, He is superior to the angels. Even as the Son of Man, He is superior to the angels.</p>
<p>Although it is easy to realize that God is absolutely superior to the angels, it is difficult for us to realize that man is also superior to them. According to 1:14, as the heirs of salvation, we are much superior to the angels, for the angels are our servants, and we are their masters. We are the partners of Christ, and the angels are the servants, ministering to the heirs of salvation. We are the house of God, in which the heavenly ladder joins us to God and brings God to us, while the angels are ministering spirits ascending and descending upon this ladder as they render their service to us. Hence, they are much inferior to us. Matthew 18:10 reveals that every one of us has an angel. Psalm 34:7 says, &ldquo;The angel of Jehovah encamps / Around those who fear Him, and He delivers them.&rdquo; An angel appeared to Cornelius (Acts 10:3), telling him where to contact the one who preached the gospel. Moreover, Acts 12:7-11 tells us how an angel opened the door of the prison that Peter might escape.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2:5 says, &ldquo;It was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak.&rdquo; The &ldquo;coming inhabited earth&rdquo; will be this earth in the coming age with God&rsquo;s kingdom. Psalm 2:8 says that God has given to Christ the nations to be His inheritance and the limits of the earth as His possession. Revelation 11:15 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.&rdquo; The day is coming when the nations, the kingdoms, of the earth will become the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;coming inhabited earth&rdquo; in the coming age is not subjected to angels. In other words, God never ordained the angels, but instead ordained man, to rule over the earth in the coming age. Based upon this fact, the writer of Hebrews shows us that man is superior to the angels.</p>
<p>In His economy, God intended from the beginning that man should rule over the earth. From eternity past, God determined to have man ruling over the earth. According to the Bible, at the time of creation God determined that man should exercise His authority over the earth. This is clearly mentioned in Genesis 1:26-28.</p>
<p>There are three chapters in the Bible that belong together&mdash;Genesis 1, Psalm 8, and Hebrews 2. All of these chapters share one main point&mdash;that God has ordained man to rule over His created earth. God has ordained man to rule over the earth because God needs a realm, a sphere, a dominion, in which He can exercise His authority. Without such a dominion in which He can exercise His authority, it would be difficult for God to express His glory. The expression of His glory needs a dominion. If God has no authority on earth, He cannot express His glory. We should consider the conclusion of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer: &ldquo;For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory&rdquo; (Matt. 6:13). Once there is the kingdom, there is the authority. Then God is able to express His glory. The kingdom is for the authority, and the authority is for the glory. If God has no kingdom, there can be no exercise of His authority and no expression of His glory. The Lord&rsquo;s prayer was for the kingdom. In that kingdom there would be the exercise of authority and the expression of glory.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose is constant and eternal. God&rsquo;s purpose is from eternity to eternity. God has never changed His purpose of having man exercise His authority on earth that He might have a dominion as a sphere in which He can express His glory.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2 reveals that Christ as man is superior to the angels. The writer of Hebrews argues in this way: &ldquo;It was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak&rdquo; (v. 5). However, God did say in Psalm 8 that the time would come when He would subject all creation to man. This man is Jesus (vv. 6-9), the One who brought God into man to uplift man&rsquo;s standard. By His incarnation, He brought the divine nature into man, and by His resurrection, ascension, and glorification, He brought the human nature into God. Therefore, this man is much more excellent than the angels. The angels are nothing more than servants who minister to all the members of this man, to all those who inherit salvation through this man, that is, who inherit this wonderful man as their salvation.</p>
<p>Christ Himself is God, the Son of God; He is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of His substance. He is even called God Himself (1:8). In Him there is the reality of God. As such, He is much superior to the angels. He is also a glorified man with God&rsquo;s divine nature, crowned with glory and honor. As such a man, He is superior to the angels. The angels are merely servants of those who inherit Christ as their salvation.</p><h2 class="head4">a.God Having Set Him over the Works of God&rsquo;s Hands and Having Subjected All Things under His Feet</h2>
<p>Hebrews 2:7-8, which is addressed to God, says, &ldquo;You...have set Him over the works of Your hands; You have subjected all things under His feet.&rdquo; These verses refer to Genesis 1, which tells us that God set Adam, the man created by God, over the works of God&rsquo;s hands (vv. 26-28). This indicates that Adam, as the head of God&rsquo;s creation, was a prefigure of Christ (Rom. 5:14). God&rsquo;s subjecting all things under the feet of Adam typifies God&rsquo;s subjecting all things under the feet of Christ, the reality of Adam as the head of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>In His exaltation, Christ was made Head over all things (Heb 2:8; Eph. 1:22). God has subjected all things under His feet. Now He is waiting for only one thing&mdash;for the subtle Satan and all His enemies to be made His footstool.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. God Making Him a Little Inferior to the Angels because of the Suffering of Death So That<br />
by the Grace of God He Might Taste Death<br />
on Behalf of Everything</h2>
<p>According to Hebrews 2:9, God made Christ a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death &ldquo;so that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything.&rdquo; Man is inferior to the angels in that whereas man is limited and bound in the matter of time and space, the angels are not limited to the same extent but enjoy greater freedom. Christ is the unlimited, eternal, omnipresent Creator; as such, He is not bound by time and space. But when Christ became a man, He was limited in the matter of time. For instance, while He was in Galilee, He could not simultaneously be in Jerusalem; rather, to go to Jerusalem, He had to walk a long distance. While He was with Martha and Mary in Martha&rsquo;s home, He could not be with others who were staying elsewhere at that time. In this sense, even Christ in the days of His flesh was inferior to the angels.</p>
<p>In eternity Christ was the Creator, unlimited omnipresent, but when He became a man in time, He was limited so that one day He could go to the cross to deal with the universal problem&mdash;death. Death is a problem not only to man but also to the entire universe. Death is the last enemy of Christ to be abolished (1 Cor. 15:26). In order to suffer death and thus destroy and nullify death, Christ had to become a man and lose His freedom temporarily, for thirty-three and a half years. In that sense, He was inferior to the angels during that period. However, three days after His death He resurrected out of that inferiority and is now much superior to all the angels. He is now omnipresent; He can be simultaneously in the heavens and on the earth.</p>
<p>The man Jesus, in the fulfillment of the prophecy in Psalm 8, was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death (Heb. 2:9). According to our physical make-up, we are inferior to the angels. The make-up of the angels is somewhat superior to ours. When Jesus came as a man, His physical make-up was also inferior to that of the angels. He became a man, taking on man&rsquo;s flesh, blood, and nature. He took on a physical make-up that was inferior to that of the angels for the purpose of suffering death for us. In order to suffer death, He needed a physical body. Without such a physical body, there would have been no way for Him to die for our sins. This was the reason that He was made a little inferior to the angels.</p>
<p>Christ was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death so that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything. This means that He died for everything. Christ tasted death not only for human beings but for everything, every creature. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; redemption was accomplished not only for people but for everything created by God. Thus, God can reconcile all things to Himself through Christ (Col. 1:20). This is clearly typified by the redemption accomplished through Noah&rsquo;s ark, in which not only eight persons but all living things created by God were saved (Gen. 7:13-23). This is a profound revelation. We should be impressed that Christ not only tasted death for man but also for all other things. This is the reason we say that Christ&rsquo;s death was an all-inclusive death.</p>
<p>Romans 8:21 says, &ldquo;In hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.&rdquo; The whole creation needs to be freed from the slavery of corruption, so the whole creation needs Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Everything in the old creation is corrupting, decaying, and dying. In this universe everything, including human beings, animals, and plants, is decaying. Everything created in the whole universe needs redemption. Eventually, the millennium will be a time of the restoration of all things. Restoration implies degradation, and degradation comes from sin.</p>
<p>In the universe two rebellions brought in death, corruption, and degradation to the entire creation. One was the satanic rebellion, and the other was man&rsquo;s rebellion. Before man&rsquo;s rebellion there was a satanic rebellion, which contaminated the heavens. Satan&rsquo;s rebellion contaminated, made filthy, all the heavenly things. Such a contaminated, degraded universe can be restored only through Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Before the creation can be restored, it must be redeemed. Christ died on the cross for all the items of the creation so that He could reconcile all these items back to God. Christ&rsquo;s redemption is a foundation laid for the upcoming restoration. When the restoration comes, the slavery of corruption will be over. The day is coming when decay and corruption will be over and death will be swallowed up. Today the entire creation is under the slavery of corruption; hence, the entire creation is groaning. Everything is groaning because everything is under the slavery of corruption.</p>
<p>The man Jesus was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, yet this inferiority was only for a certain period of time. Through His death and resurrection, this one man was not only made superior to the angels but also has become a corporate man, the new man, composed of all the believers in Christ (Eph. 2:14-15).</p><h2 class="head4">c. Having Destroyed through Death in the Flesh<br />
Him Who Has the Might of Death, the Devil,<br />
and Released Those Who because of the Fear of Death<br />
through All Their Life Were Held in Slavery</h2>
<p>Hebrews 2:14-15 tells us that through death in the flesh Christ destroyed him who has the might of death, that is, the devil, and released those who because of the fear of death through all their life were held in slavery. Our body is becoming increasingly old because it is under the slavery of death. In fact, man, since the day of his birth, is not living but dying every day. All human beings, whether young or old, are dying. Likewise, all beautiful flowers are not living but dying. Although they may be beautiful now, sooner or later they will fade and lose their beauty. Everything in the universe is decaying, dying, because it is held in the slavery of death. The grass is dying, yet it is not afraid of death because it has no feeling, no consciousness. On the contrary, because we human beings are sensitive and have strong feelings, we are very concerned about and threatened by death. Throughout our lifetime, we are held in the slavery of death. Yet Christ annulled this slavery, for He destroyed death at its root. The destruction of this enslaving death will not be fully carried out until the end of the millennium, at which time death, the last enemy, will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14).</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;destroy&rdquo; in Hebrews 2:14 may also be rendered &ldquo;bring to nought, make of none effect, do away with, abolish, annul, discard.&rdquo; After the devil, the serpent, seduced man into the fall, God promised that the seed of woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15). In the fullness of the time the Son of God came to become flesh (John 1:14; Rom. 8:3) by being born of a virgin (Gal. 4:4), that He might destroy the devil in man&rsquo;s flesh through His death in the flesh on the cross. This was to abolish Satan, to bring him to nought. Satan has been abolished and done away with. Christ destroyed him, annulled him, brought him to nought, and rendered him powerless.</p>
<p>Perhaps we may ask, &ldquo;How could the devil have been destroyed when he is still so prevailing?&rdquo; It is a lie to say that the devil is prevailing. The Bible never says this. We should not believe in this lie. The Bible says that the devil has been bruised, destroyed. His head has been crushed. Will we believe our feelings or God&rsquo;s Word? God&rsquo;s Word tells us that through His death on the cross Christ destroyed the devil. This is an accomplished fact, a fact that is included in the holy Word as the testament bequeathed to us. We need to take this bequest by faith according to the holy Word.</p>
<p>Christ destroyed Satan. He partook of our nature in order to destroy the devil who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14-15). The best way to defeat Satan is to shame him, telling him that he has been defeated and destroyed and that he should go back to his place and keep his position. If we shame Satan in this way, he will go. By partaking of our nature and destroying Satan, Christ has released us from slavery. Death has been abolished; Satan, who holds the power of death, has been destroyed; and we have been released from slavery.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s death also released us from the slavery under the fear of death (v. 15). Since through His death Christ tasted death for us and destroyed the devil who has the might of death, His death released us from the slavery in which we were held because of the fear of death. We have been released from this slavery. Because of the all-inclusive crucifixion of Christ, there is no more death, no more sin, no more devil, no more fear of death, and no more slavery. By His mercy, the Lord has opened our eyes and has shown us the all-inclusiveness of His death. Now through experience we realize that death, sin, the devil, the fear of death, and slavery were all truly crossed out in Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. God Having Crowned Him with Glory and Honor</h2>
<p>Verse 9 tells us that God crowned Christ with glory and honor. Glory is the splendor related to Jesus&rsquo; person; honor is the preciousness related to Jesus&rsquo; worth, value, and dignity, which is related to His position (2 Pet. 1:17; cf. 1 Pet. 2:17; Rom. 13:7). Glory refers to Christ&rsquo;s expression of God, whereas honor refers to the highest position in the universe, which the resurrected and ascended Christ occupies. In 1 Peter 2:7 the Greek word for <em>preciousness</em> is the same as that for <em>honor</em> in Hebrews 2:9.</p>
<p>The prophecy in Psalm 8 says that God has &ldquo;crowned&rdquo; man, who is lower than the angels, &ldquo;with glory and honor&rdquo; (v. 5). This was not fulfilled in any man until the man Jesus ascended to the heavens. Hence, this prophecy concerns the Lord as a man, and it is fulfilled in Him.</p>
<p>After resurrection Christ was glorified, not only in the manifestation of His divine nature but also in the ascension into God&rsquo;s glory. Christ not only entered into glory but was also crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9). Man crowned Him with thorns to shame Him (John 19:2), but God crowned Him with glory and honor to glorify Him. We saw Him on the cross on earth with the crown of thorns, but now we see Him on the throne in heaven crowned with glory and honor.</p>
<p>After He accomplished redemption by suffering death, Jesus was glorified in His resurrection (Luke 24:26) and was crowned with glory and honor in His ascension to the heavens (Heb. 2:9). Although the Lord Jesus is both the Son of God and the Son of Man, when we come to the matter of His being crowned with glory and honor, we must pay special attention to His humanity, to His being the Son of Man. It is in His humanity that He is crowned with glory and honor. As a man in His ascension to the heavens, He was crowned in this way.</p>
<p>Jesus is crowned with glory and honor in the third heaven. The little Jesus who was born in the manger, who was raised in a poor home in Nazareth, and who had no beauty or comeliness, in His ascension to the heavens was crowned with glory and honor.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s ascension, which followed His resurrection, was an exaltation. From the earthly viewpoint, it was an ascension from man, but from the heavenly viewpoint, it was an exaltation by God. After Christ had been crowned with glory and honor in His ascension, God gave Him the dominion over all things in His exaltation (v. 7). This is similar to what God did with Adam. Adam lost the dominion that God gave to him, but according to the prophecy of Psalm 8, Christ recovered what Adam lost. Now the same dominion has been given to the second man. We all must declare that we were born in the first man, but we were reborn in the second man. We were born in the first man and lost everything with him, but since we have been reborn in the second man, we have regained everything. The second man has been glorified, crowned with glory and honor, and entrusted with the divine dominion that was lost by the first man.</p>
<p>Jesus was crowned with glory and honor to be the Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36; 10:36b). Before His incarnation, He was the Lord. However, as a man, He was not the Lord. Now, in His ascension, He, as a man, has been crowned to be the Lord. This is a great matter. On the one hand, He already was the Lord because He was God; on the other hand, in His humanity He was crowned to be the Lord of all. He is also the Christ, that is, the anointed One. <em>The Lord</em> means that He is the Lord ruling over all, and <em>Christ</em> means that He is the anointed One who has been appointed to accomplish everything for God&rsquo;s plan. The anointed One is the appointed One, and the appointed One is the One who runs God&rsquo;s universal corporation, Christ and the church.</p>
<p>Christ was exalted as Leader and Savior (5:31). The Greek word for <em>Leader,</em> translated &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; in the King James Version, is the same Greek word that is rendered &ldquo;Author&rdquo; in Hebrews 2:10. The Greek word may also be rendered &ldquo;Captain, Originator, Inaugurator, or Pioneer.&rdquo; Christ was crowned with glory and honor so that He might be our Captain. As the Greek word indicates, He is also our Leader, Prince, Pioneer, and Forerunner. Jesus is the One who fights, takes the lead, moves ahead, being the first to reach His destination. He has cut the way into glory, and we are now taking the way that He has cut. Hence, He is not only the Savior who saved us from our fallen estate and from all the negative things; He is also the Captain who, as the Pioneer, has entered into glory that we might be brought into the same estate. The Lord Jesus today is the Lord, the Christ, the Captain, and the Savior.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2 tells us that one day the man Jesus, who for a time was made a little inferior to the angels, resurrected and ascended to the third heaven and was crowned with glory and honor (v. 7). A man is now in heaven, crowned with glory and honor. Although the angels are in heaven, they are not crowned. Yet there is now a man crowned in heaven. We should not prefer to be angels. We should be fully satisfied to be a man, having Christ within us and being in Christ. In Him we also are crowned with glory and honor.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<p>In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son of Man who is better than the angels.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. God Having Made Him, the Author of Salvation, Perfect through Sufferings</h2>
<p>According to Hebrews 2:10, God made Christ &ldquo;the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;Author&rdquo; means &ldquo;Captain, Originator, Inaugurator, Leader, and Pioneer.&rdquo; The salvation mentioned in this verse and referred to in verse 3 and 1:14 saves us from our fallen state into glory. Jesus, as the Pioneer, the Forerunner (6:20), took the lead to enter into glory, and we, His followers, are taking the same way to be brought into the same glory, which was ordained by God for us (1 Cor. 2:7; 1 Thes. 2:12). He cut the way, and we are now taking the way. Hence, He is not only the Savior who saved us from our fallen state but also the Author who, as the Pioneer, entered into glory that we may be brought into the same estate.</p>
<p>Christ is the Captain of salvation. This expression indicates that all the saved believers are an army with Christ the Forerunner as their Captain. He was also made perfect through sufferings. This refers to His humanity. He was not only perfect in His humanity; He was also perfected through many sufferings as a man.</p>
<p>In order to be saved merely from hell, we do not need a captain, but if we are to enter into glory, into the good land of rest, we need the Captain. God&rsquo;s salvation is not merely to rescue us from hell and to put us into heaven. His salvation is to save us from every negative thing and to bring us into glory, into a glorious rest. This kind of salvation is not an overnight matter; it is a lifelong process. We need to follow our Captain throughout our entire life.</p>
<p>The children of Israel came out of Egypt in one night. That was truly an overnight matter. However, in order for them to enter the good land of rest, they needed to follow their captain. At the beginning they followed Moses, and later they followed Joshua. They had a captain for their salvation. After they crossed the Red Sea, they surely were saved, but they were saved to a very small degree. They had gone only a small part of the way and needed to follow their captain the entire rest of the way. They had such a captain of salvation.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish His purpose of bringing many sons into glory, God had to have an example, a model. Such a one could be the qualified captain taking the lead to bring the many sons into glory. Jesus is this Captain. Before Jesus became the Captain, however, He had to be perfected through sufferings (Heb. 2:10). To make Jesus perfect was to make Him perfect in terms of qualification. It does not imply that there was any imperfection of virtue or attribute in Jesus but only that the completing of His experience of human sufferings was needed to make Him fit to become the Author, the Leader, of His followers&rsquo; salvation.</p>
<p>As the self-existing and ever-existing God, the Lord Jesus is complete from eternity to eternity. But He needed to be perfected through the processes of incarnation, the partaking of human nature, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension so that He might be qualified to be God&rsquo;s Christ and our Savior.</p>
<p>Without passing through sufferings, the Lord Jesus as a man could not be in the glory, and if He were not in the glory, He would not be perfected or qualified. But by passing through the sufferings, He entered into glory. He is now fully qualified, fully perfected, to fulfill His office of Captain.</p>
<p>The writer of Hebrews mentions suffering because at the time this Epistle was written the Hebrew Christians were suffering (10:32-35). They were being persecuted. In a sense, their suffering was not good, for they were very troubled by it. In another sense, however, that suffering was the process which was helping them to enter into glory. The Lord Jesus, as the Captain of salvation, passed through all the sufferings and entered into glory. He is our Pioneer, our Forerunner. He has gone before us to cut the way into glory. The way has been paved, and all we need to do is follow Him. We should not be troubled by our sufferings. We should be comforted. All the sufferings are helping us along the highways to Zion (Psa. 84:5).</p>
<p>The more we follow Christ in His way, the more we must be prepared to experience sufferings. Sufferings are good; they are a great help. We need to thank the Lord for our sufferings because all the sufferings are our helpers. The more we Christians pray and love the Lord, the more problems we may have. According to our experiences, we can realize that many problems are precisely measured out. They are neither too long nor too short, and they all seem to come at just the right time. As we look back upon our experiences, we see how good it was that certain things happened when they did. We should not be bothered by our problems. Whatever happens to us, we should praise the Lord, declaring that this is the process of entering into glory. He is leading us into the glory, which has been sown into our inner being. The glory that has been sown into us as a seed will be developed into the glory which we will enter.</p>
<p>The glory into which we will enter is the glory of the divine element that has been sown into us, the blossoming of the divine element within us. We are not entering into this glory on our own but with the Captain who pioneered the way, who entered into glory, and who is now leading us into glory.</p>
<p>When Paul was suffering because of a thorn in the flesh, he asked the Lord three times to remove it (2 Cor. 12:7-8). But the Lord answered Paul, saying, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you&rdquo; (v. 9). Instead of taking away the thorn, the Lord afforded Paul His sufficient grace, ministering Himself to the apostle as the supply, the grace, to sustain and support him as he passed through all the sufferings. Hence, these sufferings produced glory in him.</p><h2 class="head4">f.The Sanctifier and the Sanctified<br />
Being All of One Father; Hence, He Calling Them Brothers and Declaring the Father&rsquo;s Name to Them, and in Their Midst Singing Hymns unto God the Father</h2>
<p>Hebrews 2:11-12 says, &ldquo;For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying, &lsquo;I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.&rsquo;&rdquo; Christ the Sanctifier is of the Father, and the believers as those being sanctified are also of the Father. For this reason, He called them brothers, declared the Father&rsquo;s name to them, and sang hymns of praise unto God the Father. This took place after His resurrection. According to John 20, the resurrected Christ as the firstborn Son of God came to meet with the disciples as His brothers.</p>
<p>He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God. Both the firstborn Son and the many sons of God are born of the same Father God in resurrection (Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3) and have the same divine life and nature. Hence, He is not ashamed to call them brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Sanctifier and the Sanctified<br />
Being All of One Father</h2>
<p>According to Hebrews 2:11, &ldquo;Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One.&rdquo; He who sanctifies is Christ, and those who are being sanctified are the believers. Hence, Christ and we the believers are all of One. The Greek word translated &ldquo;of&rdquo; actually means &ldquo;out of.&rdquo; This means that Christ and we, the Sanctifier and the sanctified, are all out of one source, one Father. The source surely does not refer to position but to nature, to disposition. The Sanctifier and the sanctified are all out of one source, one Father. The Father is the source of the Sanctifier, and He is the source of all the sanctified.</p>
<p>He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all out of One. Because of this, He is not ashamed to call us brothers. Rather, it is glorious for Him to call us brothers because He and we are of the same source. He has come from the Father, and we also have come out of the Father.</p>
<p>The Sanctifier is the Son of God. In His original state and before His incarnation, the Son of God could not sanctify us. However, the Sanctifier today is not only the Son of God but the Son of God incarnated. If He had never been incarnated, He would be unable to sanctify us.</p>
<p>As the incarnated One, Christ is the Son of Man. This Son of Man could not sanctify us until He was crucified, resurrected, glorified, and exalted. These are His qualifications for Him to be our Sanctifier. The incarnated Son of God needed to pass through death and resurrection so that His humanity might be born of God and that He might be glorified and exalted into the position of His being Sanctifier.</p>
<p>In order to be the Sanctifier, Christ had to be produced as the firstborn Son of God (1:6). The Firstborn can sanctify us because He, like us, has two natures and because we have the same natures that He has. Our Sanctifier is not the only begotten Son of God; He is the firstborn Son of God, the One who has the human nature as well as the divine nature. Because He and we are of the same two natures, He can sanctify us. Only when the firstborn Son was produced could the Sanctifier come into His office to do His sanctifying work. This means that He had to pass through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and exaltation. After passing through this process, He became the firstborn Son of God. In other words, the firstborn Son of God was produced. This is our Sanctifier. He is qualified to be our Sanctifier, and we are qualified to be the sanctified.</p>
<p>He is qualified to be the Sanctifier because He is the firstborn Son of God, and we are qualified to be the sanctified because we are the many sons of God. He was qualified through His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and exaltation. After passing through this process, He became the firstborn Son of God. Our qualifications to be the sanctified are that we have the propitiation for our sins (2:17), that we have been released from the slavery of death (vv. 14-15), and that we have been brought forth to be the many sons of God (v. 10). Now both He and we are qualified. He is the qualified Sanctifier, and we are the qualified sanctified. We are fully qualified through the propitiation and resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Sanctifier and the sanctified are all out of One. This means that they are all out of one Father. Both the Sanctifier and the sanctified are sons born of the same Father. Since He and we are born of the same Father, we are His brothers. We and He have all come out of the same source, and we share with Him the same life and nature. In this life and nature we are now under His sanctifying work to transform us from being natural and to conform us to His image so that we may be glorified with the glory of God. Sanctification is to separate the reborn sons of God unto God, to transform them metabolically and organically with the element of the divine life, to conform them to His image, and to glorify them with His glory. The meaning of God&rsquo;s sanctifying work is that the firstborn Son of God is working on the many sons of God.</p><h2 class="head5">2) Declaring the Father&rsquo;s Name to the Brothers</h2>
<p>Verse 12 goes on to say, &ldquo;I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.&rdquo; The firstborn Son declared the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers after He resurrected from the dead, when He met with the Father&rsquo;s many sons (John 20:17, 19-23). The church mentioned in Hebrews 2:12 is referred to as a corporate composition of the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2:11-12 indicates that in resurrection Christ has brought forth many brothers. Through His resurrection we were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3). His death released the divine life from within Him, and His resurrection imparted the life of God into us in order that we might become the many sons of God and His many brothers. He was the one grain of wheat falling into the ground, dying, and growing up to bring forth many grains, which we are (John 12:24). He was the one grain, and we are now the many grains, His many brothers, brought forth by Him in His resurrection. Hence, immediately after His resurrection He called us His brothers (John 20:17).</p>
<p>In His resurrection Christ not only brought forth many brothers but also came to His brothers and declared to them the Father&rsquo;s name (Heb. 2:12). The Father&rsquo;s name is simply the Father. The Father is His name. The Father means the source of life and the source of being. We are all out of Him. The Sanctifier, the firstborn Son, and all the sanctified ones, the many sons, are all out of the one Father. On the day of His resurrection, the Lord declared the Father&rsquo;s name to the disciples. From that day on Peter came to realize that he had the divine nature. Thus, in his second Epistle, Peter says that we are &ldquo;partakers of the divine nature,&rdquo; having received &ldquo;all things which relate to life and godliness&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:4, 3). We have received the divine nature, and all things pertaining to life have been given to us because we were all born of the Father.</p>
<p>In the church the firstborn Son of God declares the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers. Because the Father is the source of the divine life and nature, to declare the name of the Father is to show the many brothers the source of this life and nature. Although the Jewish people in ancient times knew God, they did not know the Father. They knew God as the Creator but not as the Father who begets. They knew God&rsquo;s creating power, but they did not know the Father&rsquo;s begetting ability. They knew God&rsquo;s power, but they did not realize the Father&rsquo;s life. Before the resurrection, not even the disciples of Jesus knew the Father&rsquo;s life and begetting ability. Before the day of resurrection, they knew only as much as the Jewish people did. However, on the day of resurrection the Lord came to them to declare the Father to make them know the Father as the source of life.</p>
<p>According to John 20, Jesus visited His disciples in the evening on the day of His resurrection. But John does not explicitly say that He declared the Father to the disciples. This is mentioned prophetically in Psalm 22:22. According to that prophecy, after His resurrection Christ came mainly to His disciples to make the Father known to them. The Father&rsquo;s life and nature had become theirs. The Father&rsquo;s being had been transferred into their being. This is what it means to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to the disciples. That declaration was not merely a matter of mentioning the name; it was an impartation of all that the Father is&mdash;the Father&rsquo;s life, nature, and being&mdash;into the disciples. We, the sons of God, have all become partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). To us, God is no longer only the creating God but also the begetting Father. He has begotten us; He has imparted His life, His nature, and even His being into our being. This is what it means to declare the Father&rsquo;s name.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) Praising the Father in the Church</h2>
<p>In resurrection Christ not only declared the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers but also praised the Father in the church (Heb. 2:11-12). When the Lord declared the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers, He praised the Father&rsquo;s name in the church. The brothers are the church. Individually speaking, they are His brothers, and collectively speaking, they are the church brought forth in His resurrection. In the evening of the day of His resurrection His brothers gathered together, and He came to meet with them. That was the first church meeting. In the church meeting the Lord not only declared the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers, but He also praised the Father in the midst of the church.</p>
<p>This is the firstborn Son&rsquo;s praising of the Father within the Father&rsquo;s many sons in the church meetings. When we, the many sons of God, meet as the church and praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praising. It is not that He praises the Father apart from us and alone; rather, He praises within us and with us through our praising. In our singing He sings hymns of praise to the Father. If then we do not sing, how can He sing? The more we sing to the Father, the more we enjoy His presence, His moving, His anointing, and His life-imparting within us. Thus we will grow in Him and be brought into His glorification above all.</p>
<p>Today in the proper church meeting, the resurrected Christ is in our midst, although He is invisible. As Matthew 18:20 tells us, where there are two or three gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, there He is in their midst. In the church meetings, He meets with us and sings hymns of praise to the Father. In fact, He sings in us; He sings in our singing. Because Christ is within us, if we are silent, He has no way to sing. Likewise, if we do not speak, He cannot speak. When we sing, He sings; when we speak, He speaks. Since He is not only in our midst but also within us, we need to take the initiative to speak and sing so that He can speak and sing hymns of praise to the Father in our speaking and singing.</p>
<p>Throughout all the centuries the firstborn Son has been continually singing hymns of praise unto the Father in the church. He does this in all of His brothers. When we sing hymns to the Father from our spirit, He sings with us in our spirit. This is wonderful. The church on earth today is one corporate Body with the firstborn Son of God. In the meetings of the church, the firstborn Son of God sings praise to the Father. Whenever we come to the meetings, we must open our mouths to praise the Father. If we do this, immediately we cooperate with the indwelling firstborn Son of God. To gain more of the firstborn Son, we need to praise the Father. The more we praise the Father, the more we gain the firstborn Son. The more we sing, the more He sings in our singing. The best way to have Christ work together with us is by singing praises to the Father.</p>
<p>Christ has made the Father known to us as the source of life. Now in the church meetings He is waiting for us to cooperate with Him in singing praises to the Father. The best way for us to give Him this cooperation is to open our spirit and sing praise to the Father. The more we sing, the more we will enjoy His singing. When we praise the Father, we enjoy Christ. We are one with Christ in praising the Father in the church meetings. The more we praise the Father in the church meetings, the more He praises the Father in our praising, and the more we enjoy Him and gain Him.</p><h2 class="head4">g. He Being Made Like His Brothers in All Things<br />
That He Might Become a Merciful and Faithful<br />
High Priest in the Things Pertaining to God,<br />
to Make Propitiation for Their Sins</h2>
<p>Hebrews 2:17 says, &ldquo;Hence He should have been made like His brothers in all things that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in the things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.&rdquo; The Son of God was made like us, His brothers, in that He partook of blood and flesh (v. 14). This was done for two purposes, one negative and the other positive. The negative purpose was to destroy for us the devil, who is in the flesh. The positive purpose is to be our merciful and faithful High Priest who has the human nature, that He may sympathize with us in all things.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Being Made like His Brothers in All Things</h2>
<p>The Lord was made like His brothers in all things in order that He might sympathize with them. It is a matter of sympathy that Christ shared in our nature, partaking of blood and flesh. He is the firstborn Son of God, and we are His many brothers. Yet we all are weak and fragile in the flesh, so He became a man in the flesh, the same as we are. Because we are weak and fragile, we need Him to sympathize with us. The Lord&rsquo;s sympathizing with us is an aspect of His incarnation.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Being a Merciful and Faithful High Priest</h2>
<p>As the High Priest, Christ ministers God Himself and the riches of the divine life to us. As the God-man, He is fully qualified to be our High Priest. The first two chapters of Hebrews mainly cover two points&mdash;that Christ is the Son of God, God Himself, and the Son of Man, man Himself. <em>Merciful</em> corresponds with His being a man, and <em>faithful</em> corresponds with His being God.</p>
<p>Being merciful corresponds with the matter of Christ&rsquo;s being a man. He became a man and lived on earth as a man passing through all the human sufferings. As a result, He is fully qualified to be merciful to us. He knows how to be merciful to man. He is a man with the experiences of human life, with the experiences of human suffering.</p>
<p>He was incarnated to be like us (vv. 14, 17). We may even say that He is more than like us, for He suffered in His human life some things that we have not suffered. In order to be qualified to be a merciful High Priest, He became like us, sympathizing with all of our weaknesses.</p>
<p>If we would be faithful, we not only need virtue but also the ability to keep our word. Christ as the High Priest is the faithful God. God is faithful (10:23). He is able to fulfill whatever He says. God never lies (6:18). Whatever He has spoken He is able to fulfill; He has every means to fulfill what He has spoken. Only God can be fully faithful. None of us can be completely faithful. In contrast, nothing can frustrate God from fulfilling His word. Jesus can be a faithful High Priest because He is the almighty God. Since He, as the Son of God, is God Himself, He is able to be faithful. Although, as the many sons of God and as the many brothers of the Firstborn, we are divine as well as human, we are not almighty. We are human in our human nature and divine in His divine nature, but we are not almighty in His deity. Since He is the almighty God, He can be faithful to us.</p>
<p>Christ can be a merciful and faithful High Priest because He is the Son of Man with the human nature and the Son of God with the divine nature. He is fully qualified. Our High Priest, Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the Son of Man, is both merciful and faithful because He is both God and man.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) To Make Propitiation for Their Sins</h2>
<p>In His death Christ made propitiation for the sins of God&rsquo;s people (2:17). The Greek word for <em>propitiation</em> here is <em>hilaskomai</em> which means to appease, to reconcile one by satisfying the other&rsquo;s demand, that is, to propitiate. The Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous demands on us. Thus, He has appeased God for us.</p>
<p>Jesus made propitiation for our sins, thereby satisfying the demand of God&rsquo;s righteousness and appeasing the relationship between God and us, that God may be peacefully gracious to us. He has settled every problem between us and God. Since we create problems between us and God, all of which need to be solved, every day we need to enjoy Christ as the propitiatory sacrifice, which appeases God for our situation.</p>
<p>He has made purification of sins (1:3). Thus, we should be at peace. Our sins have been purified. Although we must hate our sins, we need not be bothered by them. Christ has purified us of our sins once for all (7:27).</p>
<p>The first two chapters of Hebrews reveal that Christ as the Son of God, God Himself, through His incarnation, ascension, and glorification made Himself the same as we are and made us the same as He is. We are human, and He made Himself human. He is divine, and He made us to have the divine life and nature. Since He is such a man, and at the same time God Himself, He is superior to the angels. In chapter 1 Christ is God, and in chapter 2 He is man. He is the God-man, the mingling of God and man.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 of Hebrews reveals that Christ is the Son of God coming to speak, declare, and express God. As such a One He is superior to the angels. In chapter 2 He is the Son of Man going to be the Lord, the Christ, the Captain, and the Savior. His being our Lord, Christ, Captain, and Savior is not based mainly upon His divinity but upon His humanity. This is a very practical matter. It is because He is a man that He is the Lord, Christ, Captain, and Savior. Angels, who do not have humanity, can never be our Lord, Christ, Captain, and Savior. Only Christ in His humanity can be such a One to us. Furthermore, this humanity is not a natural humanity; it is a resurrected, uplifted, and ascended humanity, a humanity that is crowned with God&rsquo;s glory and honor.</p>
<p>At this point it would be helpful to consider certain contrasts between Hebrews 1 and 2 in the way they reveal Christ for our experience and enjoyment. In chapter 1 Christ is the Son of God, but in chapter 2 He is the Son of Man (1:2, 5; 2:6). Chapter 1 also tells us that Christ is in the heavens, but chapter 2 says that He is on the earth (1:3, 13; 2:9, 14). In chapter 1 Christ is on the throne, but in chapter 2 He is in the church (1:3; 2:12). Chapter 1 says that Christ is at the right hand of God, but chapter 2 says that Christ is with the children whom God has given to Him (1:3; 2:13). In chapter 1 Christ is the One whom the angels of God worship, but in chapter 2 He is the One who praises God (1:6; 2:12). Finally, in chapter 1 Christ is the One in whom people trust, but in chapter 2 He is the One who is trusting (1:10-12; 2:13).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">96. The One Better Than Moses</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 3:1-6 we see that Christ is the One better than Moses.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a.Jesus, the Apostle and<br />
High Priest of Our Confession</h2>
<p>As the Apostle and High Priest, Christ is superior to both Moses and Aaron. We see these two titles of Christ in 3:1 where we are told to &ldquo;consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus.&rdquo; Jesus is our Apostle and our High Priest. As the Apostle, He is typified by Moses; as the High Priest, He is typified by Aaron. The Apostle is the One who was sent to us from God and with God (John 6:46; 8:16, 29). The High Priest is the One who went to God from and with us (Eph. 2:6). As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we might partake of His life, nature, and fullness. As the High Priest, Christ went to God with us to present us to God that we and all our case might be fully cared for by Him. As the Apostle, He is typified by Moses who came from God to serve the house of God (Heb. 3:2-6), and as the High Priest, He is typified by Aaron, who went to God with the house of Israel and their cases (4:14&mdash;7:28). This refers to a marvelous traffic between God and us: as the Apostle, Christ came to us from God and with God; as the High Priest, He went back to God from us and with us. As such, Jesus is the Apostle and High Priest of our confession. Our confession is what we believe in and what we declare to the universe.</p>
<p>Jesus was the first Apostle in the New Testament. The word <em>apostle</em> in Greek means &ldquo;a sent one, one who is sent by a higher authority.&rdquo; In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus frequently spoke of Himself as the One who was sent by God (5:23-24, 30, 36; 6:57). For instance, He declared in 5:24, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life.&rdquo; This verse indicates that we should believe the One who sent the Son. Since Christ is the Father&rsquo;s sent One, He is the Father&rsquo;s Apostle. God sent Him to us. He came from God with God to bring God to us and to minister God into us. Nothing and no one can be higher, greater, and more profound than such an Apostle.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the unique Apostle of God. He was sent by God to bring God to man, to impart God into man, and to dispense all that the Triune God is into God&rsquo;s chosen people. As the Apostle, God&rsquo;s sent One and Ambassador, Christ speaks the word of God (3:34). The word Christ speaks is the <em>rhema,</em> the word that is spirit and life (6:63). By speaking the word of God, He imparts God&rsquo;s essence into our being.</p>
<p>Hebrews 3:5 says, &ldquo;Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken later.&rdquo; Here the word <em>testimony</em> refers to Moses&rsquo; being a prefigure. This indicates that Moses is a type of the real and genuine Apostle sent from God.</p>
<p>Moses is a type of Jesus as the Apostle, the sent One. When the children of Israel were suffering persecution under the tyranny of Pharaoh, God appeared to Moses and charged him to go to the children of Israel and to Pharaoh. Thus, Moses was an Old Testament apostle. Moses was God&rsquo;s sent one, the apostle who was to lead Israel out of Egypt and through the wilderness for the purpose that they might be constituted as God&rsquo;s house and be formed into a habitation of God on earth. This habitation of God is symbolized by the tabernacle made by the children of Israel in the wilderness. The tabernacle, however, is only a symbol; it was not the real habitation of God. At that time, God&rsquo;s real habitation on earth was the children of Israel themselves. The children of Israel were formed and constituted into a house of God by Moses, God&rsquo;s apostle. Moses, the apostle sent by God to the children of Israel, is a type of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Faithful to God Who Constituted Him,<br />
as Also Moses Was in All God&rsquo;s House</h2>
<p>Verse 2 tells us that Jesus was faithful to God &ldquo;who constituted Him, as also Moses was in all His house.&rdquo; Moses, as God&rsquo;s sent one to take care of God&rsquo;s house, was faithful to God in all His house. This typifies Christ, as the Apostle from God, for God&rsquo;s house, being faithful to God who constituted Him. Christ, typified by Moses, was faithful to God in taking care of God&rsquo;s house. Hebrews 2:17 tells us that He is faithful as the High Priest, whereas 3:2 tells us that He is faithful as the Apostle sent from God to us.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Counted Worthy of More Glory Than Moses,<br />
as the Builder of the House<br />
Has More Honor Than the House</h2>
<p>Verses 3 and 4 say, &ldquo;For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by as much as He who built the house has more honor than the house. For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.&rdquo; Both Christ and Moses are apostles. Yet Christ is the Builder of the house of God, whereas Moses was only a part of the house in type. Hence, Moses is inferior to Christ. Christ is counted worthy of far more glory than Moses.</p>
<p>Verse 4 says that every house has a builder, but He who built all things is God. This proves that the Christ who is the Builder is God Himself. This Apostle, the One sent by God, is God Himself. He is the universal Builder, the unique Builder in the entire universe. The central building of His ministry is His house. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;Christ was faithful as a Son over His house, whose house we are.&rdquo; We are the house which Christ is building.</p>
<p>This house is the church. Christ is the Builder of the church (Matt. 16:18). Christ builds the church by caring for all the needs of His people, as Moses did, and by bringing His people to pass through the wilderness into the rest of the good land. The good land typifies Christ Himself, and the wilderness is a type of the soulish life. Christ builds up the church by bringing us through the soulish life into our spirit where He abides as the rest, the good land. Our concept may be that God sent Christ to us as an Apostle greater than Moses in order only to take care of our needs. If we need manna, He gives us manna. If we need living water, He gives us living water. If we need peace and joy, He gives us peace and joy. However, if we think only in this way, we are shortsighted. In the picture in the Old Testament, Moses did not care for the people&rsquo;s needs merely for their own enjoyment&mdash;he took care of them so that the tabernacle would be built up among them as God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>Christ is not only a part of the house but also the Builder of the house (Heb. 3:3-4). Moses had only one nature&mdash;humanity. This human nature is good as the material for God&rsquo;s building, but Moses did not have the divine nature which is good for being the builder. The Lord Jesus has two natures: humanity, which is good for the material for the building of God&rsquo;s habitation, and divinity, which is the element of the Builder. In His humanity, Jesus is the stone for God&rsquo;s habitation. He is the foundation stone (Isa. 28:16), the cornerstone (Matt. 21:42; Acts 4:11), the topstone (Zech. 4:7), and the living stone (1 Pet. 2:4) to produce us as living stones (v. 5). In His humanity He is the good material for God&rsquo;s building, and in His divinity He is the Builder. Moses was an apostle sent from God to constitute God&rsquo;s house on earth, and Christ is also the Apostle doing the same thing. But Christ is not only a part of the building; He is also the Builder. This is the difference between Christ and Moses.</p>
<p>Moses was only a part of the house, whereas Christ is both the house and the Builder of the house. Thus, Christ is counted worthy of more glory and honor than Moses (Heb. 3:3). We need to see that Christ as the Builder of the house has more glory and honor than Moses. Hence, Christ is much superior to Moses.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. As the Son over God&rsquo;s House, Whose House We Are</h2>
<p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;Christ was faithful as a Son over His house, whose house we are.&rdquo; In Old Testament times the house of God was the house of Israel (Lev. 22:18; Num. 12:7), symbolized by the tabernacle or the temple, which was in Israel&rsquo;s midst (Exo. 25:8; Ezek. 37:26-27). Today the house of God is actually the church (1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 4:17). The children of Israel, as the people of God, are a type of us, the New Testament believers (1 Cor. 9:24&mdash;10:11). Their entire history is a prefigure of the church.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 3 Christ is the Apostle, and the brothers are the house of God. The church has a double function. To Christ, the church is the Body; to God, the church is the house. Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body of the Head. This is the first function of the church. God is the Father, and the church is His house. This is the second function of the church. Just as Christ is the Head and the church is His Body, so God is the Father and the church is His house. The church as the Body of Christ is an organism. In like manner, the church as the house of God is not a physical house; it is a living house.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;house&rdquo; may be translated as &ldquo;household,&rdquo; or using the modern term <em>folks,</em> the members of a family. God&rsquo;s house is not a physical house but a living house. God&rsquo;s house is His family, and His family is His house. His house is also His household, for His folks are His dwelling place. If a certain family has a house, the family is one thing and the house is another. The family is living, and the house is physical. But God&rsquo;s family and God&rsquo;s house are both living.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s house is living in the Father&rsquo;s name and in the Father&rsquo;s life. When we say that it is living in the Father&rsquo;s name, this means that it is living in the Father&rsquo;s reality. This house is a living composition of the many children of God in the Father&rsquo;s life and reality. Where the house of God is, there is the family of God, and where the family of God is, there is God the Father with His life and reality. This is similar to the church as the Body of Christ. Christ is not separate from all the members of the Body, for as the Head of the Body, Christ indwells all the members. Christ should not be counted as a separate member of the Body, because He is in all the members of the Body. Likewise, God&rsquo;s house is God&rsquo;s family. The Father is not a separate member of the household but is in all of the children. This is Bethel, the house of God, the house that Jacob saw in his dream (Gen. 28). This is the reason that where the church is, there is Bethel, the house of God with the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, as the heavenly ladder (John 1:51). Such a church is the gate of heaven by which people can communicate from the earth to heaven. There is even now a communication between earth and heaven. When we are in the proper church life, we are in the gate of heaven. If we have the spiritual eyes, we can see the angels ascending and descending upon the heavenly ladder.</p>
<p>Who is the One who formed, built, and constituted this house and who takes care of this house? Jesus Christ, the Apostle sent from God, has been and still is constituting and building up His house. This house is a movable, portable house; it is a living and walking house. We are living, walking, and moving. We are walking corporately with the Apostle. God&rsquo;s house is a corporate Body. If we would enjoy the Apostle and the Father with His reality, we must be in the house. We must know that we have an Apostle. Our Captain of salvation and our High Priest are the Apostle, the One sent by God to take care of God&rsquo;s house. If we are not in the house, we will not enjoy Him in His aspect of being the Apostle. We may enjoy Him in other aspects, for He is great, kind, and very merciful, and He will do many things for us. But as far as the church as the house of the Father is concerned, we will not be able to enjoy Him as the Apostle.</p>
<p>For this reason, we should not be individualistic Christians. If we are individualistic, we are through. When we are individualistic, we are separated stones. As separated stones, we have nothing to do with the house. We need to be in the church. What enjoyment, blessing, and grace we have partaken of since we came into the church! We will see wonderful things happen in and to the house.</p>
<p>As the Apostle sent by God and from God to us, Christ builds the house of God (Heb. 3:3). He is the Builder of the house, and we are the house (v. 6). This means that He is building us together as the house of God. In order to enjoy Christ and know Him, we must realize that He is our Builder and that we are a part of the house of God. Without the house of God, the church, it is difficult for us to enjoy Christ&rsquo;s building work. If we would experience and enjoy Him as the Apostle sent by God and from God to us, we need to realize that we are members of the house of God under His building (Eph. 2:19-20).</p>
<p>By taking care of us, Christ builds us together as the house of God. The matter of building is covered also in Hebrews 11, which mentions the New Jerusalem, the holy city (vv. 10, 16). We need to tell the Lord, &ldquo;You are the Builder, and we are the building. We are parts of this building, and now we are under Your care in Your building work. Under Your building work, we enjoy Your care.&rdquo; All builders care much for what they are building. To enjoy Christ&rsquo;s care, we must be a part of His building.</p>
<p>We are God&rsquo;s living, spiritual, organic house (1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 2:5; Eph. 2:21-22), and Christ builds God&rsquo;s house, His church, in an organic way. God in Christ is within us to build Himself into our being and to build us into His being (3:17; John 14:23). He builds His divinity into our humanity and builds our humanity into His divinity in order to mingle and blend His divinity and our humanity into one entity. Christ came into us as the Spirit to be life to us. He is now building with Himself (divinity) and with us (humanity) to produce a home, a dwelling place. Eventually, this dwelling place, which is a mutual abode of God and man, will issue in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2-3, 22).</p>
<p>At this point we need to read Hebrews 3:6-7: &ldquo;Christ was faithful as a Son over His house, whose house we are if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end. Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, &lsquo;Today if you hear His voice.&rsquo;&rdquo; Verse 6 says that we are the house of God and that the Son of God is now over the house taking care of it. If we would enjoy Christ, we need to be in the house and be a part of the house. Verse 7 begins with the word <em>therefore,</em> indicating that it is the continuation of the foregoing verse. The use of the word <em>therefore</em> to connect verses 6 and 7 means that we must take care of the house of God or else we will miss the Sabbath and not enter into rest. Hebrews 4:7, being a continuation of 3:7, says, &ldquo;He again designates a certain day, today, saying in David after so long a time, even as He has said before, &lsquo;Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.&rsquo;&rdquo; Verses 8 and 9 continue, saying, &ldquo;For if Joshua had brought them into rest, He would not have spoken concerning another day after these things. So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.&rdquo; If we put all these verses together, we will see that today the Sabbath rest is the house of God. If we do not remain in the house of God, we will miss the Sabbath rest. The Sabbath rest today is the house of God under the care of the Son of God.</p>
<p>Although thousands of Christians have been saved, so many of them remain in the wilderness; they have never entered into the good land. Today&rsquo;s good land is a situation in which there is God&rsquo;s habitation with God&rsquo;s kingdom. This is the church life. The church is God&rsquo;s house, God&rsquo;s habitation, and God&rsquo;s kingdom. Thus, the church is today&rsquo;s good land. If we miss this, we will miss today&rsquo;s Sabbath rest. The house of God under the care of the Son of God is our rest, home, homeland, land of Immanuel, and good land flowing with milk and honey (Isa. 8:8; Deut 26:9).</p>
<p>In Matthew 11:28-30 the Lord Jesus said that if we are burdened and will come to Him, He will be our rest, and in Matthew 12:8 He said that He is the Lord of the Sabbath. Where is this Christ who is our rest and who is the Lord of the Sabbath? He is in the church. If we would take Christ as our rest, we must be in the church. The book of Revelation mentions clearly that this Christ, the all-inclusive One, is now walking in the midst of the lampstands, that is, among the churches (1:13, 20; 2:1). Not only is He walking among the churches, but as Revelation 2 and 3 reveal, He is the Spirit speaking to the churches. If we want to touch Christ, enjoy Him, and partake of Him as our rest, we need to be in the church. The church life is today&rsquo;s Sabbath rest. We all must endeavor to enter into it, and once we have entered into it, we should never leave it.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(78)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">97. The One Better Than Aaron</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 4 through 7, we see that Christ is the One better than Aaron, who as a high priest is a type of Christ. The Lord Jesus first was sent from God to us through incarnation (2:14) to be our Apostle (3:1), our Author, our Leader (2:10), the One superior to Moses (3:3), and our real Joshua (4:8) to bring us, His partners (1:9; 3:14), into glory and rest (2:10; 4:11). He then went back from us to God through resurrection and ascension (5:5-6) to be our High Priest to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs (2:17-18; 4:15).</p>
<p>As the High Priest, Christ is continually in the Holy of Holies. Our High Priest is not at the altar offering the sacrifices, nor in the Holy Place preparing the bread of the Presence, lighting the lamps, and burning the incense. He is in the Holy of Holies. Most Christians only have a Christ who is at the altar, that is, a Christ on the cross. Many hymns speak of the crucified Christ. Some Christians only have a Christ in the Holy Place. The highest attainment in their spiritual seeking is that of a Christ preparing the bread of the Presence, lighting the lamp, and burning the incense in the Holy Place. They have missed the High Priest in the Holy of Holies. The main function of our High Priest today is neither at the altar nor in the Holy Place but in the Holy of Holies, where God&rsquo;s presence and shekinah glory are. Yes, He was once on the cross, but as 1:3 reveals, His work on the cross has been finished. Now, having finished His work, He is sitting at the right hand of God in the heavens. No place is closer to God than this. The book of Hebrews was written to help us come forward to this Christ, who is now in the presence of God.</p>
<p>The Christ who is in the Holy of Holies is not merely our Savior, Redeemer, Apostle, or Captain of salvation; He is our High Priest. In the Holy of Holies He is ministering God into us. We should forget our environment, weaknesses, troubles, and even ourselves and remember that today Jesus Christ is our High Priest in the Holy of Holies. As long as we have such a High Priest, we have everything we need.</p>
<p>According to the Old Testament, whenever the high priest went into the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, he bore upon his shoulders two onyx stones on which were engraved the names of the children of Israel (Exo. 28:9-12). He also wore the breastplate in which were set twelve precious stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel (vv. 15-30). This signifies that the people of Israel were on the shoulder and breast of the high priest. Since the shoulder signifies strength and the breast signifies love, the people of God were on the strength and in the love of the high priest. When the high priest was in the Holy of Holies, he brought all the people of God along with him. In the eyes of God, when he was there, all the people of God were there with him. Likewise, when God looks at Christ, our High Priest in the Holy of Holies, He sees us upon His shoulder and breast. Our High Priest in the Holy of Holies in the heavens bears us and wears us before God. Even now we are upon His shoulder and upon His breast in the Holy of Holies. We are there with Him in the shekinah glory of God.</p>
<p>As Christ bears us before God in the Holy of Holies, He ministers God into our being. When the apostle Paul prayed to the Lord, asking Him to remove the thorn (2 Cor. 12:7-8), the Lord said, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness&rdquo; (v. 9). Instead of removing that thorn, the Lord imparted Himself into Paul as grace, enabling the apostle to know how precious and sufficient He is. This experience of Christ as our High Priest who bears us on His shoulder and breast and ministers God into us is an experience in the Holy of Holies, where we enjoy God Himself and all His riches. When we enter into this experience, it is difficult to say where we are or what is happening. We can only say that we are upon the shoulders and breast of our High Priest and that He is ministering something comforting and strengthening into us. This experience of Christ as our High Priest is the highest experience and enjoyment. We all must learn to stay here on His shoulders and on His breast in the Holy of Holies. We should not be content to remain as outer-court Christians; neither should we be Christians staggering in the Holy Place. We must press on into the Holy of Holies, where God&rsquo;s presence and shekinah glory are.</p>
<p>This experience of Christ as our High Priest undoubtedly is in the heavens. However, it is also in our spirit and in the church because the church today is God&rsquo;s habitation in our spirit. Christ, the heavenly ladder which joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth, is in our spirit. By the habitation of God and the heavenly ladder, the Holy of Holies in the heavens is joined to our spirit. The wonderful Christ is both in the heavens and also in our spirit. Romans 8:34 says that Christ is at the right hand of God interceding for us, and Romans 8:10 says that Christ is also within us. There are not two Christs, one in the heavens and one within us; neither is it a matter of one Christ at two different times. Just as the electricity in the power plant is joined to our homes, so the Christ in the third heaven is joined to our spirit. If by the flow of electricity two places can be made one, how much more can our wonderful Christ be both in the heavens as well as in our spirit!</p><h2 class="head4">a. A Great High Priest of the Good Things<br />
Who Has Passed through the Heavens, Jesus,<br />
the Son of God, Holy, Guileless, Undefiled,<br />
Separated from Sinners, and Having Become Higher Than the Heavens, Perfected Forever</h2>
<p>Hebrews 4:14 says, &ldquo;Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.&rdquo; In this verse the title <em>Jesus</em> refers to His humanity, whereas the title <em>Son of God</em> refers to His Godhead. In 7:26 we are told that Christ is the High Priest, who is holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and having become higher than the heavens. In verse 28 we see that Christ as the Son is perfected forever. Verse 11 of chapter 9 speaks of Christ as a High Priest of the good things; 10:21 speaks of Christ as the great Priest over the house of God. These verses reveal that Christ is a great High Priest of the good things, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, having become higher than the heavens, and perfected forever.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) A Great High Priest</h2>
<p>According to 4:14, Jesus, the Son of God, is a &ldquo;great High Priest.&rdquo; The word <em>great</em> in this verse means &ldquo;excellent, wonderful, glorious, and most honorable.&rdquo; Christ is great in His person (1:5, 8; 2:6), work (1:3; 2:17, 9, 14-15, 10; 3:5-6; 4:8-9; Acts 2:24, 27), and attainment (Heb. 6:20; 9:24; 2:9).</p>
<p>First, our High Priest, Christ, is great in His person. He is the Son of God, God Himself (1:5, 8). He is also the Son of Man, man himself (2:6). He, being both God and man, has the divine nature and the human nature. He not only knows the things of God and the things of man; He also is in the things of God and the things of man. No other high priest has ever been like Him.</p>
<p>Our High Priest, Christ, is also great in His work. He has made purification of and propitiation for our sins (1:3; 2:17). He has taken away sin and has solved the problem of sin. He tasted death not only on behalf of every man but also on behalf of everything (v. 9). By tasting death, He conquered and subdued it. Death could not hold Him (Acts 2:24, 27). He also destroyed the devil who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14). By His death on the cross, Christ annulled Satan, the power of death. By conquering death and destroying the devil, He has released us from the slavery of death (v. 15). We have been freed by Him not only from the slavery of sin but also from the slavery of death. Through His suffering, He has been perfected to be the Captain of our salvation (v. 10). He fought the battle and entered into glory. As the Pioneer, He is leading us on in the same way to glory. He is now taking care of God&rsquo;s house as Moses did (3:5-6). As the Builder of the house, He surely knows how to take care of it. He is now also bringing us into rest, as Joshua did (4:8-9). He has given us the Sabbath rest in the church age, and He will bring us into the Sabbath rest of the kingdom age. As our High Priest, He is great in all these wonderful and excellent works of His, which no high priest in the Old Testament had ever accomplished.</p>
<p>Moreover, our High Priest, Christ, is great in His attainment. His attainment is so high that He entered into the Holy of Holies in the heavens and was crowned with glory and honor (6:20; 9:24; 2:9). He is no longer on earth bearing the crown of thorns; He is now in the highest heavens wearing the crown of glory. No high priest can exceed Him in His attainment; no one can even compare with Him in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Having Passed through the Heavens</h2>
<p>Our High Priest, Christ, who is great in His person, qualification, work, accomplishment, and attainment, has passed through the heavens (4:14). After He was crucified and before He was resurrected, Christ walked through Hades, having a good sightseeing tour. Although Satan and all the powers of death tried to hold Him, at the time of His resurrection, He rose from the grave (Acts 2:24, 27). Later, as He was ascending to the heavens, He overcame the gravitation of earth. The demons desperately tried to prevent Him from leaving the earth, but He made a wonderful takeoff. Then He ascended to the heavens. As He was passing through the air, the evil spirits, the principalities and powers, tried to grasp Him and hold Him back, but He stripped them off, making a display to the whole universe. This is the meaning of Colossians 2:15, which tells us that Christ stripped off the rulers and the authorities and &ldquo;made a display of them openly, triumphing over them.&rdquo; In this verse we see three main points: that Christ stripped off the rulers and the authorities, that He made a display of them, and that He triumphed over them. Now, having risen from Hades, having stripped off the rulers and the authorities, and having passed through the heavens, He is sitting on the throne at the right hand of God, where He is restfully enjoying a Sabbath. But He desires to see that all His members come into His Sabbath rest. The way to enter into His Sabbath is by experiencing Him as our High Priest. We simply need to come forward to the throne of grace on which He is sitting and receive mercy and find grace. When we do this, we are immediately in the Sabbath rest of the church life, waiting with Him for the better Sabbath to come in the age of the millennial kingdom.</p><h2 class="head5">3) Being Holy, Guileless, Undefiled,<br />
Separated from Sinners,<br />
Having Become Higher than the Heavens,<br />
and Being Perfected Forever</h2>
<p>Hebrews 7:26 says that &ldquo;such a High Priest was also fitting to us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners.&rdquo; Christ is holy, guileless, undefiled, and separated from sinners. As such a perfect One, He surely is fitting to us. Having a fallen and corrupted nature, we need such a High Priest to save us all the time.</p>
<p>Verse 26 also says that He has &ldquo;become higher than the heavens.&rdquo; In His ascension, Christ &ldquo;has passed through the heavens&rdquo; (4:14). Now He is not only in heaven (9:24) but also &ldquo;higher than the heavens,&rdquo; &ldquo;far above all the heavens&rdquo; (Eph. 4:10). None of our troubles is higher than the heavens. Because our High Priest is higher than the heavens, He is able to rescue us and save us to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25).</p>
<p>Verse 28 says that the Son of God has been perfected forever. This verse proves that the Son of God must not be simply the only begotten Son but also the firstborn Son. The only begotten Son of God needed no perfection, because He was eternally perfect. But in order for Christ to be the firstborn Son of God, He needed a great deal of perfection. He had to put on humanity in His incarnation and live on earth for thirty-three and a half years, passing through all the experiences of human living. Then He needed to pass through death, tasting, overcoming, subduing, and swallowing up death. After that, He had to come out of death in resurrection. After His resurrection, He, as the firstborn Son of God with humanity, was fully perfected. Now He is not just the eternal only begotten Son of God but also the perfected firstborn Son of God. Therefore, now He is completely perfected, equipped, and qualified to be our divine High Priest. We may trust in Him with our full confidence because He has been so perfected.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Made Like Us in All Things,<br />
Able to Sympathize with Our Weaknesses,<br />
Having Been Tried in All Respects Like Us,<br />
yet without Sin</h2>
<p>Verse 15 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;We do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all respects like us, yet without sin.&rdquo; Verses 17 and 18 of chapter 2 say, &ldquo;Hence He should have been made like His brothers in all things that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in the things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For being tempted in that which He Himself has suffered, He is able to help those who are being tempted.&rdquo; These verses indicate that Christ has been made like us in all things, able to sympathize with our weaknesses, having been tried in all respects like us, yet without sin. Although Christ is so high and capable, He is able to sympathize with our weaknesses. In a very real sense, He is the same as we are in all respects, except that He is without sin.</p>
<p>As our High Priest, Christ has been tried in all respects like us, but without sin (4:15). Since He has been tried, He is qualified and able to help us who are being tried (2:18). In all His trials, He was never stained with sin. He suffered the trials without being touched by sin. He is truly equipped to help us to pass through trials and to keep us from any entanglement of sin.</p>
<p>As the One who has been tried in all respects like us, our High Priest, Christ, is able to sympathize with our weaknesses (4:15). He is easily touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and quickly enters into a fellow-suffering with us in our weaknesses. Whatever happens to us and whatever suffering we may have, He feels it with us and sympathizes with us.</p>
<p>In 5:2 we are told that a high priest was &ldquo;able to exercise compassion toward the ignorant and erring since he also is encompassed with weakness.&rdquo; The Greek in this verse implies a feeling toward the ignorant and erring that is neither too severe nor too tolerant. To exercise compassion is to be moderate or tender in judging their situation. The thought in this verse is a continuation of the thought in 4:15. Though not encompassed with weakness like the high priest taken from among men, Christ as our High Priest was tempted in all respects like us. Hence, being touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, He is able to exercise compassion toward us, the ignorant and erring ones.</p>
<p>Christ can be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses because the ascended, heavenly Christ is still with us and is therefore able to be touched with our feeling. Day by day we have the feeling of weaknesses, of infirmities, of being weak and inadequate. But there is a High Priest who is able to be touched with our feeling. Therefore, He must be One who is not only in the heavens but also with us in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). This is possible because today Christ is not only the ascended Christ in the heavens but also the Spirit in our spirit. Hence, today He is with us.</p>
<p>Christ is a great High Priest who can always be touched with our feeling. Whatever we feel, He feels. He is being touched continually with our feeling, because He is in our spirit. He sympathizes with everything that we feel, because He is one with us. Today we need to appropriate Christ experientially by realizing that the heavenly Christ as the living Spirit dwells in our spirit for us to touch. We must learn how to discern our spirit from the other parts of our being. Then we will meet Christ in our spirit, be in His presence, and experience Him as the High Priest who sympathizes with our feeling all the time.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Having Been Once Offered<br />
to Bear the Sins of Many</h2>
<p>Verse 28 of Hebrews 9 tells us that Christ has been offered once to bear the sins of many (v. 14; 10:12). In the eyes of God, sin is gone and has become history. We should not believe Satan, our feelings, or our failures. They are lies. We must declare that sin was put away by Christ in His first manifestation.</p>
<p>According to 7:27, our High Priest &ldquo;does not have daily need, as the high priests do, to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then for those of the people; for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.&rdquo; This does not refer to what Christ is doing today but to what He did in the past. This verse assures us that never again need we be bothered by sin, for Christ offered Himself for sins once for all. On the cross He solved the problem of sin once for all. Now on the throne, He is carrying out His priesthood forever.</p>
<p>Christ offered Himself to God for our sins (7:27; 9:14, 26; 10:10, 12). The first thing that our Lord did in His priestly ministry was to offer Himself to God for our sins. He was the real sin offering, the unique sin offering. From the foundation of the world, Christ was the unique sin offering (Rev. 13:8). As such an offering, He offered Himself to God for our sins. Christ offered Himself to God for our sins once for all, and He does not need to do it again. It was accomplished once for all for eternity.</p>
<p>We all must declare and announce the good tidings that the problem of sin has been solved. We should not listen to lies. Even our experience is a lie. Sin is no longer here. We all must declare that sin has been taken away. Christ&rsquo;s offering of Himself put away sin. Thus, John 1:29 says, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; However, many Christians do not realize or believe that sin has been taken away. We should believe that sin has been taken away. Even if we have a failure or defeat, we must tell Satan that we do not believe him and that we believe the holy Word, which says that sin has been taken away. We must forget our experiences and what we are, strongly take the Lord&rsquo;s word, and declare to the enemy and to the whole universe that sin has been taken away and that sin has nothing to do with us any longer because Christ offered Himself to God to take it away.</p>
<p>Aaron, as the high priest, took care of things pertaining to God on behalf of the people (Heb. 5:1). Christ is superior to him in taking care of the people&rsquo;s cases before God. Aaron offered both gifts and sacrifices for sins in type for the people and for himself (vv. 1, 3), but Christ offered Himself as the sacrifice for sin in reality.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Not Glorifying Himself in Becoming a High Priest but Being Called by God, Even as Aaron Also Was</h2>
<p>Verses 4 and 5 say, &ldquo;No one takes the honor upon himself, but only as he is called by God, just as Aaron also was. So also Christ did not glorify Himself in becoming a High Priest, but it was He who said to Him, &lsquo;You are My Son; this day have I begotten You.&rsquo;&rdquo; Christ did not glorify Himself to become a High Priest but was called by God, even as Aaron was.</p>
<p>Aaron did not take honor unto himself but was called and established by God to be the high priest (vv. 4, 1). This is even more true with Christ. He did not glorify Himself to become a High Priest; He was ordained by God in His resurrection, according to the order of Melchizedek (vv. 5-6).</p>
<p>As the High Priest, Christ was glorified through resurrection. In verse 5 the word <em>glorify</em> replaces <em>honor</em> used in the foregoing verse. With the high priest taken from among men, there is only honor, a matter of position. With Christ as the High Priest, there is not only honor but also glory, not only the preciousness of His position but also the splendor of His person.</p>
<p>Verse 5 contains a quotation from Psalm 2:7, saying, &ldquo;You are My Son; this day have I begotten You.&rdquo; This refers to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Acts 13:33), which qualifies Him to be our High Priest. For Christ to be our High Priest, He had to partake of our humanity, as mentioned in Hebrews 2:14-18, and enter with this humanity into resurrection. In His humanity He can be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and be merciful to us (4:15; 2:17). In resurrection, in His divinity He can do everything for us and be faithful to us (7:24-25; 2:17).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(79)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the One better than Aaron.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. According to the Order of Melchizedek,<br />
according to the Power of an Indestructible Life,<br />
by the Taking of an Oath</h2>
<p>According to Hebrews 5:6, God says to Christ, &ldquo;You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo; Verse 10 speaks of Christ &ldquo;being addressed by God as a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo; Hebrews 7:20-21 say of Christ, &ldquo;Inasmuch as He was not made a Priest without the taking of an oath (for they are appointed priests without the taking of an oath, but He, with the taking of an oath by Him who said to Him, &lsquo;The Lord has sworn and will not regret it, You are a Priest forever&rsquo;).&rdquo; These verses reveal that Christ is a High Priest different from Aaron in three respects: He is a priest according to the order of Melchizedek, according to the power of an indestructible life, and by the taking of an oath.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) According to the Order of Melchizedek</h2>
<p>Hebrews 5:6, a quotation from Psalm 110, says, &ldquo;You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo; This refers to Christ in His ascension and enthronement (Psa. 110:1-4), which, in addition to His resurrection, are further qualifications for Him to be our High Priest (Heb. 7:26). Christ is our High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek. The order of Melchizedek is higher than the order of Aaron. The order of Aaron was for the priesthood only in humanity, whereas the order of Melchizedek is for the priesthood in both humanity and divinity.</p>
<p>In the Bible the order of Melchizedek came sequentially before that of Aaron. The priesthood of Melchizedek did not come in with Abraham&rsquo;s descendants but with Abraham himself. The priesthood which came to Abraham was not that which is according to the order of Aaron but that which is according to the order of Melchizedek. Melchizedek met Abraham with bread and wine, and Abraham gave him tithes (Gen. 14:18-20). However, Melchizedek did not come to Abraham to receive tithes from him but to minister to him the bread and wine.</p>
<p>One night, before He left His disciples, the Lord Jesus ministered to them the bread and wine (Matt. 26:26-28). The Bible is wonderfully consistent. Melchizedek ministered bread and wine to Abraham, and the Lord Jesus ministered bread and wine to His disciples. Partaking of the Lord&rsquo;s table is related to Christ&rsquo;s priesthood according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>What is the significance of the bread and wine used at the Lord&rsquo;s table? The Lord Himself said of the bread, &ldquo;This is My body&rdquo; (v. 26), and of the wine, &ldquo;This is My blood&rdquo; (v. 28). This indicates that the bread and wine on the table portray Christ who, as the embodiment of God, has been processed that He might be ministered into us.</p>
<p>When Christians think of Christ as their High Priest, very few refer to Genesis 14. Hebrews 7 refers us to Genesis 14, the time when Melchizedek, king of righteousness and king of peace, met Abraham after the slaughter of the kings. Although Melchizedek was a king, he did not come as a king but as the priest of the Most High God, coming to Abraham with bread and wine. In the Bible bread denotes the life supply. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (John 6:35), meaning that He is the bread from heaven which gives us life. In the Bible wine signifies the blood, which accomplishes redemption in order to quench our thirst. As fallen people, we are under God&rsquo;s condemnation. We are thirsty because the fire of righteous judgment burns within us. Since our thirst comes from being under God&rsquo;s condemnation, water cannot quench it. Our thirst can be quenched only by some liquid of life. Wine is not water; it is a life liquid extracted from grapes, which are of life. The Lord Jesus chose wine to signify His redeeming blood, saying, &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Matt. 26:27-28). Melchizedek&rsquo;s coming to minister the bread and wine to Abraham, the father of the called race, signifies Christ&rsquo;s coming to minister Himself as the processed God into us. He was processed on the cross that He might be our life supply with the redeeming wine to quench our thirst under God&rsquo;s condemnation. He is the redeeming God imparting Himself into us for our supply and satisfaction.</p>
<p>When the priests according to the order of Aaron are mentioned in the Bible, we are told that they were chosen and called to offer the sacrifices for sin, not to minister bread and wine to the people. They mainly ministered to God by offering Him gifts and sacrifices for sin. The priesthood according to the order of Aaron took care of God&rsquo;s people mainly in a negative way. But the high priest according to the order of Melchizedek did something more. He did not go to God with the sacrifices for sin; he came from God with bread and wine.</p>
<p>At the time of the passover, the blood was applied and the unleavened bread was eaten (Exo. 12:13-22). The bread and wine ministered to us are the issue of the passover. This means that Christ as our High Priest today ministers into us that which has come out of His redemption. He died for us, sacrificing His body and shedding His blood. All this was accomplished before He went back to God the Father. According to the book of Hebrews, Christ offered Himself as the unique sacrifice for sin and solved the problem of sin once for all (9:26, 28). Then He brought His blood into the Holy of Holies in the heavens and sprinkled it in the presence of God, thereby accomplishing redemption (v. 12). Now, as far as redemption is concerned, Christ has nothing more to do. He is sitting on the right hand of God (1:3). However, He still needs to be our High Priest, not to go to God but to come to us. He does not come to us to deal with our sins but to minister the bread and wine, which signify Himself who, for our supply and satisfaction, was processed through death and resurrection. This surpasses redemption.</p>
<p>Most Christians today dwell on Christ as their Redeemer and Savior, the One who shed His blood for them, offered Himself for them, and made propitiation for their sins that God might be appeased on their behalf. But the book of Hebrews goes further than this. It unveils Christ who no longer is only a Redeemer offering the sacrifice for sin to God and shedding His blood for our sins. The Christ revealed in this book is also the One who, after accomplishing redemption, comes to us in a mysterious way in our spirit. He does not come as our Redeemer but as our High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek. He does not come to offer anything on our behalf but to minister Himself to us in the form of bread and wine as our daily supply and our satisfaction. Many Christians are weak because they do not have much experience of Christ ministering Himself into them as the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</p><h2 class="head5">2) According to the Power of an Indestructible Life</h2>
<p>Christ has not been constituted the High Priest according to the powerless letters of the law but according to the powerful element of an indestructible life (7:16). Nothing can dissolve this life. It is an endless life, being the eternal, divine, uncreated, resurrection life that has passed through the test of death and Hades (Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18). It is by such a life that Christ ministers today as our High Priest. Hence, He is able to save us to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25). Christ as our High Priest is the living Son of God Himself. As the powerful One, Christ is simultaneously both in heaven and in our spirit. Between these two ends, heaven and our spirit, there is the traffic on the heavenly ladder because His priesthood is continually flowing from the throne into our spirit. It does not flow with knowledge but with the power of an indestructible life.</p>
<p>In Christ, our High Priest, not only is there no worldliness or sin, but there is absolutely no death. Death has been completely swallowed up by His divine life. Christ lives forever (Rev. 1:18). Death cannot prevent Him from continuing as the High Priest. All of the Levitical priests lived until a certain age and then died. Death prevented them from continuing as priests. After the first high priest died, he was replaced by the second who, in turn, was replaced by the third, because death prevented them from continuing in the office of high priest. Not only were those priests unable to save others; they were unable to save even themselves. Christ&rsquo;s priesthood is different. While the Aaronic priesthood was still subject to death, the priesthood according to the order of Melchizedek, constituted with the element of life, is the absence of death. The life with which it is constituted has passed through death and has swallowed up death. This life is indestructible.</p>
<p>We know that this life is indestructible because it has been tested by everything and by every kind of situation. It was tested by the Lord&rsquo;s mother in the flesh, by all the members of His fleshly family, by all the sufferings of His human life, and by all the temptations of the devil, Satan. Ultimately, it was tested by death, the grave, Hades, and the power of darkness. This life has been tested by everything, and nothing can destroy it. It is absolutely indestructible. Our High Priest is constituted with the element of such an indestructible life.</p>
<p>This wonderful High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek has not been constituted &ldquo;according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life&rdquo; (Heb. 7:16), for &ldquo;the law perfected nothing&rdquo; (v. 19). In verse 16 there are two sources: the law and the life. The law is on the side of the tree of knowledge, and the life is on the side of the tree of life. Since the law did not perfect anything, we need to stay away from the law. Our High Priest has not been constituted with the law but with the power of an indestructible life. We have this life, the life that is the Son of God Himself.</p>
<p>Aaron was constituted high priest according to the powerless letter of the law; Christ was constituted according to the powerful element of an indestructible life. In other words, Aaron and all the priests according to the order of Aaron served according to the outward rules and regulations, but today Christ as our High Priest ministers according to the power of an indestructible life. He works not according to the regulations of the letter but according to the power of an indestructible life. Our High Priest is constituted of a life that nothing can conquer but rather conquers everything. It is a life that cannot be destroyed, a life that saves to the uttermost. It is the resurrection life, which has passed the test of death and Hades.</p>
<p>According to the type in the Old Testament, God&rsquo;s people were weak and sinful, under the conviction that they could do nothing to please God. When they came to the priests, the priests did something according to the regulations written in the books of Moses to help the weak and sinful ones, to care for them so that they could be reconciled to God. Today Christ is our High Priest. If we are under the conviction that we are sinful, weak, wrong, and doing things against God, Christ as our High Priest sympathizes with us and cares for us, not according to rules and regulations in letter but by the power of an indestructible life within. This is not an objective matter but a subjective one. The power of an indestructible life is the eternal Spirit, and the eternal Spirit is the reality of resurrection. The eternal Spirit is the power of the indestructible life. In acting as our High Priest, Christ cares for our case by this power.</p>
<p>Many times we may be disappointed by our weakness, circumstances, and failures. However, we sense and experience that there is a living power within us, sustaining us, taking care of us, and reconciling us to God to bridge the gap between God and us. This is not by outward regulations or rules but by something living and powerful within. There is something living and powerful within us, taking care of our case. This is our High Priest taking care of us by the power of an indestructible life, which is transmitted from the heavens into our spirit.</p>
<p>Christ, our High Priest, is actively taking care of our case in the heavens and transmitting Himself into our spirit. There is no need for us to worry about anything. We must come simply and boldly to the throne of grace to contact Him, to look to Him, to receive mercy, and to find grace for timely help. We must learn to contact Him in our spirit and see the heavenly &ldquo;television.&rdquo; Then we will receive mercy and find grace. He is such a High Priest according to the heavenly order to minister the life supply to us, according to the power of an indestructible life, not merely to redeem us, reconcile us, and deal with our sins but also to minister into us the heavenly life supply, the heavenly power, the heavenly strength, and the heavenly riches, as Melchizedek did to Abraham.</p><h2 class="head5">3) By the Taking of an Oath</h2>
<p>As the only begotten Son and the firstborn Son of God, Christ became the High Priest with the taking of an oath by God (vv. 20-21, 28). Not one of the Levitical priests was ever established by God&rsquo;s oath. According to Psalm 110, God swore to make Christ a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek. In Hebrews 7 the writer quotes that oath from Psalm 110. This is very weighty, proving that Christ&rsquo;s becoming the divine High Priest was consummated by God&rsquo;s oath.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. Though He Was the Son,<br />
He Learning Obedience from the Things<br />
Which He Suffered; and Having Been Perfected,<br />
He Becoming to All Those Who Obey Him<br />
the Source of Eternal Salvation</h2>
<p>Hebrews 5:8-9 says of Christ, &ldquo;Even though He was a Son, learned obedience from the things which He suffered. And having been perfected, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation.&rdquo; God ordained that Christ should die, and Christ obeyed (Phil. 2:8). He learned this obedience through the suffering of death. Although in His divinity Christ was the Son of God, in His humanity He learned obedience through His sufferings. Having been perfected, He became to all those who obey Him the source, the Author, of eternal salvation.</p>
<p>The eternal salvation that we have in Christ (Heb. 5:9) is based upon the eternal redemption He accomplished for us (9:12), which is much better than the temporary atonement carried out by the priests according to the order of Aaron. That temporary atonement covered sin but never put it away, whereas Christ&rsquo;s eternal redemption put away sin, solving the problem of sin forever. Furthermore, Christ&rsquo;s eternal salvation is not merely an objective redemption to solve our problem of sin on the negative side but also a subjective salvation to save us into His perfection and glorification on the positive side. Such an eternal salvation is not limited by time and space but is all-embracing with the divine element and nature. The divine element and nature of Christ are the basic constituents of His eternal salvation, which not only saves us from the most negative things but also saves us into the most positive things, even into God Himself. Such a saving is all-embracing, not limited by time and space.</p>
<p>The person of Christ as our High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek is the source of our eternal salvation (5:6-10). As long as such a One is with us, we could never be weak. He is the source of eternal salvation, of which all the effects, benefits, and issues are of an eternal nature, transcending the conditions and limitations of time and space. Although we have Christ as the Captain of our salvation in Hebrews 2, we do not have the source of eternal salvation until we come to Christ as our High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek in Hebrews 5. Our Christ is not only today&rsquo;s Joshua; He is also our eternal Melchizedek. As our Joshua, the Captain of salvation, He takes the lead, and we follow Him. As our Melchizedek, the source of eternal salvation, He ministers Himself to us as bread and wine, and we eat and drink of Him. When our Melchizedek comes to us, He does not come with demands or requirements; He comes with bread and wine. When we are tired, He is our bread. When we are thirsty, He is our wine. We need to eat Him, drink Him, and enjoy Him for our supply. Whenever we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we declare to the whole universe that we live by eating the divine bread and by drinking the divine wine as our daily supply. This is our way of living. May we all be helped to see that the table symbolizes that our Christ today is our Melchizedek who ministers to us the bread and the wine. This is the source of our salvation.</p>
<p>Christ was perfected to be our High Priest through His sufferings (vv. 8-10). In His eternal salvation, we need to experience Him in His sufferings. When we experience Him in His sufferings, we will be saved into His perfection. This experience of Christ in His suffering for perfection is by our enjoying Him as our High Priest.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(80)</h1>
<p>In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the One better than Aaron.</p>
<h2 class="head4">g. As Melchizedek, He Being:</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 7 we see that Christ as the High Priest is typified by Melchizedek. According to Genesis 14, after Abraham defeated God&rsquo;s enemies, Melchizedek came to meet Abraham, bringing out bread and wine. At the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, Christ as Melchizedek comes to us with the processed Triune God as bread and wine for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) The Priest of the Most High God</h2>
<p>Hebrews 7:1 speaks of Melchizedek as &ldquo;priest of the Most High God.&rdquo; Melchizedek is a type of Christ as the Priest of the Most High God. In Psalm 110 we are told that God&rsquo;s anointed One, the Christ, is the Priest according to the order of Melchizedek (v. 4), an order which is prior to that of Aaron. Before Aaron came into the priesthood, Melchizedek was already God&rsquo;s priest.</p>
<p>The Aaronic priesthood dealt with sin, taking care of things on the negative side. The ministry of Melchizedek, on the contrary, is positive. Melchizedek did not come in to take away sin. He did not appear because Abraham had sinned but because Abraham had gained the victory. Melchizedek did not appear with an offering to take away sin but with bread and wine to nourish the victor. Nearly all Christians consider Christ as the High Priest who takes care of sin, but hardly anyone pays attention to Christ as the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek. As such a High Priest, Christ does not take care of sin but ministers to us the processed God, signified by the bread and wine, as our nourishment.</p>
<p>After Abraham gained the victory, Melchizedek appeared. Before his appearing, Melchizedek, a priest of God, must have been interceding for Abraham. It must have been through his intercession that Abraham was able to slaughter the four kings and gain the victory (cf. Exo. 17:8-13). Today Christ, our High Priest, is interceding for us in a hidden way (Rom. 8:34b; Heb. 7:25b) that we may be His overcomers to defeat God&rsquo;s enemies so that through our victory Christ can be manifested openly in His second coming. Today we all need to echo the Lord&rsquo;s intercession. If we turn to our spirit and contact Him, forgetting our environment, enemies, and even ourselves, we will echo His intercession, gain the victory, and slaughter the kings.</p>
<p>Melchizedek&rsquo;s coming to Abraham was an indication of Christ&rsquo;s second coming. What are we, today&rsquo;s Abraham, doing here? We are slaughtering the enemies. Some of God&rsquo;s people, like Lot, have suffered defeat after defeat. By God&rsquo;s mercy, some others need to be today&rsquo;s Abraham who experience victory after victory. We need to learn the basic lesson that our God, the One who called us, is the Possessor of heaven and earth. We are living for Him on the earth, and we are His testimony. We should not tolerate any damage to God&rsquo;s interest on earth. When we hear of such damage, we need to defeat the enemy and to slaughter the kings.</p>
<p>We need to slaughter some kings daily. We need to slaughter the kings in our mind, emotion, and will. We need to slaughter the kings in our environment, families, and schools. After we have finished our slaughter of the kings, our Melchizedek will come to us, meet with us, and celebrate our victory. The Lord will not come back until we have slaughtered all the kings. Then He will return and drink the fruit of the vine with us, as indicated by His word in Matthew 26:29: &ldquo;I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father.&rdquo; Melchizedek interceded for Lot and Abraham. Today Christ, our High Priest, is interceding for all the overcoming ones. While He is now interceding for us in heaven, we are slaughtering the kings on earth. After the overcoming ones slaughter all the kings, our Intercessor, the High Priest of the Most High God, will appear with the full taste of the processed God.</p>
<p>Melchizedek&rsquo;s coming signified that Christ had come. Our victory always makes Christ manifested. The people in our environment may find it difficult to see where Christ is. However, if we gain a victory, that victory will declare Christ to them. Our victory will bring in Christ in a new way. It is interesting to see that in chapter 14 of Genesis Melchizedek, whose name means the king of righteousness and who was the king of Salem, which means the king of peace, suddenly appeared. This signifies that Christ will be declared to people and brought to them by the overcoming ones. One day the whole earth will be surprised by Christ&rsquo;s appearing. The people in the world do not even believe that there is a Christ, calling such belief nonsense. But after we have slaughtered all the kings, Christ will suddenly appear. Christ will be made manifest by our slaughter of the kings, and the whole world will be surprised at His coming. To the overcomers, Christ&rsquo;s second appearing will not be a surprise, but to the worldly people it will be a great surprise. They may ask who this One is, what His name is, and where He comes from. The overcomers may answer by declaring that His name is Christ, the real Melchizedek, and that He comes from the heavens where He has been interceding for centuries.</p>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s victory in chapter 14 is not insignificant. When Melchizedek came to Abraham, he not only blessed Abraham with the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth (v. 19) but also blessed God for Abraham&rsquo;s victory (v. 20). Our victory always causes our Melchizedek to grant us blessing and to give blessing to God. Our victory brings in more blessings in Christ, both to us and to God. Having the qualifications of His divinity and His resurrected life, Christ as the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek is able to minister the processed God with the divine blessing, not to sinners but to those who fight for God&rsquo;s interest, as Abraham did (vv. 18-20).</p>
<p>At Melchizedek&rsquo;s blessing, Abraham gave him tithes of all, the tithes of his choice spoils (v. 20; Heb. 7:2, 4). This also proves Melchizedek&rsquo;s greatness. Our victory gains the spoils, and the offering of our spoils to Christ always declares the greatness of Christ. Without victory, we have nothing to offer to Christ, and His greatness will not be declared.</p>
<p>At the end of our slaughter of all the kings, our Melchizedek will appear to us. That will be the second coming of Christ. When Christ comes in, the whole earth will know the Most High God. Then all the earth will realize that God is the Possessor of heaven and earth. The earth is not possessed by any king, president, statesman, or politician; it is possessed by the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth. This fact can be declared to the earth only by our slaughter of the kings.</p><h2 class="head5">2) The King of Righteousness and the King of Peace</h2>
<p>According to verse 2, Melchizedek is interpreted as the &ldquo;king of righteousness,&rdquo; and he is mentioned as the &ldquo;king of Salem, which is king of peace.&rdquo; As Melchizedek, Christ is not only a Priest but also a King; hence, He is a kingly, royal Priest.</p>
<p>Melchizedek was a king, and his name means the king of righteousness. According to Isaiah 32:1 we see that the title <em>king of righteousness</em> also refers to the Lord Jesus. Christ is the King of righteousness, today&rsquo;s Melchizedek. As the King of righteousness, Christ has made all things right with God and with one another. He has reconciled man to God and has appeased God for man. Righteousness issues in peace (v. 17). By His righteousness Christ has brought forth the fruit of peace.</p>
<p>Melchizedek was also the king of Salem, which means the king of peace, signifying that Christ is also the King of peace (9:6). As the King of peace through righteousness, Christ has brought in peace between God and us. In peace He fulfills the ministry of His priesthood, ministering God to us for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>The first time that the Bible speaks of the priesthood, it tells of a wonderful person who was the king of peace. The second aspect of his title is that of the king of righteousness. If we do not have righteousness, we cannot have peace, because peace always comes from righteousness. With Melchizedek there was both righteousness and peace. Based upon this righteousness and peace, he ministered the bread and wine to Abraham. Our basis for coming to the Lord&rsquo;s table is neither pity nor mercy; it is righteousness and peace. According to Romans 3, 4, and 5, righteousness has been reckoned to us, and we have been justified. As a result, we enjoy peace. Romans 3 and 4 give us righteousness and justification, and Romans 5 gives us peace under righteousness. Based upon this righteousness and peace, we may enjoy the bread and the wine at the Lord&rsquo;s table. The One who brought in righteousness and peace is the One who ministers the bread and wine to us. He is our High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>Neither Aaron nor any of his descendants were ever a king. They were only priests. They were not of the kingly tribe but of the priestly tribe. The kingly tribe was the tribe of Judah, and the priestly tribe was the tribe of Levi. Christ came out of the tribe of Judah (Heb. 7:13-14). Thus, we should not rank Him with Aaron, for He does not belong to Aaron&rsquo;s tribe. Christ is a kingly Priest.</p>
<p>Christ is the High Priest, but His status is that of a King. As He functions as a Priest, He is a King. He is the King to be the Priest; so His priesthood is kingly, royal (1 Pet. 2:9). He combines the kingship together with the priesthood (Zech. 6:13) for God&rsquo;s building and for His glory. Christ&rsquo;s kingship maintains a peaceful order through righteousness. This peaceful order is necessary for God&rsquo;s building. The building of God&rsquo;s house is in a situation of peace. Christ&rsquo;s priesthood ministers all the supply needed for the building of God. In this His glory is manifested.</p>
<p>A priest who offers sacrifices for pitiful sinners does not need to be a king. In order to be such a priest, one does not need to be a king of righteousness or a king of peace. But in order for the High Priest to minister the processed God to a victorious fighter, He must be both the King of righteousness and the King of peace.</p>
<p>In Genesis 14:20 Melchizedek said, &ldquo;Blessed be God the Most High, / Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.&rdquo; We should not think that Abraham himself was able to slaughter Chedorlaomer and the other kings, who took Lot, Abraham&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s son, and his possessions. According to Genesis 14:22, before Abraham went out to fight the battle, he lifted up his hand to the Most High God. This means that before he fought with the enemies, he contacted God. Therefore, it was not Abraham who slaughtered the enemies but God.</p>
<p>When Abraham lifted up his hand to God, the situation was without righteousness and peace. There was no righteousness because Lot and all of his possessions had been captured by the enemies. There was no peace because the enemies had not been defeated. But as Abraham went out to fight the battle, he trusted in God. After Abraham had slaughtered the enemies and Melchizedek had come to meet him, there was righteousness and peace. Melchizedek, the priest of the Most High God, brought in this righteousness and peace. As we previously pointed out, while Abraham was slaughtering Chedorlaomer and the other kings, Melchizedek must have been praying. It must have been through his intercession that righteousness and peace were brought in. The Most High God answered Melchizedek&rsquo;s prayers and delivered Abraham&rsquo;s enemies into his hands. After this intercession and Abraham&rsquo;s victory, Melchizedek appeared.</p>
<p>The Christ who ministers as the High Priest is the interceding One. As we are fighting during the day, slaughtering the negative things, Christ, the High Priest, is interceding for us (Heb. 7:25). At the end of the day, when we have finished our fighting and He has finished His interceding, He comes to us with bread and wine to have an enjoyable time with us. This is our High Priest. While the victor was fighting, Melchizedek was watching and interceding. He saw Abraham&rsquo;s victory and knew when to come with the bread and wine. The ministering Melchizedek must also have been the interceding high priest. This is the kind of High Priest that we have today in Christ.</p>
<p>Before our Melchizedek ministers the processed God to us, He intercedes for us, praying that we may take up our sword and slaughter the enemies. We must slaughter the self, the natural mind, the wild emotion, the stubborn will, and other enemies. While we are slaughtering the enemies, He is interceding for us. After we have finished our slaughtering, He will change His interceding to the ministering of bread and wine. The proper Christian life is to slaughter the enemies during the day and to enjoy the ministry of our Melchizedek with the bread and wine in the evening. At the end of every day, when the slaughtering and interceding have been accomplished, He and we, we and He, may have an enjoyable time enjoying the bread and wine in righteousness and peace.</p>
<p>Melchizedek was the king of righteousness and the king of peace. After he came, there was righteousness and peace. It was in such an environment and condition of righteousness and peace that Melchizedek ministered the bread and wine to the victor. It is the same today. We need to fight for righteousness, and righteousness will issue in peace. Eventually our environment and condition will be full of righteousness and peace, and our Melchizedek will appear to have an enjoyable time with us. This is the ministry of our kingly High Priest.</p>
<p>We have righteousness and peace, but righteousness and peace alone cannot satisfy us; we need something to eat and drink. We need our daily supply. Thus, based upon God&rsquo;s righteousness and peace, our Melchizedek ministers the bread and wine for us to eat and drink. He has redeemed us, and now He feeds us.</p>
<p>While the Aaronic priesthood solves the problem of sin, the kingly priesthood ministers God to us, as our enjoyment for our daily supply. When we mention God, we must think of Him as the One who has been processed and imparted to us to be our daily supply. There is no better worship to God than enjoying Him as our supply. The more we eat and drink of God, the more worship we render to Him. Eating and drinking of God are the best worship. The worship that satisfies God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire to the uttermost is that we enjoy Him as our supply.</p>
<p>That man should eat and drink of God was the original and initial intention of God in His eternal plan (Gen. 2:9-10). In God&rsquo;s eternal plan, God intended to dispense Himself into man to be man&rsquo;s everything so that man might become His complete expression. This intention can be accomplished only by Christ&rsquo;s kingly priesthood, which ministers the processed God to us as our daily supply. However, before this was accomplished, sin came in. Therefore, the problem of sin had to be solved. But solving the problem of sin was not the way God originally intended to fulfill His eternal purpose; instead, it was added later due to the entrance of sin caused by the fall of man. Because of man&rsquo;s fall, sin came in to frustrate and damage God&rsquo;s purpose of ministering Himself into man as man&rsquo;s daily supply. Since Satan had brought in sin to frustrate God&rsquo;s purpose, the problem of sin had to be solved. Hence, there was the need of the Aaronic priesthood, which was brought in to solve the problem of sin. By this we can see that the Aaronic priesthood was not a part of God&rsquo;s initial intention but was added later. Many Christians, forgetting the initial things and concentrating on what was added later, neglect the kingly priesthood and concentrate on the Aaronic priesthood. The Aaronic priesthood solves the problem of sin, whereas the kingly priesthood fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. The Aaronic priesthood took away sin, and the kingly priesthood brought in God as our grace.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) Without Father, without Mother, without Genealogy, Having neither Beginning of Days nor End of Life,<br />
Abiding a Priest Perpetually</h2>
<p>Christ as our kingly High Priest is perpetual, eternal, without beginning or ending. Hebrews 7:3 says that Melchizedek is &ldquo;without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.&rdquo; This shows that the order of Christ&rsquo;s priesthood is eternal, being neither established nor chosen by men but by God.</p>
<p>Unlike us, Christ is presented as One who has no human father or mother, no genealogy, no beginning of days or end of life. According to Genesis 14, Melchizedek suddenly appeared and then disappeared. He seems to have had no coming or going, no beginning of days or end of life. Because our Melchizedek is eternal, He has no genealogy.</p>
<p>For all the important persons in Genesis, except Melchizedek, there is a genealogy. In the divine writing, the Holy Spirit sovereignly gave no account of the beginning of Melchizedek&rsquo;s days or of the end of his life, that he might be a proper type of Christ as the eternal One, as our perpetual High Priest. This corresponds with the presentation of the Son of God in the Gospel of John. Being eternal, the Son of God has no genealogy (John 1:1), but as the Son of Man, Christ does have a genealogy (Matt. 1:1-17; Luke 3:23-38).</p>
<p>Christ abides a priest perpetually. This means that He will be a priest continuously and forever. He is the perpetual One, the constant One, the eternal One, having no beginning of days or end of life. He abides the High Priest perpetually.</p>
<h2 class="head5">4) Greater Than Abraham</h2>
<p>According to Hebrews 7:4-7, Christ is greater than Abraham. &ldquo;Consider how great this one was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the choice spoils. And they of the sons of Levi, who received the priestly service, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham. But he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises. But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our High Priest, Christ, is great. He is much greater than Aaron and all the Levitical priests. He was also greater than Abraham. This is proved by the fact that Abraham gave tithes of the choice spoils to Melchizedek (vv. 4, 6; Gen. 14:20). When Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek, the Levitical priests, who as descendants of Abraham were in his loins, also paid tithes to him. Therefore, all the Levitical priests are lesser than Melchizedek, and the order of Aaron is inferior to that of Melchizedek.</p>
<p>Melchizedek blessed Abraham (Heb. 7:6), and this also indicates the greatness of Melchizedek. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;Without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.&rdquo; He was greater than Abraham, and he blessed him with God as the blessing (Gen. 14:19).</p>
<p>Although Christ is a descendant of Abraham, He is greater than Abraham. This is indicated by the Lord&rsquo;s words to the Jews in John 8:58: &ldquo;Before Abraham came into being, I am.&rdquo; Christ as the great I Am is the eternal, ever-existing God. He was before Abraham and is greater than Abraham (v. 53). Before Abraham was, Christ was there already. Christ is not old, but He is ancient. As our Melchizedek, Christ is more ancient and greater than Abraham. Hence, He is greater than all the Aaronic priests.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head4">h. Able to Save to the Uttermost<br />
Those Who Come Forward to God through Him,<br />
Seeing He Is Always Living to Intercede for Them</h2>
<p>Hebrews 7:25 tells us that Christ &ldquo;is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them.&rdquo; Here the expression <em>to the uttermost</em> means &ldquo;completely, entirely, perfectly, to the end, and for eternity.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ as our High Priest is able to save to the fullest extent, that is, to save in every kind of situation and condition.</p>
<p>He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for us. Christ as our High Priest undertakes our case by interceding for us. He appears before God on our behalf and prays for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. We should believe that Christ is always interceding for us. By interceding for us, He takes care of us. He can take care of us much better than we could ever take care of ourselves. Most of the time we are foolish in the way that we care for ourselves. Instead of trying to take care of ourselves by our own efforts, we should simply give ourselves to Him and rest, knowing that He is always caring for us.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Being Able to Save to the Uttermost</h2>
<p>Verse 25 tells us that Christ is able to save to the uttermost. Because He lives forever without any change, Christ is able to save us to the uttermost in extent, in time, and in space. Hence, His salvation reaches to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Christ can save us to the uttermost because He is living not only in the heavens but also within us. While He is living in the heavens, He is transmitting Himself into us. He is living in the heavens to intercede for us and take care of our case, but the reality of this is transmitted into our spirit by His Spirit. We must learn to see this heavenly vision and enjoy our High Priest. Then we will receive mercy and find grace at the throne of grace for timely help. We will be delivered and saved to the uttermost. This is the work of our divine High Priest.</p>
<p>Because He has this kind of priesthood, He is able to save us to the uttermost. If we are not saved to the uttermost, it does not mean that He is not able to save. Rather, it means that we were not willing to be saved. We have no excuse. If we are willing to be saved, surely He will save us to the uttermost.</p>
<p>According to the Scriptures, there are three aspects of the priesthood: the aspect of the Aaronic priesthood, the aspect of the kingly priesthood, and the aspect of the divine priesthood. The Aaronic aspect of the priesthood is for offering sacrifices to God for our sins. Hence, the Aaronic priesthood is mainly concerned with the sin offering. The kingly aspect of the priesthood is for ministering the processed God to us as our life supply. The aspect of the divine priesthood is for saving us to the uttermost. Therefore, we have three words to describe the three aspects of the priesthood: <em>offering</em> for the Aaronic aspect, <em>ministering</em> for the kingly aspect, and <em>saving</em> for the divine aspect. Offering solves the problem of sin, ministering imparts the processed God to us as our daily supply, and saving rescues us to the uttermost. The saving of the divine priesthood rescues us especially from death and all the environment of death.</p>
<p>At this point, we need to consider why there is the need for the third aspect of the priesthood, the divine priesthood. Although sin is over, it caused a tremendous result&mdash;death. According to Romans 5, the issue of sin is death (v. 12). We should not understand death according to the narrow view of our human concept. According to the broadest understanding of death in the Bible, death includes vanity, corruption, sighing, groaning, and decay. Everything is decaying. We may have a strong body, but before too long it begins to decay. The matters of vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay are fully developed and covered in Romans 8. In Romans 5 we have sin and death; in Romans 8 we have vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay. The whole universe has been polluted by death, which is the result of the sin that came in through Adam, the head of the old creation. The pollution that comes from death is corruption, vanity, decay, and groaning. Romans 8:22 says that the whole creation is groaning. Every person is groaning deep within. Since people want to escape from this groaning, they partake of worldly entertainments. Even after indulging in these entertainments, they find that the inward groaning is still there. This groaning is one of the issues of death.</p>
<p>Because of the issues of death, we need the divine priesthood, which is the presence of life and the absence of death. He will save us from all our corruption, vanity, groaning, and decay. When others come to our home, there should be praising, reality, building up, and growth, not groaning, vanity, corruption, and decay. To be saved from these issues of death is what it means to be saved to the uttermost. This is more than the saving of the Savior&mdash;it is the saving of the divine priesthood.</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;uttermost&rdquo; in Hebrews 7:25 has the same root as the Greek word for <em>perfection.</em> Hence, to be saved to the uttermost means to be saved into perfection. Christ saves us into His perfection. To be saved to the uttermost is to be brought into Christ&rsquo;s perfection. The Son of God was incarnated, lived on earth, passed through death, was resurrected, and has been fully perfected forever. This means that in His perfection there is no groaning, vanity, corruption, bondage, or decay. In Christ, the perfected Son of God, the One who has been resurrected and uplifted, there is no groaning. Within Him there is no vanity, bondage, corruption, or decay. He is absolutely free from these things. Vanity, groaning, decay, bondage, and corruption are all by-products of death. Christ, the perfected One, is able to save us from all of these by-products of death and to bring us into His perfection. This is the saving to the uttermost, the saving to perfection. This is the saving of the divine priesthood of Christ.</p>
<p>While Christ was on earth, He solved the problems of sin and death. As we are enjoying His kingly priesthood, we participate in the divine priesthood that diminishes and even swallows up all of the by-products of death. While we enjoy God being ministered into us as the processed One, we partake of the divine priesthood that diminishes, eliminates, and swallows up all of the by-products of death, such as vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay. Day by day there is within us a diminishing, a swallowing up, of our groaning and vanity. The more we participate in the divine priesthood of Christ, the less groaning we have. The more we enjoy the divine priesthood of Christ, the less we will sigh and the more we will shout. According to Romans 8, the last step of God&rsquo;s work on us is to glorify us. To be glorified is to be thoroughly saturated with the divine priesthood. When we have been thoroughly saturated with the divine priesthood, that will be our glorification. To be glorified is also to be delivered from vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay. This is exactly the meaning of glorification in Romans 8&mdash;the full sonship, the redemption of our body (v. 23). The redemption of our body is its being transfigured out of vanity, corruption, and decay into a stage in which it is completely filled with the divine priesthood. That will be our glorification. The Aaronic priesthood is in Romans 3 and 4, the kingly priesthood is in Romans 6 and in the first part of Romans 8, and the divine priesthood is in the middle and the last part of Romans 8. Hebrews 7 does not correspond with Romans 3 or 4; it firstly corresponds with Romans 6 and the first part of Romans 8, and eventually it corresponds completely with the middle and the last parts of Romans 8 dealing with glorification and our deliverance from vanity, corruption, bondage, and decay into the freedom of glory.</p>
<p>We are now on our way toward this perfection. We are in the process of being perfected. As our Forerunner, Christ has already entered into that complete perfection, and we also will be brought there. We will be saved to the uttermost. To be saved to the uttermost is to be brought into Christ&rsquo;s complete perfection where there is no vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, decay, or sighing. To save us in this way is the ministry of the divine priesthood.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s kingly priesthood is for ministry, and His divine priesthood is for saving. He is able to save to the uttermost because He not only is living but also is the indestructible life. Nothing can destroy Him. Although we may have the heart to save others, we can easily be destroyed and terminated. But Christ can save us to the uttermost because His priesthood is composed of an indestructible life. Regardless of our situation or the condition in which we may find ourselves, we have the divine priesthood to take care of us. This divine priesthood is the saving power of the indestructible life. The work of the divine High Priest is mainly to save us to the uttermost. The divine priesthood is constituted with the indestructible life; thus, it is able to save us to the uttermost from all the by-products of death into Christ&rsquo;s perfection.</p>
<p>He saves to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him (Heb. 7:25a). Christ died for all mankind, but not everyone will be saved. This is because not everyone comes forward to God through Him. Although we may have been saved in the sense of being regenerated, we still need more saving (Rom. 5:10). If we do not come forward, we cannot receive His saving. It may be raining, but a vessel cannot receive this rain unless its opening is toward the heavens. Likewise, many genuine Christians today do not receive Christ&rsquo;s saving, because they do not come forward to God. Christ&rsquo;s saving in His priesthood will not reach the ones who will not come forward.</p>
<p>Sometimes we may be saved from our temper only to a certain extent and not to the uttermost. A sister may be about to lose her temper; hence, she turns to Christ and is stopped from losing her temper. She may be saved from her temper but not to the uttermost. If she were saved from her temper to the uttermost, she would be rejoicing in the Lord. For the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we may forgive others&rsquo; mistakes. But to be saved from remembering others&rsquo; mistakes is to be saved to the uttermost. We may forgive others and yet still remember their mistakes. When God forgives us, He forgets (Heb. 8:12); hence, to forgive is to forget. If our forgiving does not equal forgetting, we are not saved to the uttermost. If we have truly forgiven someone, we should also forget the offense. We need to be saved to the uttermost in our forgiving of others and from all our daily troubles. When we come forward to God through Christ, our High Priest, He saves us in the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10) and by the law of the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2).</p><h2 class="head5">2) Always Living to Intercede for Them</h2>
<p>Christ is able to save us because He intercedes for us (Heb. 7:25b). As our High Priest, Christ undertakes our case by interceding for us. He appears before God on our behalf, praying for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. We need to simply rest in His intercession, trust in it, and enjoy it. Be assured that our divine High Priest is continually interceding for us. Many times we have been saved by His intercession. We have a perpetual, constant, and eternal Intercessor.</p>
<p>Our divine High Priest intercedes for us constantly, knowing how easy it is for us to fall and, once we have fallen, to remain in our fallen state. Sooner or later His intercession will overcome, subdue, and save us. We all will be completely subdued and saved by His intercession. God appointed Him to take care of us, and He is now taking care of us by interceding for us. Although we may forget that we have called upon His name, He will never forget it. He is interceding for us, and He will save us to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Since we have such a High Priest interceding for us, we should &ldquo;come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help&rdquo; (4:16). We need to keep coming forward to God. Morning and evening, day and night, we should come forward to Him, saying to Him, &ldquo;I am open to You. You are rich. I need You. I want to stay open to You all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">i.A Minister of the Holy Places in the Heavens<br />
before the Face of God</h2>
<p>Hebrews 8:2 speaks of Christ as &ldquo;a Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.&rdquo; Hebrews 9:24 tells us that &ldquo;Christ did not enter into a holy place made by hands, a figure of the true, but into heaven itself, to appear now before the face of God for us.&rdquo; These verses reveal that Christ as a High Priest is a Minister of the holy places in the heavens before the face of God. We have a Minister in the heavens who has entered into the Holy of Holies in the heavens and appears now before the face of God for us.</p>
<p>In 8:2 <em>Minister</em> refers to one who ministers as a priest. As a minister of the true (heavenly) tabernacle, Christ ministers heaven (which is not only a place but also a condition of life) into us that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth, as He did while He was here. In verse 2 the Greek word for <em>holy places,</em> used as a noun, is plural here. It refers to all the holy places in the tabernacle; strictly, it refers to the Holy of Holies, the holiest of all the holy places (9:8, 12, 25; 10:19; 13:11).</p>
<p>Christ is the Minister of the true tabernacle in the heavens. This tabernacle, this sanctuary, is the third heaven, the heavenly Holy of Holies. We should praise the Lord that the Holy of Holies in the heavens is connected to our spirit. Therefore, in experience, our regenerated spirit is also the Holy of Holies. Our spirit is connected to the third heaven, where Christ is ministering on our behalf. We need to see that Christ as the High Priest desires to give us a heavenly salvation and that He is carrying out the heavenly ministry in the heavenly tabernacle to supply us with the heavenly life (8:2), and that this heavenly life is in the life-giving Spirit. He dispenses Himself as the life-giving Spirit into us from the heavens, causing us to receive the supply of life, enabling us to rejoice when we are ill and to praise Him when we are in trouble.</p>
<p>Christ ministers in the true tabernacle in heaven, which is joined to our spirit. As our High Priest in the heavens, Christ brings us into heaven, from the earthly court into the heavenly Holy of Holies, which is joined to our spirit by Him as the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51). The priests on earth served the shadow (Heb. 8:5), but this Minister in heaven serves the reality. Whatever was done by the priests on earth in the Old Testament was a shadow of the real things to come. What they did on earth served only as a shadow of the reality, but whatever this Minister ministers in heaven in the New Testament is the reality. His more excellent ministry in heaven serves the reality of the heavenly things in the divine dispensing. He is ministering the heavenly life and life supply of the divine riches into all His believers.</p>
<p>Christ is the Minister, ministering to us all the divine, heavenly, spiritual, and eternal things. How can Christ minister the heavenly, spiritual, and eternal things from the heavens to us on the earth? It is by the heavenly &ldquo;television&rdquo; within us. Christ is &ldquo;televising&rdquo; the &ldquo;scenery&rdquo; in the heavens into our spirit. Christ is now far away in the heavens to minister all the heavenly, eternal, and spiritual things to us by the transmission of the eternal Spirit. Whatever is now in the heavens is immediately transmitted into our spirit.</p>
<p>In the true tabernacle, Christ is ministering as the High Priest (vv. 1-2). As the High Priest, He is interceding for us so that everything that He accomplished might be wrought into our being. Just as Melchizedek came to minister the bread and wine to Abraham after he had interceded for him behind the scene, Christ, our Melchizedek, is secretly interceding for all who love Him and seek Him. As He is interceding for us in the heavens, He is also the all-inclusive and all-pervading Spirit. The all-inclusive Spirit works in us according to Christ&rsquo;s heavenly intercession, causing Christ, the firstborn Son of God, to be wrought into our being. Christ is ministering in the true tabernacle today. He ministers the life supply from heaven into the believers that they may receive the enjoyment to function as members of the Body.</p><h2 class="head4">j. Appearing to Those Who Wait for Him a Second Time, apart from Sin, unto Salvation</h2>
<p>Hebrews 9:28 tells us that Christ, &ldquo;having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Apart from Sin</h2>
<p>In verse 28 the word <em>sin,</em> which is singular, refers to our sinful nature. Hebrews 9:26 tells us that Christ &ldquo;has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself.&rdquo; This indicates that He is the sin offering. Moreover, according to 7:27, Christ offered up Himself once for all for our sins. Hebrews 9:28 goes on to say that He has been &ldquo;offered once to bear the sins of many.&rdquo; This indicates that He is also the trespass offering. Because sin has already become history, the second manifestation of Christ has nothing to do with sin. Since Christ has put away sin in His first appearing (1 John 3:5), His second appearing will be apart from sin, having nothing whatever to do with it. In other words, Christ appeared the first time to take away our sin and our sins, and He will appear a second time apart from sin (Heb. 9:24-28).</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Unto Salvation</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s second appearing is not only apart from sin but also unto salvation. When He comes back, He will grant us the highest salvation. The salvation that we have been enjoying today has not yet reached its highest peak. The highest peak of Christ&rsquo;s salvation will be His second appearing. At His coming back, we will enjoy His salvation to the uttermost.</p>
<p>The word <em>salvation</em> in verse 28 has a wide and high meaning, covering many aspects. First, the salvation which Christ will bring to us in His second manifestation is for the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body. When we were saved, we were regenerated in our spirit (John 3:5-6). Now we are in the process of being transformed in our soul (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). Then at Christ&rsquo;s second coming for the completion of the salvation of our entire being, He will transfigure our vile body into a glorious one (Phil. 3:21). That will be the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23), the first aspect of Christ&rsquo;s appearing &ldquo;unto salvation&rdquo; in His second manifestation.</p>
<p>The second aspect of the salvation by Christ&rsquo;s second coming is the deliverance from the vanity and slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (vv. 18-23; Phil. 3:20-21). The entire old creation has been subjected to vanity and is under the slavery of corruption. Even we who have been saved and who have the enjoyment of the Spirit are also under the vanity and the slavery of corruption of the old creation. At His second coming, Christ will free us from this vanity and slavery and deliver us into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</p>
<p>At His second coming, Christ will glorify us (v. 17); that is, He will bring us into His glory to fulfill the word in Hebrews 2:10. Our glorification is the final goal of God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ (Rom. 8:29-30). We have been chosen, predestinated, called, and justified. Now we are being sanctified through the process of transformation in life. Then in His second manifestation, we will be glorified and reach the final goal of God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ. This is the third aspect of Christ&rsquo;s coming salvation.</p>
<p>In regeneration we were born of God and became the sons of God (John 1:12-13). In this new birth we received the divine sonship in our spirit (Rom. 8:15). After this, we began to enjoy this sonship through the transformation of our soul. The more we are transformed in our soul, the more we enjoy the sonship which has been given to us in our spirit. This sonship will become full when our body of the old creation is transfigured into a body of the new creation. This means that the redemption of our body is the full sonship of our new birth. This will be the fourth aspect of Christ&rsquo;s salvation in His second manifestation.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ is to work Himself into us as our enjoyment. He has given to us His Spirit in our spirit as the firstfruits for our enjoyment (v. 23). The firstfruits of the Spirit are the foretaste for our enjoyment of God. The full taste will be brought in for our enjoyment by Christ&rsquo;s second manifestation. When our body is transfigured and our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;is fully saturated with the element of the Triune God, we will enjoy God in full. That will be our full taste of God, the last aspect of Christ&rsquo;s coming salvation.</p>
<p>The salvation that Christ will bring to us in His second coming will be such a wider and higher one and will fulfill the final and ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s all-inclusive salvation in Christ. Before His second manifestation, Christ is ministering to us with this goal in view. His more excellent ministry in the heavens today, the ministry of His kingly and divine priesthood with His heavenly intercession, is building up such a salvation. When He sees that the building up of this wonderful salvation has been accomplished, He will appear the second time. That will be His second manifestation in God&rsquo;s economy.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(82)</h1>
<p>In the previous messages we have seen that according to the book of Hebrews, Christ is the One superior to the angels both as the Son of God and the Son of Man (chs. 1&mdash;2); He is the One superior to Moses as an Apostle worthy of more glory and honor (ch. 3); and He is the One superior to Aaron as a High Priest according to the order of Mechizedek (chs. 4&mdash;7). In this message we will see that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the Forerunner.</p>
<h2 class="head3">98. The Forerunner</h2>
<p>Hebrews 6:19-20 reveals that Christ is our Forerunner. The Lord Jesus as the Forerunner has entered &ldquo;within the veil&rdquo; for us, &ldquo;having become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Jesus Having Entered within the Veil for Us</h2>
<p>Verses 19 and 20 do not say that Jesus has entered the heavens; rather, they say that He has entered within the veil, that is, within the Holy of Holies. This indicates that today, the place where Jesus is, is the Holy of Holies. According to the Old Testament type of the tabernacle, God dwelt in the Holy of Holies. The Lord Jesus entered the heavens, which are today the Holy of Holies within the veil, to be a High Priest for us according to the order of Melchizedek. In the ministry of His priesthood, Christ is ministering to us all the divine riches in the heavenly atmosphere.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 6 all the believers are encouraged to go on to reach maturity (v. 1), that is, to go on to the heavenly ministry of Christ in the Holy of Holies in the heavens. To go on to this ministry, we must learn how to follow the Pioneer, the Christ who has become the Forerunner within the veil. In order to go on to this heavenly ministry, we have to enter the veil.</p>
<p>As the Forerunner, the Lord Jesus took the lead to pass through the stormy sea and enter the heavenly haven to be the High Priest for us according to the order of Melchizedek. As such a Forerunner, He is the Author of our salvation (2:10). As the Forerunner, He cut the way to glory, and as the Author, He entered into glory.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Forerunner, the Pioneer, who has cut the way into glory within the veil. To be within the veil is to be in glory. As our Forerunner, our Pioneer, Christ cut the way into glory and is now in glory. We are all running in God&rsquo;s race, and the man Jesus Christ is our Forerunner in this race. He has run the race, becoming the first to reach the goal. He was the first to enter within the veil, where He is now waiting for us. We need to experience Christ as the Forerunner and follow Him to run the race.</p>
<p>The Lord as the Pioneer and Forerunner is the example, the model, of a person who has entered into God&rsquo;s glory. He suffered and entered into glory (Luke 24:26; 1 Pet. 1:11). The glory into which Christ entered is the full expression of God. When the Lord was in the flesh, God was concealed within Him. Within Him was the seed of the divine glory. In Jesus, the Nazarene with blood and flesh, was the seed of God&rsquo;s divine glory, but this glory was concealed within Him just as the glory of a carnation is concealed within the carnation seed. When the carnation seed falls into the earth, dies, and grows until it reaches the stage of blossoming, the carnation seed is brought into glory. Jesus was such a seed. He fell into the earth, died, and grew up (John 12:23-24). By His growing up, His whole being, including His humanity and His human nature, was brought into the glorious expression of God. That was His glory. The Lord suffered death and entered into the glory, into the full expression of the Divine Being. After His resurrection, He was God&rsquo;s glorious expression. That was the glory into which He entered. He is the example, the model, because He was the first One who pioneered into glory, the One who paved the way.</p>
<p>This Pioneer, this Forerunner, entered within the veil. The veil is that which separates us from God&rsquo;s expression. By passing through death, Jesus entered within the veil. There within the veil is nothing but the expression of God. He is there now in glory. There is a man in the glory. This means that there is a man in God&rsquo;s expression. Even more, there is a man who is God&rsquo;s expression, a man who is God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>This wonderful man Jesus, who is the model, example, Forerunner, Pioneer, and Captain, one day entered into us. We might have been unconscious of it, but He entered into us. Who is this Jesus who has come into us? He is not only the Savior&mdash;He is the One who took the lead to run the race into glory, the One who has entered into the full expression of God, the One who, even today, is this full expression of God. This Jesus, who is God&rsquo;s expression, the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory (Heb. 1:3), is the Jesus who has come into us. Therefore, Colossians 1:27 says, &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This glory is still a hope to us because it has not yet come out of us. Once we sow a carnation seed into the earth, we have the hope of its blossoming. Although we cannot see it blossoming yet, we believe that it will blossom. Christ within us is the hope of glory. Since the seed of glory has been sown into us, we all hope to see it blossoming.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this wonderful One is within the veil, dwelling there in the expression of God and as the expression of God. On the other hand, He has come into us and is now within us. He does not have to leave the glory in order to come into us. While He is within the veil and within us, He is ministering from there to here. He entered within the veil as the Pioneer, the Forerunner, entering into the glory which is the full, glorious expression of the Divine Being. Now He is in glory as the Captain of our salvation. One day this Captain of salvation came into us, but in His coming into us He never left the glory. Rather, He brought the glory into us. He came into us, and the glory came with Him. In other words, the Captain of salvation came into us to be the seed of glory. Now we all have this seed of glory within us. He took the lead to pioneer the way into glory. Since He was the first to enter into glory, He, as our Forerunner, is fully qualified to be the Captain of our salvation.</p>
<p>Hebrews 6:18 speaks of having &ldquo;fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;have fled for refuge&rdquo; means to flee intensively; it refers to an intensified fleeing. In order to enter into the Holy of Holies within the veil, the Lord Jesus fled everything. He fled His mother, His brothers, and Judaism and entered within the veil (Matt. 12:46-50). He fled everything to enter into the presence of God within the veil, where we anchor our hope with full assurance (Heb. 6:19, 11).</p>
<p>Today, like our Forerunner, we need to flee into the Holy of Holies within the veil, that is, into our spirit. Instead of staying in our staggering soul and our wandering mind, we need to flee into our spirit. We must flee whatever situation we are in. Every situation is a stormy sea, for it can hold us back, keeping us from entering into today&rsquo;s rest. Consider the type of the children of Israel who came out of Egypt. Although approximately two million came out of Egypt, only two of them entered into the rest. All the others were distracted. We face the same possibility today. There is not one thing which cannot hold us back. We must flee everything into the Holy of Holies where our Forerunner, Jesus Christ, has entered within the veil. This is what it means to run the race.</p>
<p>We should flee from our disposition, our views, and our thoughts into the Holy of Holies. If we do not flee, we will be under the hand of the devil. Our Forerunner has already entered into the Holy of Holies. Today we all need to flee to the Holy of Holies, to the presence of God. We must flee until we have nothing else to flee from, until we are directly touching God and are face to face with Him. In this way we will be with God in the Holy of Holies, and there will be no need for us to flee anymore.</p>
<p>After showing that the heavenly Christ is within the veil, the book of Hebrews encourages us to enter within the veil (10:19-20, 22). Within the veil, we can look away unto Him (12:2) and consider Him (3:1; 12:3). We need to have direct contact with Him. Since He is within the veil, we also must enter within the veil so that we may see Him, look at Him, and consider Him in order to receive His transfusion and infusion. To enter within the veil means to enter into the Holy of Holies, where the Lord is enthroned in glory. Hence, we must be in our spirit, where, experientially speaking, the practical Holy of Holies is today. To enter within the veil is to enter into our spirit. When we turn to our spirit and exercise it, we enter within the veil (1 Tim. 4:7-8). We must exercise our spirit in order that we may enter within the veil to have direct contact with the heavenly Christ, the man in the glory, beholding Him to be transfused and infused with Him so that we may become His corporate reproduction. Moreover, to be within the veil is to be in the Holy of Holies, a realm where we partake of Christ and enjoy Him as the hidden manna, the budding rod, and the law of life, issuing in God&rsquo;s corporate expression for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose (Heb. 9:3-4).</p><h2 class="head4">b. His Becoming Forever a High Priest<br />
according to the Order of Melchizedek</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 6:20 we are told that as the Forerunner, Christ has entered within the veil, &ldquo;having become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible reveals two orders of the priesthood: the order according to Aaron and the order according to Melchizedek. The order of priests according to Aaron was a matter of man bringing his needs to God, because these priests were chosen from among men. By contrast, the order according to Melchizedek was a matter of coming from God to man, imparting God to man. The order of Melchizedek is revealed in Genesis 14:18-20, where we see that Melchizedek came from God with bread and wine to meet and bless Abraham who had fought in battle for God.</p>
<p>There are two directions, a &ldquo;two-way traffic,&rdquo; in these two orders of the priesthood. In the first order the direction is from man to God, and in the second it is from God to man. Christ as our great High Priest has these two orders with two directions. He is the High Priest according to the order of Aaron and also the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek. On the one hand, according to the order of Aaron, Christ as the Son of Man was chosen from among men to go to God with all the needs of man. On the other hand, according to the order of Melchizedek, Christ as the Son of God came from God to impart God into us and bless us with God.</p>
<p>As the Forerunner, the Lord Jesus is now within the veil, in the Holy of Holies in heaven. His purifying of sins is typified by the work of Aaron, whereas His sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high (Heb. 1:3) is according to the order of Melchizedek (Psa. 110:1, 4). His work on the cross on earth, typified by the work of Aaron, affords us forgiveness of sins. His ministry on the throne in heaven ministers to us the overcoming of sin. His cross delivered us out of Egypt; His throne brings us into Canaan. We participated in His work on the cross. Now we need to press on to enter into the enjoyment of His ministry on the throne. We need to enter into the full participation in His priesthood according to the order of Melchizedek. If we do this, we will have a complete overcoming of sin, and sin will be absolutely under our feet. We will be in the Holy of Holies, having nothing to do with sin but continually enjoying grace.</p>
<p>As our High Priest, the heavenly Christ is not according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchizedek. We need to be occupied with the present Melchizedek. Melchizedek is not a High Priest for the purpose of offering sacrifices to God for our sins but for ministering the processed God as grace into us. Now sin is over, and grace is here. Sin has gone, and the enjoyment of God has come. It is no longer a matter of offering sacrifices for sin but rather a matter of ministering bread and wine for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>The book of Hebrews reveals that although Christ completed His redemptive work, He is very active as our High Priest, ministering Himself into us as the processed bread and wine for our daily supply. This is why today the heavenly Christ is a High Priest not according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchizedek. Today Christ on the throne is not the sacrifice-offering High Priest; He is the bread-and-wine-ministering High Priest. First, we need Christ&rsquo;s priesthood as typified by Aaron to offer the sacrifices for sin. Then we need His priesthood according to the order of Melchizedek to minister the life supply to us.</p>
<p>Having the processed God ministered into us as our supply fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. However, offering the sacrifices for sin is merely to deal with the negative situation. God&rsquo;s original purpose was not to redeem us; it was to impart and work Himself into us. Since we became fallen, He had to rescue us, redeem us, and reconcile us to God. Whereas this is the function of His priesthood, as typified by Aaron, His priesthood according to the order of Melchizedek is for God&rsquo;s original purpose. If we had not fallen, we would not have needed the priesthood typified by Aaron, but we would still need Christ&rsquo;s priesthood according to the order of Melchizedek to minister God into us. Most Christians know only Christ&rsquo;s priesthood as typified by the priesthood of Aaron for reconciliation. But according to Hebrews, Christ as our High Priest is not mainly the One who offers the sacrifice for sin, but the One who ministers into us the processed God as the bread and wine.</p>
<p>It is significant that when Melchizedek met Abraham, he ministered to Abraham, the one who fought for God&rsquo;s interests, the bread and wine as the life supply from God. Likewise, Christ as a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek is supplying the divine elements as bread and wine to us who are today&rsquo;s fighters for God&rsquo;s interests on earth.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 4:14 we are told that we have &ldquo;a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God,&rdquo; and in verse 16 we are told to &ldquo;come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.&rdquo; When we come to chapter 5, we see that the High Priest whom we meet at the throne of grace is not a priest typified by the order of Aaron but a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, ministering to us the bread and wine as our supply. Today we can come to the throne of grace and enjoy such a positive High Priest ministering the bread and wine. Instead of trying to be a success by our own effort, we simply need to come forward to the throne of grace and touch our High Priest who ministers to us bread and wine. This is the best meal. As much as we need a physical breakfast every day, we also should enjoy Christ as our breakfast every morning. The best dining table is the throne of grace where we enjoy Christ in such a positive way. Christ is our Melchizedek today. How we need to come forward to the throne of grace to Him, the One who ministers the bread and wine!</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(83)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">99. The Surety and the Mediator<br />
of a Better Covenant, the New Covenant</h2>
<p>In the book of Hebrews Christ is presented as the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant, the new covenant. According to 7:22, Jesus has &ldquo;become the surety of a better covenant.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;surety&rdquo; means &ldquo;a guarantee, bondsman, sponsor,&rdquo; and is from the root word meaning &ldquo;a hand into which something is placed as a pledge,&rdquo; implying that the guarantee, the surety, cannot be unbound. Christ is not only the consummator of the new covenant; He is also the surety, the pledge that everything in that covenant will be fulfilled. He is the surety, guaranteeing the effectiveness of this covenant. That Christ has become the surety of a better covenant is based on the fact that He is the living and perpetual High Priest.</p>
<p>Christ pledged Himself to the new covenant and to us. There is no possibility for Christ to change His mind. The effectiveness of the new covenant is guaranteed because He pledged Himself to us. This pledge depends completely on His divine priesthood.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s pledge is unlimited because the Christ who pledged Himself to us is unlimited. He can do everything and will do everything for us. He is the qualified, capable, and able surety. Christ is also the surety, the Guarantor, of the new covenant. He is not only the Guarantor; He is also the guarantee, insuring the new covenant. He is always available and prevailing, fulfilling whatever He has guaranteed.</p>
<p>The new covenant, the covenant enacted on the law of life, can never fail because Christ Himself is the surety of this covenant. Everything included in it will be fulfilled. It is not fulfilled by us but by our surety. Christ is not only the consummator of the new covenant; He is also the surety, the pledge that everything in it will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>According to Hebrews 8:6, Christ is also &ldquo;the Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.&rdquo; In His heavenly ministry Christ, as the Mediator, is the Executor of the new covenant, the new testament, which He bequeathed to us by His death. This better covenant mentioned in verse 6 not only was enacted upon better promises of a better law, the inner law of life (vv. 10-12), but also was consummated with Christ&rsquo;s better sacrifices (9:23), which accomplished for us an eternal redemption (v. 12), and the better blood of Christ, which purifies our conscience (v. 14). Even more, the High Priest of this better covenant, the eternal Son of the living God, ministers with a more excellent ministry (8:6) and in the greater and more perfect tabernacle (9:11).</p>
<p>The establishment of the new covenant is based not only on the blood of the Lord Jesus; the Lord Jesus Himself is the Mediator of this covenant. To be a mediator means that one bears the responsibility of both parties; as the Mediator, Christ bears responsibility on God&rsquo;s side and on man&rsquo;s side. In other words, as the Mediator, He is the One who executes the covenant to make it a reality. The Lord Jesus established this new covenant in His own blood, and He also executes this covenant through His incorruptible life.</p>
<p>The items of the covenant are things that Christ has already accomplished, and there are no conditions or terms for their completion. By shedding His blood, Christ enacted this deed, the covenant, and through His death He left this title deed to us as a will, a testament. Hebrews 9:16-17 says, &ldquo;For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established. For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living.&rdquo; A covenant is an agreement made by the giver, which is in effect while he is alive, while a testament is a will. When the maker of the covenant dies, the covenant comes into effect as a will. By His death and the shedding of His blood, Christ signed the title deed and left it to us as a will. Because the Maker of the will died, we have the legal and judicial right to claim what is in the will.</p>
<p>With a will there is the need of an executor or arbiter. A will comes into effect when the one who makes it dies, but because some of the parties named in the will may not be proper, there is the need of an executor to execute the will faithfully. After resurrecting and ascending to the heavens, Christ became the Executor of the will in the heavenly court. Christ is not only the Maker of the covenant and the Giver of the will; He is also the Executor of the will. By shedding His blood He enacted the covenant, by dying He gave the will, and in resurrection and ascension He is today the Executor of this will in the heavenly law court.</p>
<p>In verse 15 we have the word <em>covenant,</em> and in verse 16, the word <em>testament.</em> In Greek the same word is used for both <em>covenant</em> and <em>testament.</em> A covenant is an agreement containing some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, while a testament is a will containing certain accomplished things that are bequeathed to the inheritor. The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant but a testament in which all the things that were accomplished by the death of Christ have been bequeathed to us. First, God gave the promise that He would make a new covenant (Jer. 31:31-34). Then Christ shed His blood to enact the covenant (Luke 22:20). Since accomplished facts are promised in this covenant, it is also a testament. This testament, this will, was confirmed and validated by Christ&rsquo;s death and is being executed by Christ in His ascension.</p>
<p>The New Testament, therefore, is a new will for our inheritance. This new will is for the bequeathing of the divine blessings, including the person of Christ and His all-inclusive redemptive work. The One who enacted this new will is Jesus Christ, who died for its enactment. Now, whatever He enacted has been bequeathed to us and is available to us.</p>
<p>All the promises of God have become accomplished facts in the new covenant through Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work, and all these accomplished facts have become bequests in the new testament. As the Mediator of the new covenant, Christ in resurrection is now enforcing the new covenant, and as the Executor, He is executing the new testament so that all the bequests of the accomplished facts may become effective for our full enjoyment of them.</p>
<p>Christ enacted the new covenant (which became the new testament&mdash;the will) with His blood, according to God&rsquo;s righteousness through His redeeming death (Matt. 26:28; Luke 22:20; Heb. 9:15). In resurrection Christ became the reality of all the bequests of the new testament and the Mediator, the Executor, to execute the new testament according to God&rsquo;s righteousness (8:6; 9:15; 12:24). Therefore, Christ is the new covenant as the new testament (cf. Isa. 42:6; 49:8).</p>
<p>Christ, as the embodiment of the riches of the Godhead (Col. 2:9; 1:19) and as the crucified and resurrected One, has become the covenant of God given to His people. He is the reality of all that God is and all that God has given us. God&rsquo;s salvation, God&rsquo;s righteousness, God&rsquo;s justification, God&rsquo;s forgiveness, God&rsquo;s redemption, God&rsquo;s riches, and all that God has and will do have been covenanted to us. As the reality of all the bequests in the new testament, Christ, who is the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, consummated Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:9-11), is in our spirit and has become one spirit with us (2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17). As a covenant, Christ is the surety (Heb. 7:22), and the Spirit is the pledge (2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:14), to guarantee that God embodied in Christ is the inheritance to His people (Rom. 8:17a; Acts 26:18).</p>
<p>The new testament is the covenant given to us by God. If there were no Christ, all the bequests in the new testament&mdash;the will&mdash;would be nothing. When God gave us the Bible as a will, this meant that God gave us Christ. Christ is the centrality and universality as the reality of the new testament. When Christ is given, that means He is the covenant. We have not only the items of the new testament in our mind but also the reality of this covenant, who is Christ, in our spirit. Christ in our spirit is the reality of the new testament. Hence, He is the covenant.</p>
<p>The new testament as a will has many promises. All these promises are the bequests of that will. Christ is everything for that will, and He is every item of that will. Eventually, He is the will. Without Christ, the Bible is empty. Christ is the reality of the Bible. Without Christ, the new covenant, the new testament, is empty. Christ is the reality of the new testament; therefore, Christ is the new testament. It is impossible to separate Christ from the new testament. Now we can understand the logic by which God considers Christ to be a covenant given to us. Hence, Christ has become the new covenant as the new testament according to God&rsquo;s righteousness to be the base of God&rsquo;s full salvation, through His death and in His resurrection. The way to receive and enjoy Christ as the covenant given to us is to exercise our spirit, to live according to our spirit, and to remain in our spirit, with which is Christ (2 Tim. 4:22).</p>
<p>Christ is the Mediator of this covenant, the Performer of this covenant, and the Testator of this covenant, the One who gives this covenant as a testament to us. He is the Executor of this testament, this will, and He is also the sacrifice which made it possible. He is such a One with such a covenant, and now we all have been made partakers of Him. The Holy Spirit today is the reality of this wonderful One. To be made partakers of Christ means that we have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, the reality of Christ. Now, day by day we partake of this Spirit, the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29).</p><h2 class="head4">a. A Priest Forever with the Taking of an Oath</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 7:21, we see that Christ as the Mediator of the new covenant became the living and perpetual High Priest with the taking of an oath. As the only begotten Son and the firstborn Son of God, Christ became the High Priest with the taking of an oath by God (vv. 20-21, 28). Not one of the Levitical priests was ever established by God&rsquo;s oath. Yet according to Psalm 110:4, God swore to make Christ a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek. In Hebrews 7 the writer quotes that oath from Psalm 110. This is very weighty, proving that Christ&rsquo;s becoming the divine High Priest was consummated and established by God&rsquo;s oath.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Having Obtained a More Excellent Ministry</h2>
<p>Hebrews 8:6 says that Christ &ldquo;has obtained a more excellent ministry inasmuch as He is also the Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.&rdquo; The Old Testament priests had a ministry, and the children of Israel respected their ministry. But the ministry that Christ has obtained in His ascension&mdash;His ministry on the throne&mdash;is more excellent than that of the Old Testament priests in the tabernacle. This is His heavenly ministry in the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>As the Minister of the true (heavenly) tabernacle, Christ obtained in His ascension a more excellent ministry to minister heaven, which is not only a place but a condition of life, into us that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth, as He did while He was here, to fulfill our heavenly calling (3:1).</p>
<p>Hebrews 8:2 says that Christ is a &ldquo;Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.&rdquo; Christ ministers in the true tabernacle in heaven, which is joined to our spirit. As our High Priest in the heavens, Christ brings us into heaven, from the earthly court into the heavenly Holy of Holies, which is joined to our spirit by Him as the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51). The priests on earth served the shadow (Heb. 8:5), but this Minister in heaven serves the reality. Whatever was done by the priests on earth in the Old Testament was a shadow of the real things to come. What they did on earth served only as a shadow of the reality, but whatever this Minister ministers in heaven in the New Testament is the reality. His more excellent ministry in heaven serves the reality of the heavenly things in the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>In the old covenant the high priest was a mortal man, and his ministry was a shadow of the good things to come. But the new testament has a High Priest who is the eternal Son of God with a more excellent ministry (vv. 1-13). His ministry is the ministry of the kingly and divine priesthood in heaven, ministering, by His intercession, the divine life with all its riches as our daily supply to bring us into His perfection and glorification.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s more excellent ministry is to intercede for us. Christ&rsquo;s intercession is like a powerful motor which energizes a machine to operate. Just as the motor runs to transmit power into the machine, the interceding Christ in the heavens is transmitting the heavenly power into us.</p>
<p>Only two verses in the Bible, Hebrews 7:25 and Romans 8:34, tell us that Christ is interceding for us, and these two verses correspond to each other. According to Romans 8, Christ is interceding not merely for poor sinners to be justified but for the believers to be glorified. This corresponds to the interceding in Hebrews 7:25, where we are told that Christ intercedes for us that we may be saved to the uttermost. Being saved to the uttermost is the equivalent of glorification. As we pointed out in one of the previous messages, to be glorified is to have our being completely saturated with Christ&rsquo;s divine priesthood. When our whole being has been saturated and permeated with His divine priesthood, that will be our glorification, the last step of God&rsquo;s salvation. At that time we will enjoy full sonship, which will be consummated by the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). Glorification does not save us from sins or even from death; it saves us from the by-products of death, from groaning, vanity, corruption, bondage, and decay. These by-products of death require that we be saved to the uttermost, and Christ is able to do this. Without Hebrews 7 we would never realize that the interceding Christ is the kingly, divine High Priest. Without Hebrews 7 we might think, according to Romans 8, that the interceding Christ is only the Savior. But the interceding Christ is more than the Savior&mdash;He is the kingly and divine High Priest, the heavenly Minister. The heavenly Minister is our interceding Christ.</p>
<p>In Romans 8 we see Christ&rsquo;s intercession in heaven as well as the groaning throughout the whole universe. The whole creation is groaning for liberation, groaning to be released from the by-products of death. Today we have the intercession of our Christ in the heavens and the groaning throughout the whole universe. God must find a people on earth to be His &ldquo;operating machine&rdquo; to bring in that glorious freedom. We should be people through whom God is operating to bring in glorification.</p>
<p>This glorious freedom must first be brought into our being. This is accomplished through our heavenly Intercessor. Christ&rsquo;s intercession in the third heaven energizes us on the earth. Whenever we pray, we sense the empowering, the energizing, from the Lord&rsquo;s intercession. Our Christian work should be accomplished by the energy transmitted into us by the heavenly dynamo. When we pray for the Lord&rsquo;s interests on the earth, we have the deep sense that the Lord&rsquo;s intercession is empowering us from within. Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry is not a ministry that takes care of pitiful sinners; it is the more excellent ministry operating God&rsquo;s economy. As a heavenly Minister with a more excellent ministry, Christ is interceding for us and ministering to us.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<p>In this message we will continue to consider our experience and enjoyment of Christ as the surety and Mediator of a better covenant, the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Of a Better Covenant, the New Covenant,<br />
Enacted upon Better Promises</h2>
<p>Hebrews 8:6 tells us that a more excellent ministry that Christ has obtained in His ascension is of a better covenant, the new covenant, enacted upon better promises. The Old Testament, as the old covenant, was made with the outward law of the dead letters, whereas the New Testament, as the new covenant, was enacted upon better promises related to the things of eternal life.</p>
<p>Christ is the Mediator of a better covenant. The new covenant, which the Lord Jesus enacted, is better than the old covenant made through Moses. The new covenant is better than the old covenant, just as the reality of a person is better than his photograph. The old covenant, like a photograph, had only the outward form, but the new covenant, like the real person, has the inward life with all its reality. The old covenant was lifeless, but the new covenant is constituted with the indestructible life (7:16). In the old covenant all things were shadows, whereas in the new covenant everything is reality. Everything in the old covenant has been fulfilled and realized in the new covenant. Hence, it is a better covenant.</p>
<p>A covenant is an agreement containing some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, whereas a testament is a will containing certain accomplished things bequeathed to the inheritor. The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant but a testament with all the things which have been accomplished by the death of Christ bequeathed to us. The term <em>testament</em> is the equivalent of the modern term <em>will.</em> A will becomes effective only after the death of the maker of the will. The Bible is composed of two wills&mdash;the Old Testament, which is the old will, and the New Testament, which is the new will. The Bible is not mainly a book of teachings; it is a will.</p>
<p>The new covenant has replaced the old covenant (8:7, 13). When a real person comes, he replaces his photograph, for the reality replaces the picture, the shadow. The old covenant had fault and became old, decrepit, and near to disappearing, and the new covenant was consummated to replace it. Now it is meaningless for anyone to still remain in the old covenant.</p>
<p>The new covenant, a better covenant, was enacted upon better promises (v. 6). The better promises, which are given in Jeremiah 31:31-34 and quoted in Hebrews 8:8-13 and 10:16-17, cover four major things: (1) propitiation for our unrighteousnesses and the forgetting (forgiveness) of our sins (8:12); (2) the imparting of the law of life by the imparting of the divine life into us (v. 10a); (3) the privilege of having God as our God and of being His people&mdash;the divine life&rsquo;s enabling us to participate in the enjoyment of God in fellowship with Him (v. 10b); and (4) the function of life that enables us to know Him in the inward way of life (v. 11).</p>
<p>Under the old covenant there was no forgiveness of sins, only the covering of sins. In the new covenant we do not have merely the covering of sins but the forgiveness of sins. The forgiveness of sins, being the putting away of sins, is better than the covering of sins, which never removed the sins. In the new covenant there is the law of life, the blessing of having God and of being His people, and the inward ability of knowing God. These three things are of the divine life imparted into us in God&rsquo;s regeneration. Because of the imparting of life and the forgiveness of sins, these are the better promises.</p>
<p>Among these four major blessings of the new covenant, the inward law of life is the focus. The old covenant was made with the outward law of letters, whereas the new covenant is enacted with this inward law of life. The old covenant was of letters; the new covenant is of life.</p>
<p>Every life has a law. The higher the life, the higher is its law. The divine life that we receive of God is the highest life; therefore, it has the highest law. By imparting His divine life into us, God puts this highest law into our spirit, whence it spreads into our inward parts, such as our mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>The law of life differs from the law of letters. The law of life regulates us from within by and according to its life element, whereas the law of letters regulates us from without by and according to its dead letters. The law of dead letters depends on outward teachings, but the law of life depends on the inward consciousness. Since we all, great or small, have the law of life, we do not need outward teachings that are according to the law of letters.</p>
<p>It is according to the law of life that we are a people to God and that He is God to us. God&rsquo;s relationship with us today is based fully on the law of life so that today we do not need to walk according to the knowledge of the law of letters but should walk according to the consciousness of the law of life.</p><h2 class="head4">d. His Blood Purifying Our Conscience<br />
from Dead Works to Serve the Living God</h2>
<p>Hebrews 9:14 says, &ldquo;How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?&rdquo; The blood by which the new covenant was enacted purifies our conscience from dead works to serve the living God. This indicates that in a sense the Old Testament priests served God in dead works. But today, instead of serving God in dead works, we may serve the living God in a living way. This is because our conscience has been purified by the blood of Christ from the dead works of the old creation.</p>
<p>The blood of Christ purifies our conscience to serve the living God. To serve the living God requires a blood-purified conscience. To worship in dead religion or to serve any dead thing other than God does not require that our conscience be purified. The conscience is the leading part of our spirit. The living God whom we desire to serve always comes to our spirit (John 4:24) by touching our conscience. He is righteous, holy, and living. Our defiled conscience needs to be purified so that we may serve Him in a living way. To worship God religiously in our mind does not require this.</p>
<p>Hebrews 9:14 speaks of &ldquo;dead works&rdquo; and &ldquo;the living God.&rdquo; Since we were dead (Eph. 2:1; Col. 2:13), whatever we did, bad or good, was dead works before the living God. Hebrews is a book which reveals the living God (3:12; 9:14; 10:31; 12:22). To touch this living God we need to exercise our spirit (4:12) and have a blood-purified conscience.</p>
<p>Whenever we have a feeling that we are sinful or wrong, our conscience is dirty and needs the blood to purify it. Christ shed His blood on the cross to meet all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. Then this blood was brought into heaven itself to be sprinkled before the face of God for our forgiveness and redemption. Our conscience within us corresponds to God in heaven. When God in heaven condemns, the conscience within us also condemns, and when God in heaven releases, our conscience also releases. Therefore, when the blood of Christ was sprinkled in the presence of God, our conscience was also sprinkled and released. For this reason we have a good conscience, and we have peace in our conscience.</p>
<p>Since the Lord&rsquo;s blood cleanses us from our sins before God and His law, it purifies our conscience, thus enabling us to serve our living God with boldness. The blood of Christ is powerful enough to purge, or cleanse, our conscience from every guilty stain.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, 1 John 1:9 says, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&rdquo; Whenever we sin and sense guilt within, we may simply open to God and pray in this way: &ldquo;Forgive me for what I did. Thank You that on the cross Christ died for me and paid for this sin that I have committed. I believe that this sin has been forgiven by You. Now I claim His precious blood to cleanse my conscience from any stain of guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ died nearly two thousand years ago. His blood was already shed and is always available to purify our conscience. His blood is all-powerful. Whenever we sense guilt in our conscience, we should immediately claim His precious blood. Through the precious blood of Christ, the problem of guilt is solved, and we have rest in our conscience.</p>
<p>We must have a purged and pure conscience, a conscience without offense, accusation, or condemnation, so that we may have the peace and assurance to serve God. Paul also tells us that in order to come near to God to contact Him, we must have a heart sprinkled from an evil, wicked, or defiled conscience (Heb. 10:22). If we have a pure conscience without offense or accusation, we will be at peace, and we will have the assurance of faith, the boldness, to contact God and serve Him.</p>
<p>If we do not know how to apply the blood of Christ, we will not know how to exercise our spirit. Whenever we come to exercise our spirit to contact God, we should apply the blood to cleanse our conscience. God is righteous, holy, and in glory, but we are sinful, evil, dirty, worldly, common, and short of His glory (Rom. 3:23). Therefore, we need the blood to bridge the gap between us and God so that we may come into His presence by exercising our spirit to contact Him. We must learn how to apply the blood. When we apply the blood, it gives us the victory over the accusations of the evil one, and we immediately have the peace within and the boldness to contact and serve God (Rev. 12:11).</p>
<p>We should make a thorough confession of our sins so that our conscience would be purified by the blood of Christ. Once our conscience is purged by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, we can be poor in spirit. We will no longer feel that we know so much. We will be humble and hungry for the real experience of the Lord. If we are proud, our spirit will not be open to the Lord, and He will have no way to abide in us. But the purging of our conscience will issue in an open spirit.</p>
<p>If our conscience is not purified by the Lord&rsquo;s blood and our spirit is not open to the Lord, if we are not poor in our spirit and pure in our heart, our mind will be loose and dull. For instance, when we come to the meetings and listen to the messages, we will have no discernment. But once our conscience is purged by the blood of Christ, our mind will be keen and our discernment clear. This is what the Scripture calls a sound, or sober, mind (2 Tim. 1:7). Whenever we hear a message, our mind will be sharp to grasp and confirm what is shared in the message.</p>
<p>A blood-purified conscience will also affect our emotion. Before we make a thorough confession of our sins, failures, and weaknesses, our emotion may be lukewarm. But once we have confessed, our lukewarm emotion will be set on fire with love for the Lord. We will declare, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You! I am on fire for You!&rdquo; Our will also will be changed from being stubborn to being submissive. We will enjoy obeying the Lord (cf. Phil. 2:12), and we will be willing to obey Him in all things great or small.</p>
<p>With such a blood-purified conscience, open spirit, sober mind, loving emotion, and submissive will, there will be a flow of the Lord within our whole being. We will be abiding in Him and He in us. In this way the Lord will dispense Himself into us continually. There is no way for lifeless people to serve the living God. Through the redeeming blood of Christ, we have life and have been brought into the presence of God to serve Him. The blood of Christ makes it possible for us to serve the living God.</p><h2 class="head4">e. His Death Having Taken Place for Redemption<br />
That the Called Ones Might Receive<br />
the Promise of the Eternal Inheritance</h2>
<p>Hebrews 9:15-16 says of Christ, &ldquo;He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ&rsquo;s death took place for redemption in order that we, the called ones, might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. This is according to the New Testament, which is based upon the new covenant in which God promised to us the eternal inheritance, that is, God Himself for our eternal enjoyment.</p>
<p>The eternal inheritance is God Himself with all that He is, has, has done, and will do. All this is our eternal inheritance for our enjoyment. The way through which we inherit this is the new covenant. The promise of the eternal inheritance is based on Christ&rsquo;s eternal redemption, not on our work. Through His redemptive work, Christ has secured for us this promised eternal inheritance. Now with His resurrection life He is bringing us, the called and redeemed ones, into participation in all the riches of this eternal inheritance, according to the new testament in the new covenant way, that is, in the way of the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>We have seen that after the Lord left the covenant with us, it became the new testament containing all the accomplished facts as our bequests. The Lord&rsquo;s new testament is executed by the resurrected Christ as the Mediator in the heavens (12:24). While the Lord is resting on His throne in the heavens, He is concerned for all the heirs of this new testament. He is concerned about whether the heirs are wise and diligent enough to take the bequests, or whether they are trusting in their own cleverness and trying to do something else. Because He is so concerned, He is interceding that we will have the full realization of all the bequests contained in His bequeathed will. If our eyes are opened to see this matter of the Lord&rsquo;s testament, we will be beside ourselves with joy. Most Christians understand God&rsquo;s salvation in a low way according to the natural human concept, not in the way of bequests. We need to see that the forgiveness of sins, the imparting of the divine life, the new birth, our crucifixion with Christ, justification, sanctification, perfection, glorification, and even the New Jerusalem are all bequests (Matt. 5:48; John 3:6; Rom. 3:24; 6:19; 8:11, 17; Gal. 2:20; 1 John 1:9; Rev. 21:2). We were crucified before we were born (Rom. 6:6). It was accomplished by Christ on the cross, and it is one of the many bequests itemized in the will. In the new testament, the new will, everything is a bequest which has been accomplished already. In the last portion of this new will, the book of Revelation, the apostle John uses the past tense very often. For example, in Revelation 20:10 John says that &ldquo;the devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,&rdquo; and in 21:2 he says, &ldquo;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&rdquo; Both of these statements are in the past tense because every item in the will is a bequest, not a promise. We must enjoy and partake of all the bequests itemized in the Lord&rsquo;s new will. If we have this view, we will be radically revolutionized. If we have seen this matter of the new testament, we will no longer pray in a begging way.</p>
<p>The Father promised everything, and the Lord Jesus accomplished everything. All the accomplished facts have been itemized in the new will as our bequests. We do not need to beg; we need to thank and praise the Lord for our bequests and enjoy them. If we know God&rsquo;s economy, we will praise the Lord and thank Him for all that He accomplished and bequeathed to us. We simply need to take with thanks to the Lord what has already been given to us in such an extraordinary way&mdash;in the way of the new will.</p>
<p>Nothing is as binding and as strongly established as a will. No one can change it. Whatever is bequeathed in a will is final; it must go to whom it is bequeathed. We should not be poor beggars&mdash;we should be glorious inheritors. An heir has no need to beg; he simply receives all the bequests with thanksgiving. When our eyes are opened to see this matter of the bequests in the new testament, our whole concept will be changed. Whenever we pray, we should pray with the realization that everything was already given to us nearly two thousand years ago as a bequest in the divine will and that we can take all that we need. We can boldly say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! This is ours, and we take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s new testament is executed by the resurrected Christ as the Mediator, the Executor, in the heavens. Today the resurrected Christ is executing this will by restfully interceding for us. The testament, the will, has been confirmed and validated by Christ&rsquo;s death and is being executed and enforced by Christ in His resurrection. The promise of God&rsquo;s covenant is insured by God&rsquo;s faithfulness, God&rsquo;s covenant is guaranteed by God&rsquo;s righteousness, and the new testament is enforced by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection power. Christ is now on the throne interceding for us to realize this testament, this will. The heavenly Intercessor is motivating and energizing us day by day that we may partake of all the riches of His will.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. His Sprinkled Blood<br />
Speaking Better Than That of Abel</h2>
<p>Hebrews 12:24, which speaks of Jesus as &ldquo;the Mediator of a new covenant,&rdquo; mentions &ldquo;the blood of sprinkling, which speaks something better than that of Abel.&rdquo; Abel is a type of Christ. The Lord Jesus is the real Feeder, the true Shepherd of God&rsquo;s people (John 10:11, 14; Heb. 13:20). Although not many people in the Bible are called righteous, both the Lord Jesus and Abel are called righteous. In Matthew 23:35 Abel is called &ldquo;righteous Abel&rdquo;; in Acts 7:52 and 22:14 the Lord Jesus is called the righteous One. Abel was killed by his brother in the flesh. Jesus also was killed by His Jewish brothers. Furthermore, both the blood of Abel and the blood of Jesus are a speaking blood. Genesis 4:10 says that the voice of Abel&rsquo;s blood cries unto God from the ground. The speaking of Abel&rsquo;s blood, however, is only a type of the speaking of the blood of Christ. In Hebrews 12:24, the fulfillment of the type in Genesis 4:10, we are told that the blood of Jesus is the &ldquo;blood of sprinkling, which speaks something better than that of Abel.&rdquo; Thank the Lord! We have not only the redeeming blood, the cleansing blood, and the covering blood, but also the speaking blood. Abel&rsquo;s blood spoke from the earth; Jesus&rsquo; blood speaks from heaven.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s sprinkled blood speaks better than that of Abel. Abel&rsquo;s blood speaks to God negatively for condemnation, accusation, and vengeance (vv. 10, 15), but the blood of Jesus speaks to God positively for better things, such as forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, and redemption.</p>
<p>The blood of Christ not only redeems, sanctifies, and purifies; it also speaks. This precious blood speaks to God for us, saying that by it the new covenant, which is eternal, has been enacted, and that in this new covenant God must give Himself and all His blessings to the believers in Christ, who receive this covenant by faith. Hence, it is called the blood of the eternal covenant (Heb. 10:29; 13:20).</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(85)</h1>
<h1 class="head3">100. The Unique Sacrifice and Offering</h1>
<p>In Hebrews 10:5-10 we see that Christ is the unique sacrifice and offering. In the Old Testament there are various kinds of sacrifices and offerings. A sacrifice dealt with sin and sins, whereas an offering was a gift to God for His pleasure. All the sacrifices and offerings in the Old Testament are types of Christ as the unique sacrifice and offering in the New Testament. Through Christ as the offerings, we and God, God and we, have a mutual enjoyment, the fellowship of co-enjoyment (Deut. 12:7).</p>
<p>According to the book of Hebrews, Christ, the ascended God-man, is our High Priest. In the Old Testament the duty of the high priest was to offer something to God, either a sacrifice or a gift, not only to make propitiation but also to please God. As sinners with a sinful nature and sinful deeds, we had a problem with God, and God had a problem with us. There was no peace between us and God. Something had to be done to appease the situation between us and God. Christ appeased this situation by making propitiation for us. Moreover, Christ did something to make God happy. God wanted to be happy with us, but our sins made Him unhappy. Before we were saved, God loved us, but He was not happy with us. Therefore, Christ offered Himself not only as a sacrifice for sin but also as a gift to please God and thereby make Him happy.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Prophesied in the Old Testament</h2>
<p>Christ as the unique sacrifice and offering in the New Testament was prophesied in the Old Testament. The New Testament is related to the Old Testament. This relationship is indicated by a portion of Hebrews 10:7: &ldquo;In the roll of the book it is written concerning Me.&rdquo; The &ldquo;roll of the book&rdquo; in this verse refers to the Old Testament. This indicates that the Old Testament gives us a full record of Christ, either by plain words or by types (Luke 24:27, 44, 46; John 5:39, 46). For example, Isaiah 53 predicted that Christ would come to be the sacrifice for sin, that is, to replace and terminate the Levitical sacrifices (vv. 6, 11-12).</p>
<p>In keeping with this, Psalm 40:6-8 says, &ldquo;You do not delight in sacrifice and offering; / You have prepared ears for Me; / You do not require burnt offering and sin offering. / Then I said, / Behold, I have come; / In the scroll of the book / It is written concerning Me. / I delight in doing Your will, O My God.&rdquo; The word in verses 6 through 8 is actually the word of Christ, as quoted by Paul in Hebrews 10:5-7. The prophecy in Psalm 40:6-8 is one of the greatest revelations concerning the all-inclusive Christ in the commission that God committed to Christ in His first coming through incarnation, which was to put away the animal sacrifices of the old covenant and to establish Himself, in His body, as the sacrifice of the new covenant. This is to terminate God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy and to initiate God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, in which Christ replaces all the offerings as well as all things, all matters, and all persons (cf. Matt. 17:4-8; Col. 2:16-17; 3:10-11).</p>
<p>In the prophecy in Psalm 40:6-8, Christ comes through His incarnation to terminate God&rsquo;s old economy and initiate God&rsquo;s new economy, His New Testament economy, by replacing the animal sacrifices and establishing Himself as the unique sacrifice of the new covenant. As such a sacrifice, Christ is the factor that enacts God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (Matt. 26:28) that He may be its centrality and universality for the producing and building up of the church as His organic Body, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Hence, Christ has changed the age for the consummating of God&rsquo;s new creation out of God&rsquo;s old creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). His changing of the age is greater than the creation of the universe mentioned in Genesis 1.</p>
<p>A sacrifice is for sin and sins before God, and an offering is for fellowship with God. These two things were the elements upon which the old covenant was established, and the old covenant was the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy in the Old Testament. God&rsquo;s not delighting in and not requiring sacrifice and offering points to the termination of His economy in the Old Testament. This is the importance and the greatness of this prophecy.</p>
<p>Psalm 40:6 says, &ldquo;You have prepared ears for Me.&rdquo; This was quoted by the apostle Paul in Hebrews 10:5 as &ldquo;a body You have prepared for Me.&rdquo; The boring of the slave&rsquo;s ears indicates that the master required the slave&rsquo;s obedience (Exo. 21:6). It signifies that God required obedience of Christ, who in His humanity was God&rsquo;s slave (Phil. 2:7). This obedience, spoken of by Paul in Philippians 2:8, was for Him to do the will of God by being the sacrifice and the offering in His crucifixion in the flesh, the body (Col. 1:22; Heb. 10:7-10). Based on this, Paul interpreted the boring of the ears as the preparing of a body, in which Christ offered Himself to God as the sacrifice and the offering to replace the sacrifice and the offering of animals in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Psalm 40:7 says, &ldquo;Behold, I have come,&rdquo; indicating Christ&rsquo;s first coming through His incarnation for the establishment of the new testament by Himself as the enacting sacrifice and offering. Verse 7 also says, &ldquo;In the scroll of the book / It is written concerning Me.&rdquo; This indicates that Christ was prophesied in the Scriptures of the Old Testament and that Christ will do God&rsquo;s will for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy according to the Old Testament prophecies concerning Him.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Taking Away All the Sacrifices and Offerings<br />
of the Old Testament and Establishing<br />
the New Testament Sacrifice and Offering</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 10:5-9, after quoting this prophecy concerning Christ in Psalm 40:6-8, Paul commented that Christ&rsquo;s coming to do God&rsquo;s will is to take away &ldquo;the first that He may establish the second&rdquo; (Heb. 10:9). <em>The first</em> in Paul&rsquo;s comment refers to the sacrifices and offerings of the first covenant, the old covenant; <em>the second</em> refers to the sacrifice of the second covenant, the new covenant, which sacrifice is Christ.</p>
<p>As the unique sacrifice and offering, Christ took away all the sacrifices and offerings of the old testament and established Himself as the new testament sacrifice and offering. Christ is our sacrifice to deal with sin and sins, and He is our offering, our gift, presented to God for God&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>In the old dispensation God commanded His people to offer to Him sacrifices and offerings. But when Jesus came and lived on this earth, God no longer delighted in those Old Testament offerings. Instead, it was God&rsquo;s will to replace them with Christ Himself. Christ came to be the real sacrifice and living offering, who offered Himself on the cross as the reality of all the offerings. He is the reality of the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering.</p>
<p>Actually, Christ came to replace all the Old Testament types. In other words, by Christ&rsquo;s first coming, the entire old testament was terminated and replaced. Now our offering and sacrifice are Christ. Day and night we offer Christ to God as all kinds of offerings. Whenever we sin, we ask God to forgive us, taking Christ, God&rsquo;s Son, as our sin offering and trespass offering. He is the real offering for our sin and transgressions. When we need peace toward God, we can take Christ as our peace offering. We can also take Him as our burnt offering and meal offering. Christ is everything to us because He fulfilled all the Old Testament types and has taken them away. Today He is the reality of all the types in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. To Do the Will of God</h2>
<p>Psalm 40:8 says, &ldquo;I delight in doing Your will.&rdquo; The will of God is to replace all the sacrifices and offerings in the Old Testament with Christ as the unique sacrifice and offering in the New Testament. This is the divine will ordained by God, revealed in the Old Testament prophecy. Hebrews 10:5-10 indicates that Christ is the reality of and the replacement for the Old Testament offerings. Verses 8 and 9 say, &ldquo;&lsquo;Sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not desire nor delight in&rsquo; (which are offered according to the law), He then has said, &lsquo;Behold, I have come to do Your will.&rsquo; He takes away the first that He may establish the second.&rdquo; The will of God here is to take away the first, the animal sacrifices of the old covenant, that the second, the sacrifice of Christ of the new testament, may be established. The new testament offerings are Christ Himself. Today God&rsquo;s desire and pleasure are not in animal sacrifices; God&rsquo;s desire and pleasure are altogether in one person&mdash;Christ.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s will is to have a Body as the enlargement and expression of the processed Triune God and to have Christ as the replacement for all the sacrifices and offerings that we may enjoy Him as our all in all. God&rsquo;s will is to have a Body for Christ. If we would be a part of the Body of Christ, which is the enlargement and expression of Christ, we need to take Christ as our everything and enjoy Him. The Body of Christ comes out of our enjoyment of Christ. The Old Testament saints were centered around the sacrifices and the offerings, which meant everything to them. However, Christ came to do God&rsquo;s will by replacing all the sacrifices and offerings in order that He could be everything to us. Now we can enjoy Christ as the reality, the body, of all the sacrifices and offerings. We daily need to practice taking and applying Christ as our sin offering and trespass offering, which will usher us into the enjoyment of Christ as the burnt offering and the meal offering, consummating in our enjoyment of Him as the peace offering plus the wave offering, heave offering, and drink offering.</p>
<p>The sin offering signifies that Christ was made sin for us that through His death on the cross, sin might be condemned (Lev. 4:3; 2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3; John 1:29; 3:14). The trespass offering signifies that Christ bore our sins in His own body and was judged by God on the cross to deal with our sinful deeds that we might be forgiven of our sinful conduct (Lev. 5:6; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18; Isa. 53:5-6, 10-11; John 4:15-18). The burnt offering, which was wholly for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, typifies Christ as God&rsquo;s pleasure and satisfaction, as the One whose living on earth was absolutely for God (Lev. 1:3; Num. 28:2-3; John 7:16-18). The meal offering typifies Christ in His humanity and in His human living, which was proper, even, tender, fine, balanced, pure, and sinless (Lev. 2:1, 4; John 7:46; 18:38; 19:4, 6). The peace offering typifies Christ as the Peacemaker, the One who became the peace and the fellowship between God and us by shedding His blood and dying for us, enabling us to enjoy Christ with God and to have fellowship with God in Christ for our mutual satisfaction with God (Lev. 3:1; Eph. 2:14-15; John 12:1-3; 20:21; Rev. 21:2). The wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ in love (Lev. 7:30; 10:15). The heave offering typifies the powerful Christ in ascension and exaltation (Lev. 7:32; Exo. 29:27; Eph. 1:21). The drink offering signifies Christ as the enjoyment of the offerer, enabling the offerer to be filled with Christ as the heavenly wine and even to become the wine offered to God for His enjoyment and satisfaction (Exo. 29:40; Num. 28:7-10; Isa. 53:12; Phil. 2:17; 2 Tim. 4:6; Judg. 9:13).</p>
<p>The reality of all the offerings is Christ realized as the Spirit (John 1:17; 14:6, 17). This means that in our experience the Spirit is the reality of the offerings. If we do not have the Spirit in a subjective way, we will not have the reality of the offerings but only the doctrine regarding Christ as the offerings. In Himself Christ is the reality of the offerings, but He cannot be this reality to us apart from His being the life-giving Spirit. The more we pray concerning Christ as the offerings with the realization that He is the life-giving Spirit, the more we will enjoy Him as the offerings. The way to enjoy Christ is to contact Him and take Him in as the Spirit of reality.</p>
<p>We need to live a life according to God&rsquo;s heart and will by daily enjoying Christ as the reality of all the offerings. This is for the fulfillment of the great will of God, which is to have Christ as the replacement for all the offerings in the Old Testament in order that we may enjoy Him as everything in living and practicing the Body life for the building up of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God (Eph. 1:5, 9, 11; Heb. 10:7-10; Rom. 12:2).</p><h2 class="head4">d. By the Will of God Our Having Been Sanctified through the Offering of<br />
the Body of Jesus Christ Once for All</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:10 tells us that by the will of God &ldquo;we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&rdquo; Christ offered His body once for all to replace all the sacrifices and offerings in the Old Testament with Himself in order to sanctify us unto God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">101. The Initiator of a New and Living Way</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:19-20 says, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.&rdquo; In these verses we see that Christ is the Initiator of a new and living way.</p>
<p>As the Initiator of a new and living way, Christ opened the way for us to enter the Holy of Holies by His blood through the veil, His flesh (v. 20). This refers to His death on the cross, which rent the veil in the temple to open a new and living way for Him to enter through His own blood into the Holy of Holies, where He is in the direct presence of God, ministering as our High Priest all that God is into our being as our life and life supply in the heavenly atmosphere. The Holy of Holies is the place within the veil, where we may enjoy Christ, ministering the riches of God in the heavenly atmosphere. When we receive such riches of the divine being into our being, we enjoy Christ as the Initiator of a new and living way.</p>
<p>The way into the Holy of Holies has been cut. According to the Greek, the word <em>new</em> in verse 20 means &ldquo;freshly slain.&rdquo; Through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, the way has been &ldquo;freshly slain&rdquo; for us. What was slain was not only the flesh but the entire old creation. In this verse the veil, which is His flesh, signifies the old creation, including us. On the veil were cherubim (Exo. 26:31), which signify the creatures (Ezek. 10:15). This indicates that in His flesh Christ bore all the creatures. When the veil was rent, the cherubim were also rent, signifying that when the flesh of Christ, which is typified by the veil, was crucified, all the creatures borne by Him were also crucified with His flesh. This flesh has been slain. According to Matthew 27:51, when the Lord Jesus died, the veil was split in two from top to bottom, meaning that it was not rent by anyone on earth but by God in the heavens. The old creation has been slain, and a new and living way to enter into the Holy of Holies has been cut. Now through the riven veil of the flesh and by the blood of Jesus, we can enter into the Holy of Holies. His death and His blood are still available to us today.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. To Enter into the Holy of Holies</h2>
<p>The Holy of Holies today is in heaven, where the Lord Jesus is (Heb. 9:12, 24). How, then, can we enter the Holy of Holies while we are still on earth? The secret is our spirit, referred to in 4:12. Christ who is in heaven is now also in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51), He joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Hence, whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies. There we meet with God, who is on the throne of grace (Heb. 4:16).</p>
<p>Through the better sacrifices of Christ, we have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies (9:23; 10:19). It is not a small thing to enter the Holy of Holies, for there God is sitting on the throne of grace. In order to enter into such a place, we must have boldness, and we have it by Christ&rsquo;s death and by His blood. By the Lord&rsquo;s death and His blood we have the boldness to enter the Holy of Holies at any time, unlike the high priest in the Old Testament, who could enter into it only once a year (9:25).</p>
<p>The Holy of Holies in Hebrews 10:19 refers to the Holy of Holies in our spirit. Our human spirit is the Holy of Holies, which is God&rsquo;s residence, the chamber in which God and Christ dwell. If we would find God and Christ, there is no need for us to go to heaven. God in Christ is so available, for He is in our spirit. The Holy of Holies in our spirit corresponds with the Holy of Holies in the heavens. In principle, these are two aspects, two ends, of one entity. Subjectively speaking, the Holy of Holies today is in our spirit. Therefore, we must discern our spirit from our soul (4:12) so that we may enter into the Holy of Holies, where Christ, the shekinah glory of God, and the presence of God are, where we can contact God, obtain mercy, and find grace as the flowing, living water for us to enjoy. This flowing, living water is simply the Spirit of grace who transmits the riches of Christ as grace into our spirit for our enjoyment to meet our timely need. This is the key to the experience of the things of Christ that are revealed in this book. Without the key of our spirit, Christ would only be objective to us, and we would have no way to enter into Him.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we need to have an objective vision of Christ as the One who is superior to Judaism in every aspect. On the other hand, we must realize that today He is the eternal Spirit, the Holy One, who brings Himself into our spirit. God the Father deals with us in our spirit, so in order to contact God, experience Christ, and realize the Spirit, we must discern our spirit from our soul. This means that we must always turn to the spirit and experience the dividing of our spirit from our soul. When we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies. Then we have Christ as the presence of God. We can contact God in all His fullness and enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the flow of the living water (Rev. 22:1-2). The tree of life is Christ as our grace, and the flow of living water is the transmitting Spirit.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention in His creation of man was that man would partake of the fruit of the tree of life and thereby receive the eternal life of God. But in the fall, Satan&rsquo;s evil nature was injected into man. As a result, man had to be barred from the tree of life. According to Genesis 3:24, Jehovah God &ldquo;drove the man out, and at the east of the garden of Eden He placed the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned in every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.&rdquo; Thus, man was estranged from the life of God. The cherubim, the flame, and the sword signify God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness. These three things kept sinful man from receiving eternal life. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He fulfilled all the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness. Therefore, through the redemption of the Lord Jesus, the way has been opened for us to contact the tree of life once more. The tree of life is in the Holy of Holies. As believers in Christ, we have been brought back to the tree of life. Now the divine life in the Holy of Holies may be our daily enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head4">b. By His Blood</h2>
<p>In Old Testament times only the high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies. Once a year he brought the atoning blood and sprinkled it upon the expiation cover. That was the old way. In Hebrews 10 we are told that now, in the New Testament age, there is a new way of entering into the Holy of Holies. This new way is not only for the high priest but for all believers, not by the blood of goats and bulls but by the blood of Jesus, and not through an unrent veil but through a veil that has been rent. Now we may pass through the rent veil, enter into the Holy of Holies, and go directly to the throne of grace.</p>
<p>The blood of Jesus opens the way for us to come into the Holy of Holies. Because the Lord has opened the way and brings us in, we may enjoy God in the Holy of Holies and daily be infused with Him. The living way, the way to the tree of life, has been opened by the blood of Jesus. This opened way has now become the new and living way for us to come into the Holy of Holies. Therefore, through the redeeming blood of Christ, we can once again enjoy the tree of life.</p>
<p>To enter the Holy of Holies is to come before God in order to contact God and pray to God. This is by means of the redeeming blood shed by the Lord Jesus on the cross that washes away all sins, which hinder our fellowship with God (1 John 1:3, 6-7). Through His blood, He has brought us before God so that we might become a new creation to take the new way. Because we are sinful in the old nature and in the flesh, there is no other way to enter into our spirit and remain in the spirit than through the blood of Christ.</p>
<p>If we are careless with God and our fellowship with Him, we may not sense that we are sinful. This is because regardless of how spiritual we may be, we are still in the old nature, the self, the soul, and the flesh. But if we care for our fellowship with the Lord and desire to enter into the Holy of Holies, we will immediately sense a condemnation within. If we mean business with the Lord to come into His presence, we will sense that we need the cleansing blood. Sometimes we may not sense a particular problem, but we may still have a general sense that we are dirty because we are still in the old nature. Therefore, we need the blood to cleanse us. It is through the blood and by the blood that we can enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, into our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Through the Veil, His Flesh</h2>
<p>The veil in Hebrews 10:20 is the second veil (9:3) within the tabernacle; this veil typifies the flesh of Christ. When Christ&rsquo;s flesh was crucified, this veil was rent (Matt. 27:51), thus opening the way for us, who were alienated from God, who is signified by the tree of life (Gen. 3:22-24), to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact Him and take Him as the tree of life for our enjoyment. This implies that because our old man was crucified with Christ, we have an open way to contact and enjoy God in our spirit as our life and life supply.</p>
<p>The way by which we enter into the Father is the crucified Jesus and resurrected Christ with His redemption (Heb. 10:19-20). When Jesus was crucified, the veil that separated man from God was rent from top to bottom. His crucifixion opened the way and made Him the way. Ephesians 2:18 says, &ldquo;Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&rdquo; This verse indicates that through Christ as the way we have access in the Spirit unto the Father. When we call upon the name of the Lord, we have the sense that we are in the presence of God and that God is within us. Today the Triune God is the life-giving Spirit. Actually, Christ as this life-giving Spirit is the access for us to touch God and enter into Him.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">102. The Author and Perfecter of Faith</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 12:2-3, Christ is revealed as the Author and Perfecter of faith. &ldquo;Looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God. For compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verse 2 speaks of Jesus as &ldquo;the Author and Perfecter of our faith.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;Author&rdquo; may be rendered &ldquo;Originator, Inaugurator, Leader, Pioneer, Forerunner.&rdquo; This is the same Greek word as in 2:10. All the overcoming saints in the Old Testament are only witnesses of faith, whereas Jesus is the Author of faith. He is the Originator, the Inaugurator, the source, and the cause of faith. In our natural man we have no believing ability. We do not have faith by ourselves. The faith by which we are saved is the precious faith that we have received from the Lord (2 Pet. 1:1). When we look unto Jesus, He as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) transfuses us with Himself, with His believing element. Then, spontaneously, a kind of believing arises in our being, and we have the faith to believe in Him. This faith is not of ourselves but of Him who imparts Himself as the believing element into us that He may believe for us. Hence, He Himself is our faith. We live by Him as our faith; that is, we live by His faith (Gal. 2:20), not by our own.</p>
<p>As the Author and the source of faith, Jesus is also the Leader, the Pioneer, and the Forerunner of faith. Jesus is the Author and the Originator of faith mainly in His life and in His path on earth. The Lord Jesus originated faith when He was here on earth. The life He lived was a life of faith, and the path He walked was a path of faith. In His life and path He originated faith. Hence, He is the Author of faith.</p>
<p>He cut the way of faith and, as the Forerunner, took the lead to pioneer it. Hence, He can carry us in His footsteps through the pathway of faith. As we look to Him as the Originator of faith in His life and in His path on earth, and as the Perfecter of faith in His glory and on His throne in heaven, He transfuses and even infuses us with the faith that He originated and perfected.</p>
<p>According to the revelation of the New Testament, faith is a wonderful matter. We may think that we human beings have faith. Actually, in ourselves we do not have faith; we have only unbelief. Unbelief is the fiber of our constitution. Hence, in ourselves it is impossible to meet the New Testament requirement of faith (1:16).</p>
<p>The saving faith is not of ourselves; &ldquo;it is the gift of God.&rdquo; Ephesians 2:8 tells us clearly that the faith through which we were saved is not of ourselves. We have received it as a gift from God. God is the source and Giver of faith, and we are the recipients of this divine gift. God has put something into our being which becomes our faith. Second Peter 1:1 says that we &ldquo;have been allotted faith equally precious.&rdquo; Faith is precious because it has been given to us as a gift by God. The more we turn to God and contact Him, the more faith we have.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament revelation, faith is simply Christ Himself. Because Christ Himself is faith, the apostle Paul speaks of the faith of Jesus Christ (Rom. 3:22), the faith of the Son of God (Gal. 2:20), or faith in Christ (Phil. 3:9). Faith, which is the unique requirement of the New Testament, is Christ Himself being transfused into us to become our element and ability to believe in Him and in all the divine, spiritual, and heavenly things. Hence, faith is the faith in Christ as well as the faith of Christ. In other words, faith is simply Christ Himself as our believing element and ability.</p>
<p>How is Christ as faith infused into us? In the proper preaching of the gospel, Christ is presented to us as a figure in a scenery. In such a presentation we see Christ as a living figure, a wonderful person. A proper preaching of the gospel is a presentation of Christ as a living person whom we may look upon. When we look upon Him, He as the living person is impressed into us, not merely into our mind and heart but also into the deepest part of our being, our spirit. When we are impressed with Christ as a figure, an appreciation of this figure is spontaneously produced within us. When Christ as the living figure is infused into our mind and our heart, eventually reaching our spirit, He becomes precious to us, and we desire to accept and receive Him. This is faith, or believing. We are infused with this believing element and ability, and we call upon the name of the Lord. When we hear the gospel and see Christ as a living person in a divine scenery, our appreciation of, and reaction to, Christ as a wonderful figure arises within us. This is the living Jesus infused into us to become our faith. Therefore, He is the Author of our faith; He is the origin and the origination of our believing element and ability.</p>
<p>Faith, the substantiating ability, is like a sixth sense. We acquired this substantiating sense through the preaching of the gospel. Proper gospel preaching is not merely a matter of teaching; it must also be a matter of transfusion. In order to preach the gospel to sinners, we must first receive something of and from the Lord. Then, as we are preaching, what we have received of the Lord will enter, like electricity, into those who are listening. While we are speaking and the people are looking at and listening to us, something spontaneously and unconsciously will be transfused into them. Although they may shake their heads, not consenting to our preaching, deep within they will believe what we are saying. Although some may say to themselves that it is silly to believe, something within them will continue to react and bring them to the point where they say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, thank You. You are so good. Lord, You are my Savior.&rdquo; Because some element has been transfused into their being, they will be able to believe in the Lord. This is the result of the transfusion of faith by God through a preacher.</p>
<p>Every gospel preacher must be a charming person. He must first be charmed himself and then he will be able to charm others. What he says may not seem logical, but like a battery that is being charged, the hearers will be charmed. For this reason, the church must pray a great deal for the preaching of the gospel. The more we pray, the more charming the gospel meeting will be. The gospel preacher must pray until he has a heavenly charm and is fully charged with the divine element. If he is charged and charming, as he stands in front of the people, he will have the sense that something is being transfused into them. Some element is infused into them through that charming preacher. This infused element is faith.</p>
<p>This principle applies not only to the preaching of the gospel but to other forms of ministry as well. Ministry depends upon our utterance, which is the release of the divine element. If our ministry is proper, we will be charmed and charming whenever we come to minister. The proper ministry is altogether a matter of being fully transfused with God Himself. First, we are charged with the divine element, and then in the ministry we radiate that divine element into others in a charming way. This is altogether a matter of God&rsquo;s grace. God&rsquo;s grace is simply God Himself dispensed into us to meet our need. Sinners certainly need to have faith, but how can they have it? Naturally, we have no belief, only disbelief. But when the sinners come to the church and hear the proper preaching of the gospel, they are charged with God. God Himself as the heavenly electricity is transmitted into them. Because God Himself is transfused into them in this way, they find that they have faith. This is the gift of faith, the nature and element of which are God Himself.</p>
<p>Once such faith is generated within us, it can never be removed from us. Even if we try to deny the Lord, we ultimately find ourselves unable to do so, for Christ as faith has been infused into our being. For example, on the night that the Lord Jesus was arrested by the Jews, Peter denied Him three times in His presence (Luke 22:47-61). However, Christ as the believing element and ability was still in Peter. As the Lord petitioned, his faith ultimately did not fail (v. 32). We may have similar experiences of denying the Lord temporarily. At times we may be swayed by our human feeling and understanding and deny the Lord temporarily. Yet while we are denying Him, nevertheless there remains the believing element and ability deep within us, which nothing and no one can remove. This is Christ Himself infused into us as precious faith (2 Pet. 1:1). All the believers, from the greatest to the least, have such a faith. This faith, which is precious to us and common to all the believers, is the base of all spiritual blessings. It is upon this base that we have been blessed and have received all the spiritual, divine, and heavenly things prepared by God.</p>
<p>We live by His faith, by Him as our faith (Gal. 2:20). Genuine believing is to believe in the Lord Jesus by His faith. We believe in Jesus Christ by His faith, for we have no faith of our own, and He is the Author of our faith. Therefore, faith is not our invention; it cannot be initiated by us. It is impossible for us to generate faith. Faith is an aspect of Christ Himself, and apart from Christ we have no faith of our own. We do not live by our own faith but by the faith of the Son of the living God who has faith and who Himself is faith to us. Such faith issues from our knowing and appreciating Christ. If we look at ourselves, we will never find faith. But if we forget ourselves, turn to the Lord Jesus, and call on Him, faith will immediately rise up within us. The more we abide in Him, the more we are infused with Him as our faith. This faith is the faith of Christ; it is Christ believing within us.</p>
<p>Faith is simply the Lord Jesus Christ. He is not only the Author, the Originator, of faith but also the Perfecter, the Finisher, of faith. He will finish what He originated; He will complete what He inaugurated. If we look to Him continually, He will finish and complete the faith that we need for the running of the heavenly race. Once Christ has originated this faith within us, He will never let it go. Rather, He will complete, finish, and perfect it. As the Completer of faith, He is continually infused into us as the believing element and ability when we pray to the Lord, fellowship with Him, pray over the Bible, attend church meetings, listen to spiritual messages, and read spiritual books. Hence, our faith in Jesus Christ comes from Him; in fact, it is Christ Himself continually infused into us. Such faith brings us into an organic union with Christ; it also continually increases this organic union. The increase of our organic union with Him is the increase, the growth, of Christ within us. The more Christ is infused into us as the believing element and ability, the more He is growing in us. This is our faith being perfected by the Lord. In this sense, our faith has not yet been fully perfected. Day by day our faith will be under the Lord&rsquo;s perfecting until we meet Him on the day of rapture. For this reason, Paul calls Him the Author and Perfecter of our faith. We need to pursue the Lord to experience and enjoy Him in this aspect day by day and even moment by moment.</p><h2 class="head4">a. For the Joy Set before Him<br />
He Enduring the Cross, Despising the Shame</h2>
<p>According to Hebrews 12:2, for the joy set before Him, Jesus endured the cross, despising the shame. The Lord Jesus knew that through His death He would be glorified in resurrection (Luke 24:25-26) and that His divine life would be released to produce many brothers for His expression (John 12:23-24; Rom. 8:29). For the joy set before Him, He despised the shame (Heb. 12:2) and volunteered to be delivered to the Satan-usurped leaders of the Jews and condemned by them to death. Therefore, God exalted Him to the heavens, seated Him at His right hand (Mark 16:19; Acts 2:33-35), gave Him the name which is above every name (Phil 2:9-10), made Him both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), and crowned Him with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. He Being Seated at the Right Hand<br />
of the Throne of God</h2>
<p>Hebrews 12:2 tells us that Christ &ldquo;has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo; In His ascension Christ was seated on the throne of God&rsquo;s government. In His ascension He was enthroned in heaven.</p>
<p>From 1:3 the book of Hebrews points us continually to the Christ seated in heaven. In all his other Epistles Paul presents to us mainly the Christ who dwells in our spirit (Rom. 8:10; 2 Tim. 4:22) as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to be our life and our everything. But in this book he points us particularly to the Christ who has sat down in heaven and who is of so many aspects, that He may care for us in every way. In Paul&rsquo;s other Epistles the indwelling Christ is versus our flesh, self, and natural man. In this book the heavenly Christ is contrasted to the earthly religion and all earthly things. To experience the indwelling Christ, we need to turn to our spirit and contact Him. To enjoy the heavenly Christ, we need to look away from all things on earth unto Him, who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God. By His death and resurrection He accomplished everything that is needed by both God and man. Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens, in the person of the Son of God (Heb. 1:5) and the Son of Man (2:6), in the person of God (1:8) and man (2:6), as the appointed Heir of all things (1:2), the anointed One of God (v. 9), the Author of our salvation (2:10), the Sanctifier (v. 11), the constant Succor (v. 16), the instant Helper (4:16), the Apostle from God (3:1), the High Priest (2:17; 4:14; 7:26), the Minister of the true tabernacle (8:2) with a more excellent ministry (v. 6), the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant (7:22; 8:6; 12:24), the Executor of the new testament (9:16-17), the Forerunner (6:20), the Author and Perfecter of faith (12:2), and the great Shepherd of the sheep (13:20). If we look to Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He will minister heaven, life, and strength to us, transfusing and infusing us with all that He is, that we may be able to run the heavenly race and live the heavenly life on earth. In this way He will carry us through all the lifelong pathway and lead and bring us into glory (2:10).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Our Needing to Look Away unto Him and<br />
to Compare Him Who Has Endured Such Contradiction<br />
by Sinners against Himself,<br />
So That We May Not Grow Weary,<br />
Fainting in Our Souls</h2>
<p>Hebrews 12:2 also speaks of &ldquo;looking away unto Jesus.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;looking away unto&rdquo; denotes &ldquo;looking with undivided attention by turning away from every other object.&rdquo; The Hebrew believers had to look away from all the things in their environment&mdash;away from their old religion, Judaism, and its persecution, and away from all earthly things&mdash;that they might look unto Jesus, who is now seated on the right hand of the throne of God in the heavens.</p>
<p>The wonderful Jesus, who is enthroned in heaven and crowned with glory and honor (2:9), is the greatest attraction in the universe. He is like an immense magnet, drawing all His seekers to Him. It is by being attracted by His charming beauty that we look away from all things other than Him. Without such a charming object, how could we look away from so many distracting things on this earth? When we look away unto Jesus, we see Him, and He is infused into us.</p>
<p>In order to learn to walk by faith and suffer by faith, we need to look away from all things and persons. Jesus is the origin and the completion of our faith. We need to look away unto Jesus. This is because only Jesus is. All the others are not. Anyone other than Jesus is nothing. We trust in the Lord; we do not trust in anyone else. Hence, we need to look away from all things which are not and unto Jesus who is. This is faith.</p>
<p>If we would have faith, we must look away unto Jesus, the source of faith. When we look away from all other things unto Him, He will radiate Himself into us, charging us with Himself. As a result, spontaneously we will have faith. Faith is Christ Himself believing for us in a very subjective way. He transfuses us with Himself, working Himself into us, until He, a living person, becomes the believing element in our being. In this way He makes us a believing being.</p>
<p>When we look away unto Christ, we give Him the opportunity and the freedom to work Himself into us as the law of life (Rom. 8:2). In this way the law of life can work in every inward part of our being until we are fully saturated with Him. The more we are saturated with Him, the easier it is to believe. This is the way to have faith.</p>
<p>It is through the law of life that Christ&rsquo;s believing element is charged into our being. The more we allow the law of life to work in our being, the more we are able to believe. If we give the law of life the opportunity to work continuously in our mind, emotion, and will, its working will produce great faith in us. Faith is the firstfruits of the working of the law of life in our being.</p>
<p>As the law of life works within us to bring about the expression and testimony of God, the first issue of its working is our believing. The most believing person is the one in whom the law of life has worked the most. Such a person will have the faith to believe God to the uttermost without any strain or strife. His believing is spontaneous because it comes from the working of the law of life within him. When the law of life operates within us to make us the reflection, expression, and testimony of God, we find it easy to believe. May we all experience faith in such a subjective way by looking away unto Jesus.</p>
<p>Hebrews 12:3 says, &ldquo;For compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls.&rdquo; This short word refers us to the four Gospels, where we see how Christ endured such contradiction from sinners. At that time, the sinners were all the religionists, Judaizers, priests, scribes, and elders of the people. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He confronted all these opposers who were doing their best to frustrate or stop Him from the way of God&rsquo;s new covenant. But He was not frustrated; rather, He cut the way, slaying it by suffering the death of the cross.</p>
<p>We should not only look away unto Jesus but also compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself so that we may not grow weary, fainting in our souls. This indicates that the Christian walk is a way full of suffering, shame, and contradiction. To believe in Jesus Christ (Gal. 2:16) is a marvelous blessing, but this brings us to a way not only of peace and grace but also of suffering, shame, and contradiction. This is the way that Jesus took when He lived on the earth. In His human living, He suffered and was put to shame and contradicted by sinners, but all the while He looked away to the throne in the heavens.</p>
<p>We must learn of the Lord Jesus as our pattern. As we take the Christian way, which is full of suffering, shame, and contradiction, we should look away unto Jesus. When we look away unto Him, He is perfecting, finishing, the faith within us, infusing Himself into us as the believing element and ability. In our human life, we cannot avoid encountering many problems. Yet we should not look at these problems, for they are not worth looking at. Rather, we need to look away from all our problems unto Jesus and compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself. When we look away unto Him, we will receive the infusion of the believing element and ability. In this way, we will be happy and be rescued inwardly from all our problems and contradictions.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">103. The One Who Remains the Same</h2>
<p>In Hebrews 13, Christ is presented as the One who remains the same.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. His Being the Same Yesterday, Today, and Forever</h2>
<p>Hebrews 13:8 says, &ldquo;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, yes, even forever.&rdquo; We should remember that the writer of the book of Hebrews spoke this word after Christ ascended to the heavens. Before His ascension He underwent changes; that is, He passed through processes. In eternity past, Christ was only the Son of God, not the Son of Man. He did not have humanity, the flesh. However, in His incarnation Christ underwent a change, picking up humanity and putting the flesh upon Himself (John 1:1, 14). Christ then passed through death and entered into resurrection. In resurrection He, as the last Adam, was transfigured into the life-giving Spirit. Thus, He changed to become that which had not been&mdash;the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). After passing through all His processes, including incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, Christ, the embodiment of God, is now processed and consummated. For Jesus Christ to remain the same yesterday, today, and forever does not mean that Christ remains unprocessed from eternity past, through time, and into eternity future. Rather, by passing through the processes, Christ underwent many changes. Yet since He went through and completed the processes, He is now processed and consummated, possessing divinity, humanity, human living, the all-inclusive crucifixion, the all-surpassing resurrection, and the all-transcending ascension. As the Christ who has been processed and consummated, He remains the same and will remain the same forever.</p>
<p>Christ, who is the word that the ministers of the word of God in Hebrews 13:7 preached and taught, who is the life that they lived, and who is the Author and Perfecter of their faith, is perpetual, unchangeable, and unchanging. He remains the same forever (1:11-12). There must not be another Jesus and another gospel preached in the church (2 Cor. 11:4; Gal. 1:8-9). For a true and steadfast church life, we must hold on to the Christ who is the same yesterday and today, and even forever, and we must not be carried away by various strange teachings (Heb. 13:9).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Suffering outside the Gate<br />
That He Might Sanctify the People<br />
through His Own Blood</h2>
<p>Hebrews 13:12 says, &ldquo;Therefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.&rdquo; The expression <em>the gate</em> is the gate of the city of Jerusalem. The Lord Jesus was crucified in Golgotha, which is outside the city of Jerusalem (John 19:17-20). The people of God rejected Him, the sent One of God. Even though He is the Son of God, the children of Israel had Him crucified outside the city. Christ&rsquo;s body was carried outside the gate. There He suffered death so that He might sanctify the people through His own blood.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s body suffered the death of the cross outside the gate, and His blood was brought into the Holy of Holies for our sanctification (Heb. 13:11-12). The book of Hebrews unveils to us that God&rsquo;s heavenly calling is to make us a holy people (3:1), a people sanctified unto God. Christ is the Sanctifier (2:11). He suffered death on the cross, shedding His blood, and entered the Holy of Holies with His blood (9:12) that by the heavenly ministry (8:2, 6) of His heavenly priesthood (7:26) He might be able to do a sanctifying work and that we might enter within the veil by His blood to participate in Him as the heavenly Sanctifier. By participating in Him in this way, we are enabled to follow Him outside the camp on the sanctifying pathway of the cross.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s blood, through which He entered into the Holy of Holies (9:12), opened the new and living way, enabling us to enter within the veil to enjoy Him in the heavens as the glorified One (10:19-20). His body, which was sacrificed for us on the cross, cut the narrow way of the cross, enabling us to go outside the camp to follow Him on earth as the suffering One (13:13).</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:11-12 tells us that Jesus as the sin offering suffered outside the gate: &ldquo;For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy of Holies for sin by the high priest are burned up outside the camp. Therefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.&rdquo; Since Jesus suffered outside the gate, those of us who enjoy Him as the sin offering must also be outside the gate. We must follow Him outside of the world and any religious camp. We must be outside of any religious organization and any kind of worldly organization. Christ was judged there, and that is also our place. The more we are outside the gate, the more we are in the place where Jesus was &ldquo;burned to ashes.&rdquo; Then we can truly enjoy Him and praise Him for the blood and the ashes. We are on the same standing as the ashes. We are the followers of Christ, who have left the camp. We are not in any kind of worldly or religious organization. The redeeming Jesus has led us out of all these things. Now all we see is the blood and the ashes. Those who follow Jesus out of the camp also become ashes. We are nothing but ashes following Jesus. This is the full enjoyment of Christ as the sin offering.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Our Going Forth unto Him outside the Camp,<br />
Bearing His Reproach</h2>
<p>Hebrews 13:13 says, &ldquo;Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.&rdquo; The gate in verse 12 refers to the city of Jerusalem, which signifies the earthly realm, while the camp in verse 13 refers to the tabernacle, which signifies human organization. Together, the two signify one thing, the Jewish religion with its two aspects, the earthly and the human. Judaism is both earthly and human. Christ was crucified outside the governmental gate, the gate of the city of Jerusalem, but we need to follow Him outside the religious camp, bearing His reproach. This means that we are passing through the process of suffering that He underwent. As suffering ones, we will become the same as He is.</p>
<p>If we would be proper Christians, we must experience Christ in the way of going outside the camp to bear His reproach, following Him in the sanctifying pathway of the cross. We must experience Christ in this particular aspect. If we would experience Him in this aspect, we must enter &ldquo;within the veil&rdquo; (6:19-20), that is, into the Holy of Holies, to enjoy Him as our heavenly Sanctifier in His heavenly priesthood (10:19-20).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside the camp&rdquo; and &ldquo;within the veil&rdquo; (13:13; 6:19) are two very striking points in the book of Hebrews. To enter within the veil means to enter into the Holy of Holies, where the Lord is enthroned in glory, and to go outside the camp means to come out of religion, whence the Lord was cast in rejection. This signifies that we must be in our spirit, where experientially the practical Holy of Holies is today, and outside religion, where the practical camp is today. The more we are in our spirit, enjoying the heavenly Christ, the more we will come outside the camp of religion, following the suffering Jesus. Being in our spirit to enjoy the glorified Christ enables us to come outside the camp of religion to follow the rejected Jesus. The more we remain in our spirit to contact the heavenly Christ, who is in glory, the more we will go forth outside the camp of religion unto the lowly Jesus to suffer with Him. By contacting Christ in the heavens and enjoying His glorification, we are energized to take the narrow pathway of the cross on earth and bear the reproach of Jesus.</p>
<p>First, the book of Hebrews gives us a clear vision of the heavenly Christ and the heavenly Holy of Holies, and then it shows us how to walk on the earth in the pathway of the cross, that is, how to go forth unto Jesus outside the camp, outside religion, bearing His reproach. Even Moses, after the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf (Exo. 32), moved to a place outside the camp, where everyone who sought the Lord went to meet with him, for both the Lord&rsquo;s presence and the Lord&rsquo;s speaking were there (33:7-11). We must go outside the camp so that we may enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence and hear His speaking. Our spirit must be in the heavens with Christ, and our steps must be with Jesus outside the camp of religion. All these things are necessary for the practical and proper church life.</p>
<p>Christ is our offering, our portion offered to God for us on the altar of the cross. The way to enjoy Him as our portion is twofold. On the one hand, we enjoy the ascended Christ in the heavens in our spirit, and on the other hand, we need to follow His steps outside the camp and bear His reproach. In these two ways we fully enjoy Him as our portion. The way to enjoy Him is by entering the veil and going outside the camp. To enter the veil is to enjoy the heavenly Christ in our spirit, and to go outside the camp is to give up organized religion to follow Jesus. There is no other way to fully enjoy Him. The more we enjoy Him as the heavenly Melchizedek in our spirit, the more we will step outside the camp and give up organized religion.</p>
<p>To bear the Lord&rsquo;s reproach means that we bear the same reproach He bore; it is to bear His disgrace or shame. Further, to bear His reproach is to bear the cross (Matt. 16:24). The more we are despised, the happier we should be because we are bearing the cross. The reproach He suffered now becomes our reproach. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He suffered reproach from religion. Now as His followers, we must bear His reproach, suffering reproach from religion. This is to be a joint partaker of the tribulation in Jesus (Rev. 1:9). This is the only way for us to follow Him and enjoy Him as our portion. This is the way of faith, the way of the cross, which is the narrow pathway for us to enjoy Christ in a practical way. May the Lord be gracious to us that we may practice this.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we are within the veil; on the other hand, we are outside the city, the camp. On one hand, we are in the Holy of Holies; on the other hand, we are before men. Inwardly, we enjoy the resurrected Christ, and outwardly, we follow Jesus. When we pray in our room in the morning, we contact Christ. This can be likened to the Shulammite and Solomon living and fellowshipping together in the palaces of ivory (Psa. 45:8; S. S. 1:4). We touch the Lord in the inner chamber, in the Holy of Holies, in the secret place. When we testify for the Lord and work for the Lord in our outward living, we can be likened to Abigail, wandering with David in the wilderness (1 Sam. 25:39-42).</p>
<p>Every day we experience these two aspects. On the one hand, we are within the veil as the Shulammite, living in the Holy of Holies and enjoying the resurrected and glorified Christ, the One greater than Solomon (Matt. 12:42). On the other hand, we are outside the camp as Abigail, living in the world and following the lowly Jesus (v. 3). Like the Shulammite, we inwardly remain in the palaces of ivory and fellowship with the Lord, the real Solomon, and like Abigail, we outwardly live and work by following the Lord, the real David, to war and suffering. The One within is the resurrected Christ, whereas the One without is Jesus the Nazarene. Inwardly, we have the enjoyment of the Shulammite in the secret place, and outwardly, we have the public living of Abigail.</p>
<p>We not only enjoy the resurrected Christ within, but we follow the suffering Jesus without. Our colleagues, relatives, neighbors, and friends may persecute and trouble us when we testify for the Lord. At such times, we are outwardly walking on a narrow way similar to that of Jesus the Nazarene. Nevertheless, when people trouble, persecute, oppose, and harass us, we enjoy the resurrected Christ inwardly.</p>
<p>Philippians 3:10 says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; As far as Christ is concerned, He first experienced suffering and then resurrection. As far as we are concerned, we touch resurrection and then experience suffering. He died and then resurrected, but we resurrect and then die. No one can take the way of the cross by himself; neither can he follow the footsteps of Jesus the Nazarene by himself. It is not until a person touches and contacts the resurrected Christ within and the resurrected Christ enters into him that he can say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). It is the resurrected Christ in us who leads us to follow the suffering Jesus. He has walked the way of the cross and entered into us in resurrection. Now He is leading us to take the way of the cross.</p>
<p>When we enter within the veil by entering into our spirit, we taste the sweetness of the heavenly Christ so that we may be enabled to go outside the camp, forsaking the earth and its love. As we stay within the veil, we also have our spirit filled with the glory of the heavenly Christ so that our heart may be freed from the possession of the earth&rsquo;s enjoyment outside the camp. Furthermore, within the veil we behold the glorified Christ so that we may be attracted to follow the suffering Jesus outside the camp. Beholding His countenance in heaven enables us to trace His footsteps on earth. As we enter within the veil, we are infused with resurrection power (Phil. 3:10) so that we may be empowered to walk the pathway of the cross outside the camp. We also participate in the ministry of the heavenly Christ so that we may be equipped to minister Him to the thirsty spirits outside the camp. Here we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s best so that we may be enriched to meet the needs of people outside the camp.</p>
<p>The Holy of Holies, the pathway of the cross (signified by the going forth unto Jesus outside the camp, bearing His reproach), and the kingdom are three crucial matters set forth in the book of Hebrews. The Holy of Holies with its rich supply enables us to take the narrow, difficult pathway of the cross, and the pathway of the cross ushers us into the kingdom in its manifestation so that we may obtain the reward of glory.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Through Him Our Offering Up<br />
a Sacrifice of Praise Continually to God</h2>
<p>Hebrews 13:15 says, &ldquo;Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name.&rdquo; This verse presents a profound thought. When we bear the reproach of Jesus and suffer on His behalf, we often groan and do not offer any praise to God. Yet the writer of the book of Hebrews tells us that when we pass through reproach and suffering, we should continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God.</p>
<p>Verse 15 is a continuation of verses 8 through 14. Since in the church life we enjoy the unchanging Christ as grace and follow Him outside religion, we should offer through Him spiritual sacrifices to God. First, in the church we should offer up through Him a sacrifice of praise to God continually. In the church He sings in us hymns of praise unto God the Father (2:12). In the church we too should praise God the Father through Him. Eventually, in the church He and we, we and He, praise the Father together in the mingled spirit. Christ as the life-giving Spirit, praises the Father in our spirit, and we, by our spirit, praise the Father in His Spirit. This is the best and highest sacrifice that we can offer to God through Him. This is greatly needed in the church meetings.</p>
<p>Through the Christ whom we have experienced and enjoyed, we need to offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually. The real praise in the meetings must be constituted of our experiences of Christ. The sweetest praises we can offer to the Father are those we offer to Christ and which concern Christ. There is nothing more pleasant to the Father&rsquo;s heart than this. Real worship to the Father is the offering of His Son. In the preaching of the gospel, we tell the sinners that Christ is the Son of God, who redeemed us and who can save us and bring us to the Father. If we minister these things regarding Christ to the unbelievers, this is real worship to the Father. To worship God the Father is simply to present the Son of God. The real praise to the Father comes out of our experience of Christ in our daily life. This is a very pleasing praise to the Father, gladdening and rejoicing His heart. The Father desires that we glorify Him with the Son. If we glorify the Son, we glorify the Father. When we glorify the Son, the Father is glorified in His Son&rsquo;s being glorified by us (John 17:1). The praises out of our experience and enjoyment of Christ&mdash;the spiritual praises about Christ&mdash;are the best praise to the Father.</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:16 goes on to tell us about &ldquo;doing good and sharing with others.&rdquo; <em>Doing good</em> refers to giving, and <em>fellowshipping</em> refers to sharing, that is, having fellowship in the needs of the saints. This kind of doing good and fellowshipping with others also are sacrifices that we should offer to God. These too are necessary for a proper church life. It is truly improper if in the church some needy saints are not well cared for and ministered to. This means that the fellowship with others is absent or inadequate.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. God Having Raised Him as<br />
the Great Shepherd of the Sheep from the Dead<br />
by the Blood of an Eternal Covenant</h2>
<p>Hebrews 13:20 says, &ldquo;Now the God of peace, He who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant.&rdquo; The sheep here are the flock, which is the church. This confirms the view that the things covered in Hebrews 13, with the experience of the unchanging Christ as our sin offering, through whom we were redeemed, and as our great Shepherd, by whom we are now being fed, are all for the church life. Today Christ as the High Priest is the Shepherd who takes care of us for the church as we pass through the sufferings of Christ (1 Pet. 4:13).</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:20 speaks of the eternal covenant. The book of Hebrews does not concern temporal things, such as the things of the old covenant, but eternal things, things that are beyond the limit of time and space, such as eternal salvation (5:9), eternal judgment (6:2), eternal redemption (9:12), the eternal Spirit (v. 14), the eternal inheritance (v. 15), and the eternal covenant (13:20). The new covenant is not only a better covenant (7:22; 8:6) but also an eternal covenant. It is eternally effective because of the eternal efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s blood, with which it was enacted (Matt. 26:28; Luke 22:20).</p>
<p>The eternal covenant is the covenant of the new testament to gain a flock, which is the church issuing in the Body and consummating the New Jerusalem. The eternal covenant of God is to consummate the New Jerusalem by the shepherding. God raised up our Lord from the dead to be the great Shepherd to consummate the New Jerusalem according to God&rsquo;s eternal covenant.</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:20 indicates that it was by the blood of the eternal covenant that God raised Christ from the dead. All that God has ordained has been covenanted to be our portion. This portion is actually God Himself with His nature, life, attributes, and virtues. It is through the blood of the covenant that God becomes our portion. The blood of the covenant brings us into God, into the divine life and nature, into the inward law of life and the ability of life to know God, and into the infusion, transfusion, and enjoyment of God both now and in eternity. This is the function of the blood of the covenant.</p>
<p>The blood of the covenant is not mainly for forgiveness; it is primarily for God to be our portion. God has ordained and predestinated us to enjoy Him. This enjoyment has also been covenanted to us. This covenant was enacted by the blood of Jesus Christ, the blood which brings us into all the divine blessings. According to Matthew 26:28, the Lord Jesus took the cup and said, &ldquo;This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; According to Luke 22:20, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant established in My blood.&rdquo; In 1 Corinthians 10:16 Paul refers to the cup as the &ldquo;cup of blessing.&rdquo; This cup of blessing is the covenant enacted by the blood. The blood of the new covenant is the blood which enacted the covenant of blessing. The covenant is the cup and also the blessing as our portion. This portion is God Himself for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>The blood is spoken of in Exodus 12 and 24 and Leviticus 16. In Exodus 12 we see the blood of the passover lamb for redemption; in Exodus 24 we see the blood of the sacrifices for the enactment of the law; and in Leviticus 16 we see the blood of the expitiation by which man could enter into the Holy of Holies, contact God, and be one with Him. In the New Testament we see that the Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross. This is typified by the blood of the passover lamb in Exodus 12. With the blood shed on the cross, the Lord enacted the new testament. This is typified by the blood in Exodus 24. Ultimately, the blood of Christ brings us into the fullness of God as our eternal enjoyment. This aspect of the blood, the blood of the eternal covenant, is typified by the blood in Leviticus 16.</p>
<p>The blood brings us into the Holy of Holies; that is, it brings us into God. When the high priest entered into the Holy of Holies, it was not his purpose to observe the law. On the contrary, because of the blood sprinkled in the Holy of Holies, he could enjoy God, behold His beauty, and receive His infusion. Enjoying God in this way is what produces a man of God.</p>
<p>In Revelation 7 those who have &ldquo;washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb&rdquo; are before the throne of God, in the temple of God, and are brought to springs of waters of life (vv. 14-17). Furthermore, 22:14 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city.&rdquo; Here we see that through the washing of the blood, we have the right to come to the tree of life and enter into the city, New Jerusalem. The tree of life and the city are the ultimate aspects of God as our portion. If we view the Bible as a whole, we will see that the blood of the covenant brings us into the full enjoyment of God as our portion both now and forever.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. Through Him God Doing in Us<br />
That Which Is Well Pleasing in His Sight</h2>
<p>Hebrews 13:21 tells us that through Christ the God of peace is &ldquo;doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo; God is doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ that we may be able to do His will. God works in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure (Phil. 2:13). From beginning to end, the book of Hebrews presents to us a heavenly Christ. Only in 13:20-21, with the expression <em>God...doing in us...through Jesus Christ,</em> does this book imply the indwelling of Christ. It is through the indwelling Christ that God works in us so that we can do His will.</p>
<p>Through Jesus Christ God does in us that which is well pleasing in His sight. This means that God is working in us. Not only is God leading us to go outside the camp to bear the reproach of Christ; He is also working within us that which is well pleasing in His sight in order that we would live a life according to His pleasure.</p>
<p>In verse 21 Jesus Christ is the subjective Christ. This indicates that God must work within us subjectively through Jesus Christ. This conclusion impresses us that all the teachings within the book of Hebrews are for the subjective work of God within us.</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:21 indicates that the great, wonderful, and inexhaustible Christ is now in us. This Christ in us is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). As the Spirit within us, He is always available and easy to experience. If we would simply pray a little, we would pray ourselves into our spirit to touch this One and enjoy Him. He is inexhaustible yet available. As we enjoy the aspects of Christ as revealed in the book of Hebrews, we will be led into the experience of His humanity, His divinity, His death, His resurrection, and His ascension, and we will grow in Him in all these aspects. The book of Hebrews reveals many wonderful aspects of Christ for our experience and enjoyment. It will take our entire lifetime and even eternity for us to enjoy all these aspects of what Christ is to us.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(88)</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in 1 Peter. Although 1 Peter is a short book, it reveals many rich aspects of Christ for our experience and enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head3">104. The Element of Christian Experience</h2>
<p>First Peter 1 presents Christ as the element of Christian experience in its totality.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. His Blood Having Been Sprinkled on Us</h2>
<p>First Peter 1:2 tells us that we were &ldquo;chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In eternity past God the Father chose us (Eph. 1:4), exercising His foreknowledge, and the sanctification of the Spirit followed unto the obedience of faith in Christ. Our believing in Christ results from the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctifying work. We were sanctified, separated, by the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ; sanctification brought us to the sprinkling of the blood shed by the Savior on the cross and separates us unto this divine provision. As a result, we are now the redeemed ones. The sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ is the basic element for us to experience Christ.</p>
<p>In verse 2 Peter does not use the word <em>redemption.</em> He purposely uses the expression, the <em>sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.</em> It would have been too simple merely to use the word <em>redemption.</em> But to speak of the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ is to expound, define, and apply the matter of redemption.</p>
<p>According to the teaching of the New Testament, God&rsquo;s salvation is first composed of the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus. After a person repents and believes, the first thing God applies to him is the &ldquo;sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; God applies the sprinkling of the blood to us because we are sinners. We have no ground to receive anything from God; we have no merit in ourselves. The only ground that we have is the blood shed by the Lord Jesus for us. In order to receive or claim anything, we need the proper ground. The redeeming blood, which is applied to us, is the ground for all the items of God&rsquo;s salvation. It is the only ground on which we can stand to claim all that God intends to give us.</p>
<p>The application of the blood of the Lord Jesus is its sprinkling upon us. We were evil, filthy, and full of transgressions. God&rsquo;s condemnation was upon us, and there was no way for the record of our sins to be annulled. But when the redeeming blood of the Lord Jesus was sprinkled upon us, it solved all these problems. The blood not only covered our sins; it also purged them away. The sprinkling of the blood upon us enables God to continue with many works of grace within us.</p>
<p>In typology the sprinkling of the expiating blood ushered the sprinkled people into the old covenant (Exo. 24:6-8). Likewise, the sprinkling of Christ&rsquo;s redeeming blood brings the sprinkled believers into the blessing of the new covenant, that is, into the full enjoyment of the Triune God (Heb. 9:13-14). This is a striking mark that separates the sprinkled people from the common people, who are without God.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Through His Resurrection from the Dead,<br />
God Having Regenerated Us unto a Living Hope,<br />
unto an Inheritance, Incorruptible,<br />
Undefiled, and Unfading, Kept in the Heavens for Us</h2>
<p>First Peter 1:3-4 goes on to say, &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you.&rdquo; This reveals Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive resurrection. Through His unique and all-inclusive resurrection, both Christ Himself and all His believers were resurrected. In His resurrection not only was Jesus, the Son of Man, begotten to be the firstborn Son of God, but also all His believers were regenerated to be the many sons of God unto a living hope, that is, unto an inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading, kept in the heavens for us.</p>
<p>When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him. Hence, we were resurrected with Him (Eph. 2:6). In His resurrection He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is (John 20:17). This is the basic factor of our regeneration. In keeping with this, the Lord Jesus said in John 12:24 that if a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it bears much fruit. This is a matter of germination through resurrection.</p>
<p>God has regenerated all His chosen people through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. We were not regenerated separately. According to 1 Peter 1:3, we all were regenerated at the time that the Lord Jesus was resurrected. In this light, all the countless believers are as one man in the sight of God. This universal man is the new man (Eph. 2:15). The Head of this new man is Christ, and the Body of this new man is the church. The church as the Body of Christ is not the individual Christ but the corporate Christ, the enlarged Christ.</p>
<p>Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God; regeneration enlivens us with God&rsquo;s life, bringing us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God. Hence, regeneration issues and results in a living hope. Such regeneration is accomplished through the resurrection of Christ from the dead. &ldquo;The resurrection of Christ, bringing in life and the gift of the life-giving Spirit, is that which potentiates the new birth unto a living hope&rdquo; (Alford).</p>
<p>A living hope unto which we have been regenerated is a hope for the future in our sojourning today. This is not a hope of objective things but a hope of life, even eternal life, with all the endless divine blessings. Such a hope should cause us to set our hope perfectly on the coming grace (1 Pet. 1:13).</p>
<p>The living hope, the hope of life, brought to the regenerated believers through regeneration, can be likened to the various expectations for the future brought to parents through the birth of a baby; all such expectations hinge on the life of the newborn child. Likewise, the life that we, the believers, have received through regeneration enables us to have a hope, with numerous aspects, for this age, for the coming age, and for eternity. In this age we have the hope of growing in life, of maturing, of manifesting our gifts, of exercising our functions, of being transformed, of overcoming, of being redeemed in our body, and of entering into glory. In the coming age we have the hope of entering into the kingdom, of reigning with the Lord, and of enjoying the blessings of the eternal life in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. In eternity we have the hope of being in the New Jerusalem, where we will participate fully in the consummated blessings of the eternal life in its ultimate manifestation in eternity. This living hope, the hope of life, hinges on the eternal life, which we received through regeneration. Only the divine life can enable us to grow in the divine life until we grow into the reality of the hope that is brought to us by that life. This is the hope that the life within us will develop until it reaches maturity and consummates in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The hope of life is the enjoyment of eternal life. This enjoyment is not only for the future; it is for us to experience today. The enjoyment of eternal life is the fulfillment of the hope of life. The full enjoyment of eternal life will be in the future, but today we may have a foretaste. Then in the future we will enjoy the full taste. Both the foretaste and the full taste are the fulfillment of the hope of this life.</p>
<p>The expression <em>unto an inheritance</em> in verse 4 is in apposition to <em>unto a living hope</em> in verse 3. The living hope, resulting from regeneration, is our expectation of the coming blessing; the inheritance is the fulfillment of our hope in the coming age and in eternity.</p>
<p>The inheritance in verse 4 comprises the coming salvation of our souls (vv. 5, 9), the grace to be received at the revelation of the Lord (v. 13), the glory to be revealed (5:1), the unfading crown of glory (v. 4), and the eternal glory (v. 10). All these items of our eternal inheritance are related to the divine life, which we received through regeneration and which we are experiencing and enjoying throughout our entire Christian life. &ldquo;This inheritance is the full possession of that, which was promised to Abraham and all believers (Gen. 12:3; see Gal. 3:6 ff.), an inheritance, as much higher than that which fell to the children of Israel in the possession of Canaan, as the sonship of the regenerate, who have already received the promise of the Spirit through faith as a pledge of their inheritance, is higher than the sonship of Israel: compare Gal. 3:18, 29; 1 Cor. 6:9; Eph. 5:5; Heb. 9:15&rdquo; (Wiesinger, quoted by Alford).</p>
<p>In 1 Peter 1:4, Peter uses three words to describe our inheritance: <em>incorruptible, undefiled,</em> and <em>unfading.</em> Our inheritance is incorruptible in substance, indestructible, not decaying; undefiled in purity, unstained; and unfading in beauty and glory, not withering. These are the excelling qualities of our eternal inheritance in life. These qualities should be related to the Divine Trinity: <em>incorruptible</em> relates to the nature of the Father, which is like gold; <em>undefiled,</em> to the condition preserved by the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctifying work; and <em>unfading,</em> to the glorious expression of the Son.</p>
<p>We should not regard the inheritance in verse 4 as only for the future. This inheritance is for us today, tomorrow, and for eternity. From the day that we were regenerated, this inheritance has been our portion. An inheritance is a proper and legal possession. It is not gained by our energy, ability, or deeds. On the contrary, it is granted to us in a way that is legitimate. We do not work for an inheritance; rather, we receive it. On the day that we were regenerated, we were given the right to share an inheritance. This inheritance includes all the blessings related to eternal life.</p>
<p>Our first birth gave us an inheritance. When we were born of our parents, we inherited God&rsquo;s creation. Because creation is our inheritance through birth, we can enjoy the earth, the sunshine, the air, the atmosphere, the rain, and the wind. All these aspects of our earthly inheritance serve to keep us alive. Without such an inheritance, no one could live. In the same principle, through our second birth, regeneration, we have been born into a new inheritance. This inheritance is not on earth; rather, it is kept in the heavens. Although the new inheritance is kept for us in the heavens, we can enjoy it now on earth. Just as electricity is stored in the power plant far away yet is transmitted from the power plant to our homes for our consumption, so also our heavenly, divine, spiritual inheritance is kept in the heavens yet is continually being transmitted into our spirit for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>As reborn ones, we can daily experience a divine transmission. When we call on the Lord Jesus, we may sense that something within us is connected to the heavens. Before we were regenerated, we never had this kind of realization. This transmission is the application and enjoyment of the inheritance kept in the heavens for us.</p>
<p>Once a person has been born again by God with His Spirit, that person is born unto a living hope, and this living hope is the inheritance of all the spiritual and heavenly blessings related to eternal life. Daily we need to take possession of this inheritance and enjoy it. This inheritance is legal, proper, and legitimate, for Christ died to purchase it for us. He paid the price of His precious blood, and we have been sprinkled with this blood. Therefore, every day we may enjoy the riches of the divine life. Daily we may participate in the inheritance that is ours today and for eternity.</p><h2 class="head4">c. His Being Revealed; Whom Having Not Seen, We Love, and in Whom, Not Seeing at Present yet Believing,<br />
We Exult with Unspeakable and Glorified Joy, Obtaining the End of Our Faith,<br />
the Salvation of Our Souls</h2>
<p>First Peter 1:7-9 says, &ldquo;At the revelation of Jesus Christ; whom having not seen, you love; into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.&rdquo; The Lord is with us today (Matt. 28:20) but in a hidden, veiled way. His coming back will be His revelation, when He will be seen openly by all.</p>
<p>Although we have never seen the Lord Jesus, we love Him. At present we cannot see Him, yet we believe in Him. It is a wonder and a mystery that the believers love One whom they have not seen. We love Him whom we have not seen because of believing, that is, because of the faith that has been infused into us through our hearing of the living word (Gal. 3:2).</p>
<p>According to 1 Peter 1:8, the believers &ldquo;exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory.&rdquo; Joy full of glory is joy immersed in glory. We exult with a joy that is immersed in glory. This joy is immersed in the Lord as glory; thus, it is full of the expression of the Lord. This joy is also unspeakable; it is a joy that is beyond our ability to utter. Things that are wonderful are also unspeakable. By believing into the Lord and loving Him, we obtain great joy. The normal condition of a Christian is to &ldquo;exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The salvation in verse 9 is full salvation, the salvation which is in three stages&mdash;the initial stage, the progressing stage, and the completing stage. We are of three parts: spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23; Heb. 4:12). Our spirit was saved through regeneration (John 3:5-6). Our body will be saved, redeemed, through the coming transfiguration (Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:23). Our soul will be saved from sufferings into the full enjoyment of the Lord at His revelation, His coming back. For this we must deny our soul, our soulish life, with all its pleasures in this age, that we may gain it in the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming age (Matt. 10:37-39; 16:24-27; Luke 17:30-33; John 12:25). At the Lord&rsquo;s revelation, through His judgment seat, some believers will enter into the joy of the Lord (Matt. 25:21, 23; 24:45-46) and some will suffer in weeping and gnashing of teeth (25:30; 24:51). To enter into the Lord&rsquo;s joy is the salvation of our souls (Heb. 10:39).</p>
<p>In 1 Peter 1:9 the salvation of our soul is the end of our faith. Although in our spirit we have been saved, in our soul we are being saved day by day. Our salvation has not yet reached its completion, that is, the end of our faith, the salvation of our soul. This means that at the second coming of Christ, our soul will be saved to the uttermost and will be brought into a higher enjoyment of Christ. According to Matthew 25, Christ at His coming back will say to the believers who are faithful slaves, &ldquo;Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (vv. 21, 23). To partake of the Lord&rsquo;s joy with Him in the coming millennial kingdom is the salvation of our soul. Although the unbelievers freely enjoy all the pleasures of the world, we believers cannot. In this sense, our soul is suffering. But when the Lord comes back, our soul will be saved into His joy to enjoy Him to the uttermost in His kingdom. That will be the end of our faith, the consummation of the process of our faith.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Precious Blood of Him as of a Lamb<br />
without Blemish and without Spot Having Redeemed Us from Our Vain Manner of Life</h2>
<p>In 1 Peter 1:18-19, Peter says, &ldquo;Knowing that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were redeemed from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers, but with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.&rdquo; According to these verses, the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, redeemed us from our vain manner of life. This is the redeeming aspect of the blood of Christ. The first aspect of Christ, as the element of Christian experience revealed in 1 Peter 1, is His sprinkling blood, which brings the believers into the blessing of the new covenant. The blood of Christ is also the redeeming blood that redeemed us from our vain manner of life, bringing us out of the vanity of human life.</p>
<p>The vain manner of life is in contrast to the holy manner of life in verse 15. Our old manner of life, a life in lusts (v. 14), had no meaning and no goal; hence, it was vain. But now our goal is to live a holy life that we may express God in His holiness (vv. 15-16). As a general principle, the blood of Christ has redeemed us from sins, transgressions, lawlessness, and all sinful things (Eph. 1:7; Heb. 9:15; Titus 2:14). Here is an exception: Christ&rsquo;s blood has redeemed us from our old, vain manner of life, because the emphasis here is not on sinfulness but on the manner of life. First Peter 1 emphasizes the holy manner of life which God&rsquo;s chosen people should have in their sojourn. Not only is the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification for this; even Christ&rsquo;s redemption is for this&mdash;to separate us from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers. Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we should pass the days of our sojourning in fear (v. 17).</p>
<p>In order to pass the time of our sojourning in fear, we need a deep realization concerning the redemption of Christ. Today many Christians are living in a loose way because their understanding of Christ&rsquo;s redemption is shallow. The blood that redeemed us is an extraordinary kind of blood&mdash;the blood of the God-man, Jesus Christ, the man whose life reached the highest standard. The Lord Jesus is a man mingled with God. Therefore, when this man died on the cross, God also passed through death. No human words are adequate to explain this. Only the blood of Christ was qualified and sufficient to redeem us, to purchase us.</p>
<p>In verse 18 Peter says that we were redeemed &ldquo;not with corruptible things.&rdquo; The blood of Christ is a material substance, yet its effectiveness, function, worth, power, and authority are eternal and incorruptible. The blood of Christ, by which we are sprinkled and thus marked out from common people, is more precious than silver and gold. The highest price has been paid for our redemption that we might be redeemed from a vain manner of life to a holy life (vv. 18, 15). For this we should have a holy fear, a healthy, serious caution before God that, as God&rsquo;s elect, redeemed with such a high price, we would not miss the purpose of this most high redemption of Christ. In verses 18 and 19 we have a comparison between gold or silver and the Lamb. Gold and silver are valuable, but they are lifeless and inorganic. A lamb, however, is living and organic. Through this comparison, Peter indicates that the price paid for us by Christ was related to something of life and to something organic.</p>
<p>Christ is both divine and human. Christ&rsquo;s divine nature is mingled with His human nature. When He died on the cross, He died as a man. Nevertheless, God was involved with this death. Because Christ is both God and man, His person is unique, and His blood also is unique. No other blood can redeem us. Only the blood of Christ is sufficient for this. His blood is unique because His person is unique. Because He is precious, His blood is precious. The Bible even tells us that today the blood of Christ still speaks for us in the heavens (Heb. 12:24).</p>
<p>First Peter 1:19 says, &ldquo;With precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.&rdquo; It is important to understand what Peter means by <em>blemish</em> and <em>spot</em> and to know the difference between them. <em>Blemish</em> is a term often used for impurities, foreign bodies, or elements of mixture found in precious stones and gems. A spot is a scar that comes from a wound. If we have a wound on our hand, eventually that wound may develop into a scar. Such a scar is a spot on our body. God created us pure, but the fall has brought many foreign bodies, blemishes, into us. All these foreign bodies are of the devil, Satan. Furthermore, in our natural life we have been wounded.</p>
<p>We can see from the typology in the Old Testament that the animal sacrifices were to be without blemish and without spot. For instance, suppose a sheep was to be offered as a sin offering. That sheep had to be without blemish, without mixture; it also had to be without spot, without any wound. The sheep offered as a sin offering had to be pure and perfect.</p>
<p>Among all the human beings who have ever lived on earth, there has been only one man&mdash;the Lord Jesus Christ&mdash;who is without mixture or blemish. Furthermore, He is the only man who has not been wounded morally and ethically. We all have received many wounds to our ethical and moral being; we all must admit that we have not been preserved perfect. Our person and character have been wounded in many ways. As fallen human beings, we have many blemishes and wounds.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the only person without mixture and without spot. He does not have any blemishes or wounds. Actually, the expression <em>without blemish and without spot</em> is an Old Testament term used with respect to sacrifices offered to God. Any Jew reading the first Epistle of Peter would realize this. Because Peter was writing to Jewish believers, he used terms that were familiar to them. In other words, this verse indicates that Jesus Christ is the real sacrifice to be our sin offering and trespass offering. Christ is the real Passover lamb.</p>
<p>The lamb sacrificed at the time of the passover had to be without blemish and without spot. Furthermore, this lamb had to be kept for four days in order to be carefully examined. Before the lamb could be sacrificed, it first had to be without spot. This is what the Lord Jesus experienced in Jerusalem during the days before He was crucified. Day by day He was examined by the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the scribes, the elders, and the priests. They did their best to find a fault of some kind in Him. However, according to their law, they could not find fault with Him. Then they handed the Lord Jesus over to the Roman rulers, to Pilate and Herod. But neither could these Roman rulers, according to Roman law, find any fault in Him. For this reason, Pilate declared, &ldquo;I find no fault in Him&rdquo; (John 18:38). Therefore, according to both divine and secular law, the Lamb of God was examined and found to be without mixture and without spot. Only this unique person is without blemish and without spot.</p>
<p>Peter refers to the Old Testament typology, while simultaneously indicating that Christ is the real passover Lamb. He is our sin offering and our trespass offering, the One offered for the propitiation of the sins of God&rsquo;s people. As the Lamb without blemish and without spot, He shed His precious blood to redeem us. We all need to know that we were redeemed from our vain manner of life by the precious blood of Christ.</p>
<p>We need to spend a substantial amount of time alone with the Lord to consider the precious blood of Christ shed for us on the cross. This will give us the desire to have a holy manner of life in fear. We will want to become holy in all our manner of life and to pass the remaining time of our sojourn in fear. If we would live in this way, we need to realize that we were redeemed, purchased, with the high price of Christ&rsquo;s precious blood. This realization will cause us to have a living in a holy manner of life, for we will realize that Christ&rsquo;s precious blood redeemed us from the vain manner of life. No longer will we want to live in a way that is vain. A vain manner of life is not necessarily sinful. Rather, in certain respects it may be quite moral. Nevertheless, it is still vain&mdash;having no goal, aim, or purpose. Anything without a goal or purpose is vanity. Now we should live a life without any vanity. Everything we do and say should have God&rsquo;s goal in view. This kind of life is weighty and full of content. It is a life with purpose, goal, and aim. Let us all spend time to consider Peter&rsquo;s writing concerning the precious blood of Christ so that in a practical way we may become holy in all our manner of life and pass the time of our sojourn in fear.</p><h2 class="head4">e. He Being Foreknown by God<br />
before the Foundation of the World,<br />
Manifested in the Last Times for Our Sake,<br />
Raised from the Dead, and Given Glory by God</h2>
<p>In 1 Peter 1:20, Peter tells us that Christ &ldquo;was foreknown before the foundation of the world but has been manifested in the last of times for your sake.&rdquo; Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be the redeeming Lamb (John 1:29) for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world. This was done according to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and plan; it did not happen accidentally. Hence, in the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain (Rev. 13:8). First Peter 1:2 speaks of the foreknowledge of God the Father, and verse 20 says that Christ was foreknown before the foundation of the world as the redeeming Lamb. In the New Testament the root of such words as <em>foreknowledge, foreknow,</em> and <em>foreknown</em> is <em>know.</em> This root is preceded by the Greek prefix <em>pro,</em> which means &ldquo;before, or beforehand.&rdquo; In New Testament Greek, words such as <em>foreknow, foreknowledge,</em> and <em>foreknown</em> imply more than what we would understand from the English translations. The Greek root for these words includes the meaning of &ldquo;appreciation, approval, and possession.&rdquo; If we approve something, we will appreciate it. Then we will want to take possession of it and own it.</p>
<p>For Christ to be foreknown means that He was foreordained by God. To foreknow is to foreordain, to ordain beforehand. In his expanded translation of the New Testament, Kenneth S. Wuest uses the words <em>foreordained</em> and <em>foreordination.</em> According to this translation, verse 20 says that Christ &ldquo;was foreordained before the foundation of the universe was laid,&rdquo; and verse 2 says that the believers are &ldquo;chosen-out ones, this choice having been determined by the foreordination of God the Father.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s foreknowledge, therefore, means not only that He knew us in eternity past; it also means that He ordained us. We all were ordained by God the Father in eternity past. We were ordained by Him before the foundation of the world. God&rsquo;s foreknowledge includes foreapproval, foreappreciation, foreacknowledgement, and foreordination. Christ was foreknown before the foundation of the world. This means that in eternity past God approved Christ and appreciated Him. Then God ordained Christ to be the anointed One, the One commissioned to fulfill in time all that had been planned by God.</p>
<p>We may say that in eternity past God held a ceremony of ordination. In that ordination ceremony, He first ordained His Son to be the Christ. Then He ordained all of us, the believers in Christ, to be Christians. In an eternal ordination ceremony before the foundation of the world, we all were ordained when Christ was ordained. When He was ordained to be the Christ, we were ordained to be Christ-men. He was ordained to be the Anointed of God, and we were ordained to be the little anointed ones. How marvelous that Christ and we were ordained at the same time in eternity past! Christ was foreknown by God the Father, and we also were foreknown by Him.</p>
<p>It is a marvelous spiritual fact that we and Christ were foreknown and foreordained by God the Father in eternity past. Verse 20 says that Christ was foreknown, foreordained, and verse 2 indicates that we the believers were chosen according to the foreknowledge, the foreordination, of God. Therefore, verse 20 matches verse 2. When Christ was ordained, we were foreknown and chosen. This is possible because there is no time element with God. We should praise God the Father for His selection, approval, and ordination. With God&rsquo;s foreknowledge and foreordination as the basis, Christ came to the earth to be our Redeemer and to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. Furthermore, the Spirit came to us, worked on us, and brought us to repentance and faith in Christ. Because we were foreordained by God, the Spirit came to us and did whatever was necessary to cause us to believe in Christ.</p>
<p>In verse 20 Peter also says that Christ &ldquo;has been manifested in the last of times for your sake.&rdquo; This implies that it was not necessary for Christ to be manifested for the sake of God. Rather, it was for our sake that He was manifested. The incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the constitution of the Spirit of Christ exist eternally in the sight of God, but for our sake it was necessary for Christ to be manifested through incarnation and to pass through human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension so that the Spirit of Christ could be constituted dispensationally (John 7:39). Christ was ordained before the foundation of the world, but &ldquo;in the last of times&rdquo; and for our sake He was manifested and passed through human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Actually, in the eternal sight of God, all this had happened already. Christ had already been ordained to be Christ, and we had already been ordained to be Christians in eternity past. However, it was still necessary for this foreordination to be carried out in time. Therefore, we were born, lived our human life, and committed many sins and offenses. One day we heard the preaching of the gospel, repented, believed, called on the Lord, and thanked Him for all He had done for us. God did everything in eternity past. The only thing needed was for Christ to be manifested in the last of times for our sake.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:21 says that God raised Christ from the dead and gave Him glory. This was to glorify Christ with glory (v. 11). It was the Father&rsquo;s answer to His prayer in John 17:1. This glory actually includes many kinds of glories: the glory of resurrection, the glory of ascension, the glory of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, and the glory of His reign over the nations in the coming kingdom. Satan put Jesus to death, but God raised Him up and gave Him glory.</p>
<p>First Peter 1 reveals various aspects of Christ as the element of Christian experience: His sprinkling blood, which ushers us into the full enjoyment of the Triune God; His all-inclusive resurrection, through which we were regenerated unto a living hope; His unveiling for the salvation of our soul; His precious blood, which has redeemed us from our vain manner of life; and His being foreknown before the foundation of the world, manifested in the New Testament age, raised from the dead, and given glory by God. Day by day we should enjoy all these items of Christ as the element of Christian experience as revealed in 1 Peter 1.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES</h1>
<h1 class="title">(89)</h1>
<h2 class="head3">105. The Living Stone</h2>
<p>1n 1 Peter 2:4-8 Christ is unveiled as the living stone. In the Bible the matter of the stone is a great subject. According to Genesis 2, man was placed in front of the tree of life, which was put in the garden of Eden out of which a river flowed (vv. 8-10). One of the precious materials that issued from the flow of the river was onyx, which is a precious stone (v. 12). The Bible goes on to reveal Christ as a stone in many aspects. He is the foundation stone, the stone in which we trust and on which we rely (Isa. 28:16; 1 Cor. 3:11). He also is the cornerstone (Matt. 21:42; Acts 4:11; Eph. 2:20) that joins the two walls, one wall being the Jewish believers and the other being the Gentile believers. To the unbelieving Jews, He is the stone of stumbling and the rock of offense (Isa. 8:14-15; Rom. 9:32-33; Luke 2:34). To the nations, He is the smiting stone that will smite and break into pieces the aggregate of human government at His coming back (Dan. 2:34-35; Matt. 21:43-44). Yet to us He is the living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious (1 Pet. 2:4).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Rejected by Men but with God Chosen and Precious</h2>
<p>First Peter 2:4 tells us that Christ as a living stone was &ldquo;rejected by men but with God chosen and precious.&rdquo; Although Christ as the living stone was rejected by the leaders of God&rsquo;s people, this stone was chosen by God. God&rsquo;s choosing of Christ as the living stone is of two aspects. First, Christ was chosen by God in eternity past (1:20). That was God&rsquo;s initial choosing of Him. Then God chose Christ the second time in resurrection. Resurrection is strong proof that God has chosen Christ. This second choosing is a confirmation of God&rsquo;s first choosing. Therefore, in resurrection God confirmed the choice He had made concerning Christ in eternity past.</p>
<p>When Christ was on the cross, apparently He was rejected by God. To the Pharisees and to all the others who opposed Him, the crucifixion of Christ was a sign that God had rejected Him. According to Matthew 27:42-43, the chief priests, with the scribes and the elders, said, &ldquo;He is King of Israel; let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe on Him. He trusts in God; let Him rescue Him now if He wants Him, for He said, I am the Son of God.&rdquo; Luke 23:35 says, &ldquo;The rulers also sneered, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!&rdquo; The religious leaders thought that God had rejected Christ. However, on the third day Christ was resurrected, and that resurrection is a sign of God&rsquo;s choosing, a proof that God had chosen Christ to be the stone for His building.</p>
<p>From the time of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, Christ has been held in honor. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;precious&rdquo; in 1 Peter 2:4, the same word that is used in verse 6, also means &ldquo;held in honor.&rdquo; It differs from the Greek word translated &ldquo;precious&rdquo; in 1:19. There the word denotes preciousness in essence; here it indicates preciousness that is recognized and held in honor.</p>
<p>In 2:6, Peter says, quoting Isaiah 28:16, &ldquo;Behold, I lay in Zion a cornerstone, chosen and precious.&rdquo; This statement refers not only to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection but also to His ascension. After God resurrected Christ, He lifted Him up to the heavens. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s ascension is a further sign and confirmation that God had chosen Him.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s choosing of Christ in eternity past was not seen by anyone, not even by the angels. When God chose Christ, nothing had been created, for that choice was made before the foundation of the world. Only God knew that Christ was His chosen One. But this choice has been manifested in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension. Soon after Christ&rsquo;s ascension, Peter realized clearly that Christ is the Messiah chosen by God. This is the reason that Peter said to the religious leaders in Acts 4, &ldquo;Let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified and whom God has raised from the dead, in this name this man stands before you in good health. This is the stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner. And there is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved&rdquo; (vv. 10-12). There is salvation in no other name because God has chosen Christ, and this choice has been manifested in and confirmed by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension.</p>
<p>Along with the other apostles, Peter could testify that he had seen the resurrected Christ. Furthermore, they had all witnessed His ascension. These two acts&mdash;resurrection and ascension&mdash;prove and confirm that Jesus of Nazareth is the One whom God has chosen to be the head of the corner for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>As such a chosen One, Christ is now held in honor. Christ is not only in glory; He is also on the throne at the right hand of God. This means that He is in a position of honor. Because Christ is now in such an honorable position, He is precious and highly valued.</p>
<p>With Christ as the stone for God&rsquo;s building, there is the aspect of rejection and also the aspect of honor. Christ was rejected by the Jewish leaders, for they put Him on the cross. But Christ has been honored by God, for God resurrected and exalted Him. Therefore, the resurrection and exaltation of Christ are strong signs both that God has chosen Him and that He is held in honor by God.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Coming to Him as Living Stones to Be Built Up<br />
as a Spiritual House into a Holy Priesthood,<br />
to Offer Up Spiritual Sacrifices<br />
Acceptable to God through Him</h2>
<p>First Peter 2:5 says, &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; It is through regeneration and transformation that we who were made of clay can be living stones (Rom. 9:21; 2 Cor. 3:18). At regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growing in us transforms us into living stones.</p>
<p>According to John 1:42, Andrew brought his brother Simon Peter to the Lord Jesus. &ldquo;Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).&rdquo; Later, in Caesarea Philippi, the Lord Jesus asked His disciples, &ldquo;But you, who do you say that I am?&rdquo; (Matt. 16:15). Peter took the lead to declare, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16). In His response to Peter, the Lord said, &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (v. 18). Here the name <em>Peter</em> means &ldquo;a stone,&rdquo; which is material for God&rsquo;s building. In his ministry Peter emphasizes the matter of a stone probably because a crucial part of his experience as one of the Lord&rsquo;s disciples was the Lord&rsquo;s changing his name from Simon to Peter.</p>
<p>We come to Christ as living stones to be built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Him. The spiritual house, which is the church (1 Tim. 3:15), is a priesthood, which is a priestly ministry. The totality of the corporate priestly service of the believers is the spiritual house. The holy priesthood, which is a spiritual house built up with the believers as many stones, is the priestly ministry of the believers as many priests to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Him.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Our Coming to Him as Living Stones</h2>
<p>A living stone is one that not only possesses life but also grows in life. This is Christ for God&rsquo;s building. In 1 Peter 1:23 Peter said that we have been regenerated through the living and abiding word of God as the incorruptible seed. In 2:4 Peter changed his metaphor from a seed, which is of the vegetable life (1:23-24), to a stone, which is of the minerals. The seed is for life-planting; the stone is for building (2:5). Peter&rsquo;s thought went on from life-planting to God&rsquo;s building. As life to us, Christ is the seed; for God&rsquo;s building, He is the stone. After receiving Him as the seed of life, we need to grow that we may experience Him as the stone living in us. Thus He will make us also living stones, transformed with His stone nature, that we may be built together with others as a spiritual house upon Him as both the foundation and the cornerstone (Isa. 28:16).</p>
<p>In 1 Peter 2:4-5 Peter speaks of our &ldquo;coming to Him, a living stone,&rdquo; and our being &ldquo;living stones.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;coming&rdquo; can also be translated &ldquo;approaching, drawing near, coming forward.&rdquo; We become living stones by coming to Christ as the living stone.</p>
<p>According to 2:2, we as newborn babes long for the guileless milk of the word; according to verse 4, we need to come to Christ as the living stone. This indicates that we come to the Lord by drinking the milk of the word. The milk of the word is the Lord Himself. Therefore, when we drink the milk, we come to the Lord. The word <em>coming</em> mentioned in verse 4 is equal to drinking, implied in verse 2. Therefore, when we drink the milk, we come to the Lord.</p>
<p>As the all-inclusive One, Christ is both milk and the stone. We need more experience of Christ as the milk and the stone. In the morning we should drink Christ as milk of the Word. Then during the day, the process of transformation should take place within us. In the evening we should come to the church meetings and fellowship with the saints. This is building. Here we see that in the morning Christ is milk, and in the evening He becomes the stone. During the day, the milk does a transforming work within us to produce a stone.</p>
<p>Those who do not experience Christ as milk may like to be scattered or independent. Although some believers visit them and encourage them to come to the meetings, they do not want to attend the meetings. Yet they may begin to have a desire to drink the milk of the word. When they drink the milk, they will long to come to the church meetings.</p>
<p>The Lord is first milk to nourish us. Through the nourishment in the milk of the word, transformation takes place. Then we have the building, where the Lord Himself is the stone. This is the reason that in chapter 2 we first have the milk and then the stone.</p><h2 class="head5">2) To Be Built Up as a Spiritual house<br />
into a Holy Priesthood</h2>
<p>In 1 Peter 2:5 the word <em>spiritual</em> denotes the capacity of the divine life to live and grow; <em>holy</em>, the capacity of the divine nature to separate and sanctify. The house of God subsists mainly by the divine life; hence, it is spiritual. The priesthood subsists mainly by the divine nature; hence, it is holy.</p>
<p>The holy priesthood is the spiritual house. In the New Testament three Greek words are used in relation to the priests: <em>hierosune,</em> referring to the priestly office, as in Hebrews 7:12; <em>hierateia,</em> referring to the priestly service, as in verse 5; and <em>hierateuma,</em> referring to the assembly of priests, a body of priests, a priesthood, as in 1 Peter 2:5 and 9. The coordinated body of priests is the built-up spiritual house. Although Peter did not address his two Epistles to the church or use the term <em>church</em> in this verse in stressing the corporate life of the believers, he did use the terms <em>spiritual house</em> and <em>holy priesthood</em> to indicate the church life. It is not the spiritual life lived in an individualistic way, but the spiritual life lived in a corporate way, that can fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and satisfy His desire. He wants a spiritual house for His dwelling, a priestly body, a priesthood, for His service. Peter&rsquo;s view concerning the believers&rsquo; corporate service in coordination is the same as Paul&rsquo;s in Romans 12. This service issues from the three vital steps in the spiritual life: being born anew (1 Pet. 2:2a), growing in life by being nourished with Christ (v. 2b), and being built up with the believers.</p>
<p>The purpose of our growing is to be built up as a spiritual house, which is the church. God&rsquo;s purpose is that we be built up together as a spiritual house, and this spiritual house is a priesthood, a body of priests built together to offer up spiritual sacrifices to God. This is the service in the church and the church life. This building, this spiritual house, is the Body of Christ. The priests are the members of the Body of Christ, and the priesthood is the Body. The Body with many priests coordinated together offers up spiritual sacrifices to God.</p>
<p>The New Testament believers are priests of God not individually but corporately; they are a body of priests, a priesthood. The body of priests in coordination is the built-up spiritual house. God wants a spiritual house for His dwelling, a priestly body, for His service. We all need the corporate service in the spiritual house in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and satisfy God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>Without being built up into a spiritual house, the living stones can do nothing and thus are useless. The stones need to be built up into a house that will be useful to God. This usefulness of the stones is the priestly service, and this house is the priesthood. There is the need of a priestly body, a priestly group, to offer spiritual sacrifices. If we are not built up as such a priestly body, we are not qualified to offer anything to God. Therefore, if we are not built up, we are not qualified to serve. For the service, we need the Body.</p>
<p>We all must realize that we cannot serve God by ourselves individually. We must serve in coordination with others. One stone can never be a house; it must be built up together with other stones to form a building. It is impossible for an individual Christian to constitute the priesthood. This means, strictly speaking, that if there is no building, there is no real service to God. It is only when we are built together that proper service can be rendered to God. Real service to God is a matter of the building.</p>
<p>Romans 12 speaks clearly of the members of the Body of Christ functioning together in all kinds of ministries and services. The service of the Lord&rsquo;s people must be in the Body, the building, the church. In principle, this is the reason that the book of Leviticus follows Exodus. Exodus is a record of building, and Leviticus is a book of service. Service always follows building. If there were no tabernacle, there could be no priests to serve. As Christians, we are individual persons, but we cannot be individualistic Christians. We cannot serve the Lord independent of others. Each individual priest must be coordinated with all the other priests. It is a dreadful thing to attempt to serve the Lord apart from the proper church life, apart from being built up with others. We must be built together as the priesthood to serve God in the building, the church, in a coordinated way.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:5 says that we, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house. However, if we all are clay, how can we be built up? In order to be built up as a spiritual house, we need to become stones, and in order to become living stones, we need to come to Christ as the living stone by drinking the guileless milk of the word.</p>
<p>If we long for the milk of the word, this milk will be like a current of living water flowing within us. As we stay in this flow, the current will carry away our natural substance and replace it with Christ as heavenly, divine minerals. Gradually, over a period of time, we will be transformed; that is, we will become precious stones. If we would be transformed, every day we need to come to the Lord as milk.</p>
<p>Feeding on Christ by taking in the nourishing milk in the word of God is not only for growing in life but also for building up. Growing is for building up. Although the nourishing milk of the word is for the soul through the mind, it eventually nourishes our spirit, making us not soulish but spiritual, suitable for being built up as a spiritual house of God.</p>
<p>Our mutual dependence on one another as the members of the Body comes through a transforming work. When we are transformed into the image of Christ and express Him fully, our individualism will disappear automatically. Only then will we be in the coordination and relatedness of the Body.</p>
<p>The spiritual house into which we are being built is God&rsquo;s building. Eventually, this building will consummate in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem there will not be any clay, for all the clay will have been transformed into precious stones. This means that the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones. We are becoming the precious stones that will be built up into the New Jerusalem. The building work is now going on as we daily, even hourly, come to Christ as milk and drink Him. Then we will have the flow, the current, that transforms us from clay into stone for God&rsquo;s building.</p><h2 class="head5">3) To Offer Up Spiritual Sacrifices Acceptable to God through Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>The spiritual sacrifices that the believers offer in the New Testament age according to God&rsquo;s economy are: (1) Christ as the reality of all the sacrifices of the Old Testament types, such as the burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering (Lev. 1&mdash;5); (2) the sinners saved by our gospel preaching, offered as members of Christ (Rom. 15:16); and (3) our body, our praises, and the things that we do for God (12:1; Heb. 13:15-16; Phil. 4:18).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Chosen Stone Laid in Zion,<br />
the Precious Cornerstone, on Whom We Believe and Shall by No Means Be Put to Shame</h2>
<p>First Peter 2:6 says, &ldquo;Behold, I lay in Zion a cornerstone, chosen and precious; and he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ is the chosen stone laid in Zion, the precious cornerstone, and that he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame. The expression <em>on Him</em> implies that Christ is a base, a standing. This indicates that Christ as the cornerstone is a base upon which we put our faith. We believe on this cornerstone as a strong base; hence, we will never be put to shame. Christ is trustworthy, stable, and steadfast. We can put our trust in Him and be assured that we will never be put to shame.</p>
<p>Christ as the cornerstone is for the building up of the church in the New Testament age. In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy Christ as the cornerstone, in His saving us (Acts 4:11-12), first makes us living stones for the building up of God&rsquo;s spiritual house (Matt. 16:16-18; John 1:42; 1 Pet. 2:2-6), and then, in the process of His transforming us (Rom. 12:2a; 2 Cor. 3:18), builds us up into a dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:19-22), that He may carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy for God&rsquo;s good pleasure (1:9; 3:9-11).</p>
<p>As the all-inclusive stone, Christ is the centrality of God&rsquo;s move for the building up of His eternal habitation (Matt. 21:42, 44; Zech. 3:9, cf. Rev. 5:5-6; Acts 4:10-12; Isa. 28:16; Eph. 2:19-22; 1 Pet. 2:4-8; Dan. 2:34-35; Zech. 4:7; Rev. 21:11, cf. 4:3). Everything Christ is, everything He has done, and everything He is doing is due to the fact that He is the cornerstone. It is by His being the cornerstone that He could die for us, that we could be crucified with Him, made alive with Him, resurrected with Him, and seated with Him in the heavenlies, and that He could save us, transform us into precious stones, and build us together to be God&rsquo;s habitation, God&rsquo;s unique temple in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. To Us Who Believe Being the Preciousness<br />
but to the Unbelieving a Stone Which the Builders Rejected and Which Became the Head of the Corner<br />
and a Stone of Stumbling and a Rock of Offense</h2>
<p>In 1 Peter 2:7-8, Peter says, &ldquo;To you therefore who believe is the preciousness; but to the unbelieving, &lsquo;The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense&rsquo;; who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.&rdquo; In verse 7 the Greek word translated &ldquo;preciousness&rdquo; is a word kindred to <em>precious</em> in verses 4 and 6. The Christ chosen by God as a stone, even a cornerstone that is precious to God, is the preciousness to His believers, that is, the quality of being exceedingly precious. But to the unbelieving, He is a stone which the builders, the Jewish leaders, rejected (Acts 4:11) and which became the head of the corner, the cornerstone, and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense. Many Jews, including famous men, fell on Him as the stone of stumbling.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;builders&rdquo; in 1 Peter 2:7 were the Jewish leaders in Judaism, who were supposed to build the house of God. They rejected Christ to the uttermost. The reliable Christ (1 Pet. 2:6), being rejected, became a stumbling stone, on which the rejecting Judaizers stumbled (Matt. 21:44a).</p>
<p>In the Bible Christ is revealed as at least nine kinds of stones. He is the eternal rock (Isa. 26:4; Matt. 16:18), the foundation stone (Isa. 28:16; 1 Cor. 3:11), the living stone (1 Pet. 2:4), the cornerstone (v. 6; Acts 4:11; Eph. 2:20; Psa. 118:22; Isa. 28:16), the precious stone (v. 16; 1 Pet. 2:4, 6-7), the topstone (Zech. 4:7), the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4), the crushing stone (Dan. 2:34-35; Matt. 21:44b), and the stone of stumbling (Isa. 8:14; Rom. 9:33).</p>
<p>As the cleft rock, Christ is not for building but for flowing out the living water. He is the rock that was smitten and cleft on the cross to flow out His eternal life as our living water (John 19:34). In contrast, Christ is the foundation stone, the cornerstone, and the topstone, not to be our supply but to be the material for God&rsquo;s building. One day Christ will be placed on God&rsquo;s building as the topstone. According to Zechariah 4:7, at that time all the people of God will shout, &ldquo;Grace, grace to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Daniel 2:34-35 Christ is revealed as the crushing stone, who comes to destroy the totality of human government, represented by the human image (vv. 31-33). In Matthew 21:44, concerning this stone the Lord Jesus told the people, &ldquo;On whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff.&rdquo; Christ is the crushing stone, not toward the believers but toward the unbelieving Gentiles. Christ is also revealed as a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense toward the unbelieving Jews (Isa. 8:14; Rom. 9:33; 1 Pet. 2:8).</p>
<p>There are three basic categories of people on the earth&mdash;the Jews, the Gentiles, and the believers in Christ. Christ is related to each of these categories of people as different kinds of stones. To the believers, Christ is the eternal rock, the foundation stone, the living stone, the cornerstone, the precious stone, the topstone, and the cleft rock. These are items of Christ as a stone in a positive sense. In a negative sense, Christ will be a crushing stone to the unbelieving Gentiles and a stone of stumbling to the unbelieving Jews. Thus, Christ is related to every kind of person on the earth. No one can say that Christ has nothing to do with him or her.</p>
<p>In verse 8 Peter speaks of those &ldquo;who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.&rdquo; Concerning the relative pronoun <em>who,</em> there is not a clear antecedent expressed. However, we may say that the antecedent is implied. Peter&rsquo;s thought may be that those &ldquo;who stumble at the word&rdquo; may refer to anyone or to everyone who stumbles. If we stumble at the word, then this &ldquo;who&rdquo; includes us. It refers to anyone throughout the generations who stumbles at the word.</p>
<p>What is the word at which people may stumble? It is the word quoted by Peter in verses 6 through 8, the word regarding a chosen stone, a cornerstone held in honor, being laid in Zion. It also refers to the word concerning the stone rejected by the builders that becomes the head of the corner (v. 7). Furthermore, it includes the word in verse 8 about this stone being a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense. This is the word at which people may stumble.</p>
<p>The Jews at the time of the Lord Jesus and the apostles would not believe in such a word. Their attitude was that it was impossible for Jesus of Nazareth ever to be the head of the corner. Instead of believing in this word, the Jewish leaders and the rabbis argued against it. Whoever does not believe this word will stumble at it.</p>
<p>We should not think that it is impossible for Christians to stumble at the word. There are many Christians who have stumbled at the word. They do not believe that the Lord Jesus can be so strict, straight, or narrow. Sometimes we may have spoken with certain believers regarding the matter of Christ being both the building stone and the stumbling stone. Yet they have replied that because the Lord Jesus is merciful and has a broad heart, He would never be a stone of stumbling or a rock of offense. However, if we are too broad, we will not believe, on the one hand, that Christ is the building stone and, on the other hand, that He is also the stumbling stone. Many Christians have stumbled at this strict word. The Jewish leaders were not the only ones who have stumbled at it.</p>
<p>We need to see that Christ could purposely be a rock of offense. We also need to be careful concerning this and ask ourselves if we believe this word. If we do not believe it, then we are stumbled by it. Then automatically the Lord will become a stumbling block to us. We stumble at such a word because, in our opinion, it is too narrow and strict.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">106. Our Substitute,<br />
Our Shepherd and Overseer,<br />
and Our Model</h2>
<p>In 1 Peter 2:21-25 we see that Christ is our Substitute, our Shepherd and Overseer, and our model.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Our Substitute</h2>
<p>First Peter 2:22-24 presents Christ as our Substitute.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Committing No Sin nor Guile Being Found<br />
in His Mouth; Being Reviled, Not Reviling in Return; Suffering, Not Threatening but Committing All<br />
to Him Who Judges Righteously</h2>
<p>Verses 22 and 23 tell us that the Lord Jesus &ldquo;committed no sin, nor was guile found in His mouth; who being reviled did not revile in return; suffering, He did not threaten but kept committing all to Him who judges righteously.&rdquo; It is indeed remarkable that no guile was found in the Lord&rsquo;s mouth. Our lips and tongue cause much trouble. Many negative things have resulted from the improper use of our tongue and lips. It is not an easy matter to have no guile in our mouth. Consider how many mistakes we make in one day because of the things we say. Because we in ourselves cannot be without guile, Peter specifically says that no guile was found in the Lord&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was suffering silently like a sheep before its shearers. When He was reviled, He did not revile in return. Today we need to learn of this model. If people revile us, we should not have any thought of avenging by reviling them in return.</p>
<p>The word <em>all,</em> inserted in verse 23, refers to all the sufferings of the Lord. The Lord kept committing all His insults and injuries to Him who judges righteously in His government, the righteous God, to whom He submitted Himself. This indicates that the Lord recognized God&rsquo;s government while He was living a human life on earth.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was under God&rsquo;s government. Because the Lord lived under God&rsquo;s government, He committed all His sufferings to God. Here Peter does not speak of God as the faithful One, but as the One who judges righteously. The reason for this is that judging righteously is a matter of God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>When Christ was suffering under men&rsquo;s persecution, He always kept committing all things to God who judges righteously, that is, to the righteous God. God the Father is the One who always judges righteously. This means that He governs in a righteous way. Christ put His trust in this righteous One. He lived a life absolutely under God&rsquo;s government, and He committed everything related to Him to God&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Bearing Up Our Sins in His Body on the Tree That We,<br />
Having Died to Sins, Might Live to Righteousness;<br />
by Whose Bruise We Were Healed</h2>
<p>In verse 24 Peter goes on to tell us that Christ Himself &ldquo;bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose bruise you were healed.&rdquo; This verse points out that when the Lord offered up Himself as a sacrifice (Heb. 7:27) on the cross, He bore up our sins in His body on the cross, the true altar for propitiation.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:24 speaks of Christ as our Savior, our Redeemer. As our Savior, Christ &ldquo;bore up our sins in His body on the tree.&rdquo; The &ldquo;tree&rdquo; here is the cross made of wood, a Roman instrument of capital punishment used for the execution of malefactors, as prophesied in the Old Testament (Deut. 21:23; Gal. 3:13). First Peter 2:24 indicates that, as fallen human beings, we were dead and full of sins, but Christ put our sins upon Himself and bore them on the tree, the cross, where He suffered God&rsquo;s righteous judgment for all our sins.</p>
<p>According to Isaiah 53:6, when Christ was on the cross, God took all our sins and put them on this Lamb of God. Hebrews 9:28 says that Christ has been &ldquo;offered once to bear the sins of many.&rdquo; Christ died once to bear our sins, and He suffered the judgment for us on the cross (Isa. 53:5, 11). Sins in 1 Peter 2:24, as in Hebrews 9:28, refer to sins we commit in our outward conduct, whereas sin in John 1:29 refers to the sin that is in our nature by birth. Christ died for our sins, bearing our sins on the cross, that we might be forgiven by God.</p>
<p>Through His death on the cross, we have died to sins. This means that through Christ&rsquo;s death we were crucified with Him to sins so that we might live to righteousness, that is, live to God righteously. Literally, the expression <em>having died to sins</em> means &ldquo;being away from; hence, having died to.&rdquo; In the death of Christ we have died to sins (Rom. 6:8, 10-11, 18). We have died to sins so that we might live to righteousness. This living to righteousness is in the resurrection of Christ (Eph. 2:6; John 14:19; 2 Tim. 2:11). Righteousness is a matter of God&rsquo;s government. We were saved so that we might live rightly under the government of God, that is, in a way that matches the righteous requirements of His government.</p>
<p>When Christ bore up our sins on the cross and died, that death accomplished many things. The death of Christ terminated us, and this termination can keep us away from sin. The best way for people to be kept from sins or from sin is for them to be put to death. No matter how many sins a person may commit, once he has died, death separates him from sins. Peter speaks of being away from sins; Paul speaks of the one who has died being free from sin (Rom. 6:1-11). Through Christ&rsquo;s death we can be kept away from sins so that we may live to righteousness. Apparently, being kept away from sin terminates us; actually, it enlivens us so that we may live to righteousness.</p>
<p>According to 1 Peter 2:24, we have been healed by Christ&rsquo;s bruise. The &ldquo;bruise&rdquo; in this verse is a suffering that resulted in death. According to Genesis 3:15, the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent, and the serpent will bruise the heel of the woman&rsquo;s seed. The bruising in Genesis 3:15 is related to the bruise in 1 Peter 2:24.</p>
<p>As fallen human beings, we were dead and full of sin (Eph. 2:1). But Christ put our sins upon Himself and bore them on the tree, the cross, where He suffered God&rsquo;s righteous judgment for all our sins. Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross was a bruise, and that bruise, that death, has healed our death. Now we have been made alive (v. 5). On the one hand, Christ&rsquo;s bruise that heals us keeps us away from sins through His death; on the other hand, this healing enlivens us so that we may live to righteousness.</p>
<p>According to our dead, fallen nature, our intention is toward sins. But now that Christ died to heal our death and to make us alive, we have a different intention. Because of the life of Christ within us, we live always with the intention toward righteousness, the inclination toward righteousness. This is our Savior, the One who died on the cross to terminate us and to heal our death wound.</p>
<p>The subjective aspect of the cross continues in our experience today by the Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is working within us continually to carry out the subjective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s cross in our being. Daily we are undergoing the inward working of the cross of Christ, and daily we are being made alive so that we may live to righteousness. Therefore, it is not difficult to overcome sins, because through Christ&rsquo;s death we are being kept away from sins. His death has drawn a separating line between us and sins. Being kept away from sins, now we are alive. There is no need for us to strive or to try to energize ourselves. We simply live, and this living always has an inclination toward righteousness. This is the experience of our Savior saving us daily. We should not have only the objective cross but the subjective cross as well. The objective cross needs to become subjective to us in our experience. This depends upon the working of the life-giving Spirit within us. When we call on the name of the Lord and have fellowship with Him, the life-giving Spirit operates within us. Spontaneously we experience the subjective working of the cross to make a separation between us and sins so that we automatically live to righteousness.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Our Shepherd and Overseer</h2>
<p>First Peter 2:25 says, &ldquo;You were like sheep being led astray, but you have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your soul.&rdquo; This verse reveals Christ as the Shepherd and Overseer of our soul, our inner being. Christ was our Redeemer in His death on the tree (v. 24). Now He is our soul&rsquo;s Shepherd and Overseer in the resurrection life within us. As such, He is able to guide us and supply us with life that we may follow in His steps according to the model of His suffering (v. 21).</p>
<p>As the Shepherd and Overseer, Christ takes care of us from within our spirit, not from the heavens. Today our Shepherd and Overseer is in our spirit, indwelling us as the life-giving Spirit. His shepherding and overseeing begin from our spirit and then spread to every part of our soul. This means that from our spirit Christ reaches the parts of our soul&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will&mdash;and takes care of all our problems, needs, and wounds.</p>
<h2 class="head5">1) Our Shepherd</h2>
<p>Our soul is our inner being, our real person. Our Lord, as the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls, shepherds us by caring for the welfare of our inner being and by exercising His oversight over the condition of our real person. How good it is that we have Christ as our Shepherd! All the believers, from the youngest to the most mature, sense that they need such a Shepherd to take care of them. We all need the Lord to shepherd us. No one, including the angels, can shepherd us as adequately as He can. Our Shepherd is Jehovah the Savior; He is our good Shepherd (John 10:14). Christ is the only One who has no need for shepherding. He is the unique Shepherd, and He is shepherding us all. How good, sweet, and satisfying it is to have such a Shepherd who cares for our soul!</p>
<p>Our problem was that we were like sheep being led astray, but now we have returned, turned back, to the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls. In 1 Peter 2:25 Peter is not using <em>soul</em> as a synonym of <em>spirit.</em> A shepherd takes care of the physical needs of his flock, and Christ our Shepherd takes care of the needs of our soul. Here Peter speaks of Christ not as the Shepherd of our body but as the Shepherd of our soul, our inner being. We all have a spirit, and the spirit is our inward organ. Yet our being is a soul. Therefore, Christ shepherds us mainly by taking care of our soul. This means that He takes care of our mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>We may think that our problems are with the body. No doubt, the body does give us many problems. Nevertheless, our real problem is in our soul. Our mind, emotion, and will all have problems. Unbelievers are wanderers in the soul, and they do not have a shepherd to take care of them. But our situation is different in that we have a Shepherd who takes care of our soul. Not only do we have the Lord&rsquo;s life within us, but we also have Him as our Shepherd. He is now shepherding us in our soul. First Peter was written to Jewish believers who were suffering much persecution. Apparently, persecution is related to our body outwardly; actually, persecution is aimed at the soul. Because it is our soul that suffers, it is our soul that needs the Lord&rsquo;s shepherding. It is not our body that needs this kind of care, nor is it mainly our spirit. It is our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;that needs the Lord as the Shepherd.</p>
<p>In our experience sometimes we do not know what to think about. We do not know where to direct our thoughts. This is an indication that our mind needs the Lord Jesus as the Shepherd. As a result of His shepherding, our mind is directed and set in the right way.</p>
<p>Our emotion, being complicated, is easily upset. Therefore, we need the Lord Jesus to shepherd us in our emotion. His shepherding comforts our emotion.</p>
<p>Our will also needs the Lord&rsquo;s shepherding. As human beings, we often find it difficult to make the right decision. Sometimes the most difficult thing to do is to make a decision. Unbelievers have no one to lead them and guide them in making decisions, but we have a Shepherd to lead us and guide us. The Lord&rsquo;s leading and guiding is primarily related to our will. As the living Shepherd, the Lord continually directs our will. The Lord is truly the Shepherd of our soul. He directs our mind, comforts our emotion, and leads and guides our will.</p>
<p>According to our experience, there is a difference between leading and guiding. Leading, like a road map, points us to a destination, whereas guidance directs us to the exact place where we want to go. In the Bible some verses speak of the Lord&rsquo;s leading, and others, of His guiding. The Lord leads His people to the holy land (Amos 2:10; Gen. 15:18-21), but once He has led them there, He guides them to Mount Zion (Exo. 15:13, 17; Isa. 8:18; 18:7). As our Shepherd, the Lord leads us first and then guides us. He leads us to the right place, and He guides us to the exact spot. This is Christ, our Shepherd.</p>
<p>In order to be our living Shepherd, Christ needs to dwell within us. If Christ today were not the life-giving Spirit in us, if He were only the exalted Lord in an objective way in the third heaven, how could He be our Shepherd? For Christ to be our Shepherd, He must be with us, even in us.</p>
<p>Many times Christ goes along with us in order to turn us back. Consider how the Lord was the Shepherd to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus. These disciples were going in one direction, but the Lord went with them in order to turn them to go in another direction. Luke 24:15 says, &ldquo;While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.&rdquo; Then He asked them what they were talking about. In a sense, these disciples rebuked the Lord when one of them said, &ldquo;Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days?&rdquo; (v. 18). Then the Lord asked, &ldquo;What things?&rdquo; (v. 19). After walking a while together, they constrained the Lord to stay with them (v. 29). Then as He took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, &ldquo;their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him&rdquo; (vv. 30-31). This is an example of the Lord&rsquo;s shepherding.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Lord shepherds us in the same way that He shepherded the disciples on the road to Emmaus. We also may speak to Him in a nonsensical way or ask Him nonsensical questions. We may even rebuke Him, and He may pretend not to know what we are talking about. Many of us can testify of having the Lord Jesus shepherd us in this way. As the life-giving Spirit dwelling within us, He is the Shepherd to us in our experience.</p><h2 class="head5">2) Our Overseer</h2>
<p>According to the word in 1 Peter 2:25, Christ is also the Overseer of our souls. The Greek word for <em>overseer</em> means &ldquo;one who oversees a particular condition or situation.&rdquo; As the Overseer of our soul, our being, He is looking after us and watching over us. He always follows us, watching over us. No human being, whether he or she be our parent or spouse, can accompany us and oversee us constantly. Only the Lord Jesus can oversee our soul all the time. How blessed we are to have such an overseer!</p>
<p>According to our experience, the Lord as the Overseer is the One who cares for us. For Him to oversee us means that He takes care of us. As the Overseer, the Lord does not govern us or rule over us; rather, He cares for us as a mother oversees her child with the purpose of caring for the child and meeting his every need.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s shepherding of His flock includes His caring for their outward things and also their inner being, their soul. He takes care of the things concerning their soul by overseeing their soul. Christ indwells us to be our life and everything, but He is also overseeing, observing, the condition and situation of our inner being.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Our Model</h2>
<p>In verses 19 and 20, Peter says, &ldquo;This is grace, if anyone, because of a consciousness of God, bears sorrows by suffering unjustly. For what glory is it if, while sinning and being buffeted, you endure? But if, while doing good and suffering, you endure, this is grace with God.&rdquo; Based upon what he says in verses 19 and 20, Peter goes on to say in verse 21, &ldquo;For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model so that you may follow in His steps.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s living on earth was a model of this grace. We were called to follow Him in His steps, taking Him as the model of our Christian life.</p>
<p>Verse 21 opens with the words, &ldquo;For to this you were called.&rdquo; The word <em>this</em> in verse 21 refers to the unjust sufferings, the suffering for doing good, mentioned in verses 19 and 20. This means that we were called to suffer unjustly. We would be happy to hear that we have been called to the kingdom and to God&rsquo;s glory. These are marvelous things. But probably very few of us, whether young or old, have realized from verse 21 that we have been called to suffer unjust treatment.</p>
<p>Verse 21 clearly says that we have been called to suffer unjustly because Christ suffered on our behalf and left us a model so that we may follow in His steps. Literally, the Greek word rendered &ldquo;model&rdquo; means &ldquo;a writing copy, an underwriting (used by students to trace letters and thereby learn to draw them).&rdquo; The Lord has set His suffering life before us so that we can copy it by tracing and following His steps. This does not refer to a mere imitation of Him and His life but to a reproduction of Him that comes from enjoying Him as grace in our sufferings so that He Himself as the indwelling Spirit, with all the riches of His life, reproduces Himself in us. We become the reproduction of the original writing copy, not a mere imitation of Him produced by taking Him as our outward model.</p>
<p>As we read 2:18-25, we see that Peter was very rich in the experience of Christ. In this portion he speaks of grace, the model, the Substitute, the Shepherd, and the Overseer. Christ is the life within us, and He is also the model for us to follow. If we live by Christ as our inward life, that is, by the indwelling Christ Himself, we will become a reproduction of Christ. At the same time, we will experience Him as the Substitute saving us, as the Shepherd leading and guiding us, and as the Overseer caring for us. May we all practice to enjoy Christ according to what is revealed in these verses. May we all enjoy Him as grace, as the model, and as the wonderful Savior, Shepherd, and Overseer.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head5">1) Having Suffered Once for Our Sins,<br />
the Righteous on Behalf of the Unrighteous,<br />
That He Might Bring Us to God</h2>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God.&rdquo; Christ is the righteous One, yet He died for our sins, the sins of the unrighteous. His death removed all the barriers, particularly the barriers of our sins and unrighteousness. Because His death has removed all barriers, we have a way to reach God. Christ died in order to bring us to God.</p>
<p>It is true that Christ died on the cross for our sins that we might be forgiven and redeemed. But here Peter says that Christ died for the purpose of bringing His believers to God. He not only brought us to God but also into God.</p>
<p><em>Sins</em> in verse 18 and in 2:24, 1 Corinthians 15:3, and Hebrews 9:28 refers to the sins we commit in our outward conduct; whereas <em>sin</em> in 2 Corinthians 5:21 and Hebrews 9:26 refers to sin that is in our nature by birth. Christ died for our sins, bearing up our sins on the cross, that we might be forgiven of our sins by God. But He was made sin and took away the sin of the world so that the problem of our sin might be solved. Peter did not deal first with sin in our nature but with sins in our conduct, in our manner of life (1 Pet. 3:16). The emphasis of 1 Peter is that Christ&rsquo;s death redeemed us from our inherited vain manner of life (1:18-19).</p>
<p>The fact that Christ, the righteous One, died &ldquo;on behalf of the unrighteous&rdquo; indicates that Christ&rsquo;s death was for redemption, not for martyrdom. On the cross He was our Substitute and bore our sins; He, the righteous One, was judged on behalf of us, the unrighteous, by the righteous God according to His righteousness, that He might remove the barrier of our sins and bring us to God. This was to redeem us from our sins back to God, from our unrighteous manner of life back to the righteous God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Being Put to Death in the Flesh,<br />
but Made Alive in the Spirit</h2>
<p>First Peter 3:18 goes on to tell us that Christ was &ldquo;on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit in which He was made alive is not the Holy Spirit but the Spirit as the essence of Christ&rsquo;s divinity (Rom. 1:4; cf. John 4:24a). The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh&mdash;which He received through His incarnation (1:14)&mdash;not in His Spirit as His divinity. His Spirit as His divinity did not die at the cross when His flesh died; rather, His Spirit as His divinity was made alive, enlivened, with new power of life, so that in this empowered Spirit as His divinity, He made a proclamation to the fallen angels after His death in the flesh and before His resurrection.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Christ was put to death in the flesh; that is, He was crucified on the cross in the flesh. On the other hand, Christ was made alive in the Spirit. Man put Him to death in the flesh, but God made Him alive in the Spirit. While Christ was being crucified on the cross, the Roman soldiers were putting Him to death in His flesh, and the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;was making Him alive, strengthening Him, and empowering Him.</p>
<p>In eternity the Lord was the only begotten Son of God. In time He became flesh to be a man, but He was not yet the firstborn Son of God. Romans 1:3-4 reveals when He became the firstborn Son of God: &ldquo;Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; According to the flesh, He is the seed of David, a man; according to the Spirit of holiness, He is the Son of God. He was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>First Peter 3:18 also shows when and how the designation was done: &ldquo;Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit.&rdquo; This verse tells us that after He died in the flesh, Christ was still active in the Spirit. In John 12:24 the Lord said that He was the grain of wheat which bears much fruit by falling into the ground and dying. On the one hand, He was dying on the cross in the flesh. On the other hand, He was growing in the Spirit. Verse 23 indicates that this was Christ&rsquo;s glorification. When the grain is dying, its life element grows. When a grain of wheat falls into the ground, its outer shell dies and decays, but its life within is active. The grain, on the one hand, dies and, on the other hand, lives. When the grain dies, this death gives the life within an opportunity to operate to bring forth tender sprouts. This is resurrection.</p>
<p>When the Lord was buried in the tomb, it was His flesh, His humanity, that died. However, His divinity, the Spirit of holiness, had a great opportunity to work. The Spirit of holiness resurrected the humanity of Christ and, at the same time, uplifted the humanity of Jesus into divinity. It was at that moment that God said, &ldquo;You are My Son; this day have I begotten You&rdquo; (Acts 13:33). <em>This day</em> refers to the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. Hence, it was at the time that the Spirit of holiness uplifted the humanity of Christ and resurrected His flesh that Christ became the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>First Peter 3:18 shows that in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, His divine part was made alive to impart divinity into His humanity, thus making His humanity divine. Hence, God begot Christ in His resurrection. That begetting equals our regenerating. Christ was begotten, and we were regenerated in the same resurrection at the same time (1:3). This resurrection was a universal birth, a great delivery. In the resurrection of Christ there was a divine birth, a divine delivery, in which all believers were born together with Christ as their firstborn Brother, the firstborn Son of God.</p><h2 class="head5">3) Going to the Spirits in Prison<br />
to Proclaim to Those Once Disobedient</h2>
<p>After His death in the flesh, Christ in the empowered Spirit went to the spirits, rebellious angels, in prison to proclaim God&rsquo;s victory over their leader Satan. This prison refers to Tartarus, the deep and gloomy pits (2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 6), where the fallen angels are kept. The Lord&rsquo;s going here indicates and proves that Christ, after dying in His flesh, was still active in this Spirit. Christ&rsquo;s proclaiming to the spirits in prison was not to preach the good news but to proclaim the victory achieved by God, that is, that through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross God destroyed Satan and his power of darkness (Heb. 2:14; Col. 2:15).</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries great teachers of different schools have had varying interpretations concerning <em>the spirits in prison.</em> The most acceptable according to the Scriptures is as follows: the spirits here refer not to the disembodied spirits of dead human beings held in Hades but to the angels (angels are spirits&mdash;Heb. 1:14) who fell through disobedience at Noah&rsquo;s time (1 Pet. 3:20) and are imprisoned in pits of gloom, awaiting the judgment of the great day (2 Pet. 2:4-5; Jude 6). After His death in the flesh, Christ in His living Spirit as His divinity went (probably to the abyss&mdash;Rom. 10:7) to these rebellious angels to proclaim, perhaps, God&rsquo;s victory, accomplished through His incarnation in Christ and Christ&rsquo;s death in the flesh, over Satan&rsquo;s scheme to derange the divine plan.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Through His Resurrection<br />
Our Having Been Saved by the Water of Baptism</h2>
<p>First Peter 3:20-21 says, &ldquo;In the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; entering into which, a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water. Which water, as the antitype, also now saves you, that is, baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; These verses tell us that through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection we have been saved by the water of baptism.</p>
<p>In Romans 6:4-5 Paul says, &ldquo;We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life. For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.&rdquo; A proper baptism causes spiritual growth within the baptized. This is because when we baptize people, we exercise our faith to apply Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. Yet it is erroneous to teach baptismal regeneration. Strictly speaking, we are regenerated not by the water used in baptism, which in itself is ineffective, but by what it signifies&mdash;the living Christ with His death and resurrection, both of which are applied to us through the Spirit. Baptism is only a figure; its reality is Christ in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, who applies to us all that Christ passed through in His crucifixion and resurrection, making these things real in our daily life. Baptism testifies that we have been baptized into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19) and have been organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life. In this sense, we have been saved through His resurrection by the water of baptism.</p>
<p>In 1 Peter 3:20 Peter says that in the ark prepared by Noah eight souls &ldquo;were brought safely through by water.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;brought&rdquo; means &ldquo;arrive safe into a place of security through difficulty or danger,&rdquo; as Acts 27:44 (Darby). The Greek words rendered &ldquo;by water&rdquo; literally mean &ldquo;through water.&rdquo; Water was the medium through which the saving was accomplished.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the waters of the flood at the time of Noah and the waters of the Red Sea both typify baptism. The ark saved Noah and his family from God&rsquo;s judgment, from the punishment of God&rsquo;s condemnation that came by the flood. But the water saved them and separated them from that corrupted age and brought them into a new age to begin a new life on a new earth.</p>
<p>In the book of Exodus the children of Israel passed through the Red Sea. The waters of the Red Sea were a judgment upon Pharaoh and his Egyptian army. But that same water separated the children of Israel from Egypt, which typifies the corrupted world. Just as Noah and his family were separated from their corrupted generation by the waters of the flood, so the children of Israel were separated from the corrupted world by the waters of the Red Sea. In the New Testament we also have water, the water of baptism. Baptism saves us from the world and separates us from it.</p>
<p>Christians today argue about the proper form of baptism but miss the true significance of baptism. To be baptized is to pass through the judging water to be separated from today&rsquo;s evil generation. If we see the real significance of baptism, we will never go back to the world after we are baptized. The waters of baptism are the waters that judge the world. We might have loved the world in the past, but we have been saved from the world, not by the ritual, the rite, of baptism but by the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>which water, as the antitype</em> in 1 Peter 3:21 refers to the water mentioned in verse 20, of which the water of baptism is the antitype. This indicates that Noah and his family&rsquo;s passing through the flood within the ark was a type of our passing through baptism. The water of the flood delivered them out of the old manner of life into a new environment; in like manner the water of baptism delivers us out of the inherited vain manner of life into a manner of life of resurrection in Christ. Christ redeemed us for this (1:18-19). Christ&rsquo;s redemption was accomplished by Christ&rsquo;s death and was accepted and applied to us, in baptism, by the Spirit through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Now our daily walk should be in the Spirit of the resurrected Christ; it should be a walk in which we live Christ in resurrection through the life power of His Spirit (Rom. 6:4-5). This is a new and excellent manner of life that glorifies God (1 Pet. 2:12).</p>
<p>The ark of Noah typifies Christ in resurrection passing through death. When Christ was living on earth, He had not yet died on the cross and therefore had not yet been resurrected. Nevertheless, in John 11:25 He said to Martha, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo; This reveals clearly that Christ, even before His death and resurrection, was both life and resurrection. He was always the Christ of resurrection. The ark of Noah, therefore, signifies this Christ of resurrection passing through death.</p>
<p>If the ark of Noah did not represent the Christ of resurrection, how could the ark pass through the water and come out safely? The ark&rsquo;s passing through the water and coming out of the water signifies Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, since the ark itself is a type of Christ. How is it possible for Christ, and Christ alone, to enter into death and come out of it? Christ could come forth out of death in resurrection because He is resurrection and is of resurrection. Because Christ is the unique One of resurrection, He had the strength to pass through death. According to Acts 2:24, death could not hold Christ, but when any other person enters into the realm of death, he is held there. It is not possible for anyone else to come out of it. Christ not only entered into death and passed through it; He even deliberately stayed in the realm of death for three days. When those three days were over, He walked out of death. Because Christ is resurrection, He could simply walk out of death. This is signified by the ark of Noah, which entered into, stayed in, passed through, and came out of the death waters. This is a type of Christ in resurrection.</p>
<p>In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) to come into us (John 20:22) and to impart His resurrection life to us. Now this resurrection life with the life-giving Spirit makes every aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death real and effective to us in our experience.</p>
<p>First Peter 3:21 ends with the phrase <em>through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</em> This indicates that baptism is through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life. Without the Spirit of Christ as the reality, baptism by water is only an empty and dead ritual. We appeal to God for a good conscience through the resurrected Christ as the reality of baptism.</p>
<p>Apart from the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we could not have resurrection life, and we could not have the life-giving Spirit within us. Through faith and baptism we have an organic union with the Triune God. It is through the resurrection of Christ that we are brought into the Triune God to have an organic union with Him. Now in the Triune God and with the Triune God, we enjoy the divine life and the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, after we have been baptized, we have the divine life and the life-giving Spirit to make the figure of baptism real and living to us in our experience.</p>
<p>Verse 21 emphasizes baptism in relation to the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The reality of baptism can be realized only by the divine life and the life-giving Spirit. Our basis for saying this is Peter&rsquo;s word &ldquo;through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; It was in His resurrection that Christ released the divine life so that it could be imparted into our spirit. It was also in resurrection that Christ became the life-giving Spirit to come into our spirit, dwell in our spirit, and exercise all the riches of His divine life. It is through the resurrection of Christ that we genuinely experience with assurance the reality of what is figured in baptism.</p><h2 class="head4">c. Being at the Right Hand of God,<br />
Having Gone into Heaven, Angels, Authorities,<br />
and Powers Being Subjected to Him</h2>
<p>First Peter 3:22 tells us that Christ &ldquo;is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to Him.&rdquo; Immediately after mentioning the baptism, Peter speaks of the angels and authorities and powers being subjected to Christ. This shows not only the power of Christ but also the authority that He possesses. When we baptize others into the name of the Lord Jesus, we are doing a powerful thing. This is because we are baptizing them into the name of One who is more powerful than the angels, authorities, and powers.</p>
<p>This additional word not only unveils to us the glorious result of the suffering of Christ&mdash;His exaltation after His resurrection and the high and honorable position He now holds in the heavens at the right hand of God&mdash;but also indicates how glorious and honorable is the organic union we have entered into with Him through baptism, for we were baptized into Him (Rom. 6:3; Gal. 3:27).</p>
<p>Today the resurrected Christ is at the right hand of God. Christ has gone into heaven, and angels, authorities, and powers have all been subjected to Him. Through baptism we have been put into Christ, and now we have an organic union with Him. The Christ to whom we have been joined organically is not only the resurrected One but also the ascended One. Therefore, through the organic union we are brought not only into Christ&rsquo;s resurrection but also into His ascension and exaltation. This means that, because we are in Christ, the angels, authorities, and powers are subject to us as well as to Him. We are one with the crucified, resurrected, and exalted Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Our Sanctifying Him as Lord in Our Hearts<br />
with a Good Manner of Life in Him</h2>
<p>First Peter 3:15-16 says, &ldquo;Sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, being always ready for a defense to everyone who asks of you an account concerning the hope which is in you, yet with meekness and fear, having a good conscience, so that in the matter in which you are spoken against, those who revile your good manner of life in Christ may be put to shame.&rdquo; We need to sanctify Christ as Lord first in our hearts inwardly and then with a good manner of life in Him outwardly. This means that first in our hearts we respect Him as the Lord; then in our behavior we express Him as the Lord in a good manner of life in Him. This expression will cause others to sanctify Him, that is, to see that He is the sanctified Lord.</p>
<p>If we are terrified and troubled by the persecutors (vv. 13-14), it will appear that we do not have the Lord in our hearts. So, in suffering persecution we should show others that we have Christ as Lord within us. This is to sanctify Him, to separate Him, from the other gods, not degrading Him so that He appears to be like the lifeless idols.</p>
<p>In sufferings that come from opposition and persecution, we should sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts. The word <em>sanctify</em> in Greek means to &ldquo;set apart, to separate from things that are common.&rdquo; This is to make something particular and even outstanding. In our suffering of persecution, we should make Christ particular; we should show that He is magnificent, absolutely different from idols. Sanctifying Christ as Lord in our hearts is not a matter of outward activity to set Him apart from what is common; it is an inward matter. To sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts means that when we are under persecution, we have the Lord in our hearts. If we allow the Lord to be the Lord in our hearts when we suffer persecution, we will express Him. This expression spontaneously will sanctify Christ and set Him apart from idols.</p>
<p>If we are timid and fearful when suffering persecution, the Lord will not be sanctified in us. What a shame that would be to Him! It will appear as if we do not have the Lord in our hearts. Whenever we suffer persecution, others must realize that we have Christ within us as Lord. But if we are timid and fearful, others will think that we do not have anything within us. They will have the impression that we do not have the living Lord in us. But if we are bold, sanctifying the Lord in our hearts and expressing Him in our faces, others will realize that we do have something within us. This is to sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts.</p>
<p>In verse 16 Peter goes on to say, &ldquo;Having a good conscience, so that in the matter in which you are spoken against, those who revile your good manner of life in Christ may be put to shame.&rdquo; Since the conscience is a part of our human spirit (Rom. 9:1; 8:16), to care for our conscience is to care for our spirit before God. A Christian&rsquo;s good manner of life should be one that is in Christ. It is a living, a daily life, in the Spirit. This is higher than a living that is merely ethical and moral.</p>
<p>If we would have a good manner of life and sanctify the Lord in our daily life, we must take care of our conscience. It is not sufficient for us to be justified by others. We need to be justified by our own conscience. We should not be satisfied that we are justified by the community, by the brothers, or even by the entire church. No one knows us as thoroughly as our conscience does. This is especially true of the enlightened conscience of the regenerated spirit. A renewed conscience enlightened by the indwelling Spirit is trustworthy in its testimony and accurate in its judgment. The judgment of our enlightened conscience is more accurate than someone else&rsquo;s judgment of us.</p>
<p>The enlightened conscience of our regenerated spirit is an inner judge. This inner judge cooperates with the indwelling God. The reason the enlightened conscience of the regenerated spirit can be an inner judge is that it cooperates with the indwelling God. For this reason, the judgment of the enlightened conscience is thorough and accurate. Therefore, we must take care of our conscience.</p>
<p>In the church life apparently we may be honest and faithful. However, our conscience may know that in certain things we have not been altogether honest and faithful to the church. Therefore, it is very important that we take care of our conscience.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">108. The One Whose Sufferings We Share</h2>
<p>In 1 Peter 4 Christ is presented as the One whose sufferings we share.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Arming Ourselves with the Same Mind<br />
of Christ Who Has Suffered in the Flesh,<br />
That We May Cease from Sin</h2>
<p>First Peter 4:1 says, &ldquo;Since Christ therefore has suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind (because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin).&rdquo; The word <em>arm</em> indicates that the Christian life is a life of battle. We need to arm ourselves, equip ourselves, with the mind of Christ. This indicates that the mind of Christ is a weapon, a part of the armor needed in fighting the battle for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>In verse 1, Peter advises us to arm ourselves with the mind of Christ, who has suffered in the flesh, that we might cease from sin. When we are afraid of suffering, this fear may lead to sin. Hence, we should not be afraid of any kind of suffering; instead, we should arm ourselves with a strong mind, the mind of Christ, who Himself has suffered in the flesh. We need to be strong persons armed with the mind of Christ as a weapon so that we will cease from sin.</p>
<p>One main purpose of 1 Peter is to encourage and exhort the believers to follow the footsteps of Christ in their suffering of persecution (1:6-7; 2:18-25; 3:8-17; 4:12-19). They should have the same mind that Christ had in His suffering (3:18-22). The main function of our mind is to understand and realize. To live a life that follows the footsteps of Christ, we need a renewed mind (Rom. 12:2) to understand and realize the way Christ lived to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>In our practical daily life, the strongest part of our being is our mind. Whatever we do in our living is directed by our mind. It is not the will but the mind that directs our life. All our activities are under the direction of our mind.</p>
<p>Because the mind directs our living, the preaching of the Word must change a person&rsquo;s thoughts. One goal of preaching and teaching is to change people&rsquo;s mind. If we think in a certain way, we will be directed in that way, but if we change our mind and think in another way, our living will then have a different direction. What we think governs what we do, say, and practice. For this reason, Peter charges the believers in 1 Peter 4:1 to arm themselves with the mind of Christ.</p>
<p>To arm ourselves with the mind of Christ is to be armed with the thought and concept of Christ. This implies that we change our way of thinking. Many Christians think that as long as we love God and do His will, we will be under His blessing and will not suffer in any way. It is common for Christians to have the concept that those who love the Lord should not expect suffering. But consider the life of Christ. Christ loved God to the uttermost, and He did God&rsquo;s will fully and absolutely. But what happened to Him in His living? It seems that throughout His life on earth there was not any blessing but only suffering. He was born into a poor family, a family not considered of a high class. Of course, that family was descended from David and thus was of royal lineage. But when the Lord Jesus was born, that royal family was very poor economically. Furthermore, this family did not live in Jerusalem but in the despised town of Nazareth in Galilee. The Lord Jesus lived in Nazareth for more than thirty years. At the beginning of His life, He was put into a manger, and at the end of His life, He was put on the cross. He endured suffering upon suffering. He did not have a good name, and He did not have a place to lay His head. This is the way the Lord Jesus lived when He was on earth. His life was a life of suffering.</p>
<p>If we have the mind of Christ, we will realize that we are living in a rebellious age and in a crooked, perverted generation. Because the age is rebellious and the generation is perverse, the more we love God and do His will, the more we will suffer. We will suffer because we cannot go along with the trend of this age. We care to do the will of God, but the will of God is absolutely contrary to the trend, or tide, of this age. We would love the Lord Jesus, but this is utterly against the trend of this corrupted world. Therefore, if we love the Lord and do God&rsquo;s will, we are bound to suffer. This will be our outlook if we have the mind of Christ.</p>
<p>If we arm ourselves with the mind of Christ for suffering, we will be willing to endure suffering. We will praise the Lord that our suffering is part of our destiny, that God has appointed this for us, and that suffering is the portion of God&rsquo;s children in this age. In 1 Thessalonians 3 Paul tells the believers that God has appointed us to suffering and persecution (v. 3). God has not appointed us to material blessing; He has appointed us to suffering. Therefore, knowing that Christ suffered in the flesh, we also need to arm ourselves with the same mind. We should not have the mind to pray for material blessing. That is to have the wrong kind of mind.</p>
<p>In 1 Peter 4:1 Peter points out that those who have suffered in the flesh have ceased from sin. Pleasure heats up the lusts of our flesh (v. 2); suffering cools them down. The purpose of Christ&rsquo;s redemption is to deliver us from our inherited vain manner of life (1:18-19). Suffering responds to Christ&rsquo;s redemption in fulfilling this purpose, preserving us from a sinful manner of life, from the flood of dissoluteness (4:3-4). Such suffering, mainly from persecution, is God&rsquo;s discipline in His governmental dealing. To undergo such suffering is to be judged, dealt with, and disciplined in the flesh by God (v. 6). Hence, we should arm ourselves with a sober mind to endure such suffering.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s economy, suffering accomplishes a good work for God&rsquo;s children. Suffering very much restricts our lusts. The more material enjoyment people have, the more they will exercise their lusts and indulge in them. But if we suffer poverty, persecution, or illness, this suffering will restrict the indulgence of lust. The devil uses riches to stir up lusts. God, however, uses suffering in the flesh to cause us to cease from sin.</p>
<p>The sufferings are used to arm the believers with a mind against the flesh, that they might not live in the lusts of men but in the will of God (vv. 1-2), that they might share the sufferings of Christ and rejoice at the unveiling of His glory (vv. 12-19), and that they might be witnesses of the sufferings of Christ (5:1).</p>
<p>In 2:11 Peter also speaks of war, the war between the fleshly lusts and the soul: &ldquo;Beloved, I entreat you as strangers and sojourners to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.&rdquo; Both 2:11 and 4:1 refer to the same kind of fighting, to the warfare between the lusts and our soul. According to Peter&rsquo;s word in 4:1, we need to arm ourselves with the mind of Christ in order to fight against the flesh with its lusts.</p>
<p>If we would arm ourselves with the mind of Christ, we must have Christ as our life. If we try to arm ourselves with the same mind without having Christ as our life, we will merely be imitating Christ in an outward way. If we have a strong mind to suffer, although we may suffer for the Lord&rsquo;s interests, nothing of poverty or suffering will stumble us. We must arm ourselves with such a mind, but this should not be out of our natural boldness. This is to follow the Lord Jesus Christ who took this narrow way of a manger and a cross.</p><h2 class="head4">b. His Judging the Living and the Dead</h2>
<p>First Peter 4:5 tells us that Christ &ldquo;is ready to judge the living and the dead.&rdquo; When the Lord comes back, He will judge the living among the nations at His throne of glory and establish His millennial kingdom (Matt. 25:31-46), and He will judge all the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). It is significant that after Peter tells us to have the same mind that Christ had in His suffering, he mentions that Christ will judge the living and the dead. When the Lord Jesus suffered in the flesh and was persecuted by men, He armed Himself with the mind to suffer because He knew that the time was coming when He would judge all human beings, including His persecutors. Likewise, while suffering persecution from others, we need to realize that we also will one day judge the world because we will be the co-kings of Christ (vv. 4-6; 22:5; 1 Cor. 6:2).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. In All Things God Being Glorified through Him</h2>
<p>First Peter 4:11 says, &ldquo;In all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Eventually, in both all that Christ is and has done and all that He will be and do, He will glorify God. This indicates that all our ministry of grace, whether in speaking or in serving, should be full of Christ, so that God may be glorified through Christ in all things.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Our Rejoicing as We Share His Sufferings,<br />
That at the Unveiling of His Glory<br />
We May Also Rejoice Exultingly</h2>
<p>First Peter 4:13 says, &ldquo;Inasmuch as you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice exultingly.&rdquo; Today we rejoice when we share in the sufferings of Christ because at the unveiling of His glory we will participate in His glory (Rom. 8:17-19; 2 Thes. 1:10). At that time we will rejoice exultingly; we will be beside ourselves with joy.</p>
<p>In 1 Peter 4:12, Peter says, &ldquo;Beloved, do not think that the fiery ordeal among you, coming to you for a trial, is strange, as if it were a strange thing happening to you.&rdquo; In verse 13 Peter goes on to speak of our sharing in the sufferings of Christ. Although persecution is a trial that purifies us through burning, eventually Peter says that by experiencing such a fiery ordeal we share, participate in, the sufferings of Christ. It is possible for the sufferings that a Christian undergoes to be the sufferings of Christ. How can the persecutions suffered by us be the sufferings of Christ? If we were not Christians, we certainly would not suffer the kind of persecution described in verses 12 and 13. Such persecutions are due to the fact that we are Christians, men of Christ. Because we believe in Christ, love Christ, live Christ, and bear testimony to Christ, witnessing of Him in this age, the world rises up against us. This age is under the hand of the evil one (1 John 5:19), and for this reason unbelieving ones persecute those who believe in Christ and witness of Him. In the sight of God this kind of suffering is regarded as the sufferings of Christ.</p>
<p>Christ lived a life of suffering. Now we are His partners who live the same kind of life. According to the book of Hebrews, we are not only partakers of Christ but are also His partners (3:14). We cooperate with Him in living a life of suffering. We follow Him along the way of suffering. This means that what Christ suffered, we also suffer. Therefore, when we suffer for Christ in this way, our sufferings are counted by God as the sufferings of Christ.</p>
<p>We should not be discouraged, because we must suffer as Christians. These sufferings are positive and very precious. What a privilege it is to experience the sufferings of Christ! Paul could even say that he made up what was lacking of the sufferings of Christ for the sake of His Body, the church (Col. 1:24). He speaks also in Philippians 3:10 concerning the fellowship of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings. Today we should be Christians, followers of Christ, who undergo the sufferings of Christ. We need to participate not only in the riches of Christ but also in the sufferings of Christ. If we take this point of view, we will be encouraged whenever we suffer for Christ. We may even welcome this kind of suffering. We may face fiery ordeals, but these are the sufferings of Christ in which we have the privilege to participate.</p>
<p>In 1 Peter 4:13 Peter speaks of rejoicing exultingly. This means that we will be joyful not only inwardly but also sound out our joy. At the time of the unveiling of the Lord&rsquo;s glory, we will exult. I believe that we will shout, rejoice, and perhaps even leap for joy; we will be excited to the uttermost, beside ourselves with joy. Today we may rejoice, but when the Lord is unveiled we will rejoice exultingly.</p><h2 class="head4">e. If We Are Reproached in the Name of Christ,<br />
Our Being Blessed, Because the Spirit of Glory<br />
and of God Rests upon Us</h2>
<p>First Peter 4:14 goes on to say, &ldquo;If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.&rdquo; The name denotes the person. To be in the name of Christ is actually to be in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself. The believers, having believed into Christ (John 3:15) and having been baptized into His name (Acts 19:5), that is, into Himself (Gal. 3:27), are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30) and are one with Him (6:17). When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing in His sufferings (1 Pet. 4:13), in the fellowship of His sufferings (Phil. 3:10).</p>
<p>The reason the persecutions we suffer are the sufferings of Christ is that we suffer in the name of Christ. According to Peter&rsquo;s word in 1 Peter 4:14, we are blessed if we are reproached in the name of Christ. We should not think that it is a curse to be reproached in the name of Christ. This is to be blessed. However, it may be a curse if people appreciate us too highly. Regarding this matter, we need to have a change of concept.</p>
<p>Peter tells us in verse 14 that if we are reproached in the name of Christ, the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon us. Literally, the Greek says, &ldquo;The Spirit of glory and that of God.&rdquo; The Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God. The Spirit of glory is the One through whom Christ was glorified in His resurrection (Rom. 1:4). This Spirit of glory, being the Spirit of God Himself, rests upon the suffering believers in their persecution, for the glorifying of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory (1 Pet. 4:13). When we are willing to suffer for Christ, deep within we sense the Spirit of glory and of God&mdash;the Spirit expressed as glory&mdash;resting upon us. Today we all can experience and enjoy this aspect of Christ.</p>
<p>The Spirit of glory rests upon the persecuted believers to glorify God. The more we suffer and are persecuted, the more glory there will be upon us. This is truly a blessing. The more we are persecuted and evil spoken of, the more we are empowered. Persecution and reproach would not hold us down. On the contrary, they should lift us up. Therefore, we should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory is resting upon us.</p>
<p>If we Christians suffer for Christ, then the Spirit within us will be the Spirit of glory. On the positive side, all sufferings work out one thing; that is, they break the outer man. Then when our outer man is broken, the glory in the Holy of Holies, that is, in our spirit, will be manifested. The more we suffer in the name of Christ, the more the Spirit of glory will be manifest.</p>
<p>Verse 14 tells us that the Spirit is of glory, that He is full of glory. Furthermore, the phrase <em>the Spirit of glory and of God</em> means that the Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God. When we are persecuted for the Lord, the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of glory, rests upon us.</p>
<p>Glory is God manifested, God expressed. With the martyrs, usually at the moment they suffer martyrdom, there is a condition showing that God is expressed. This is the Spirit of glory and of God resting upon them. When Stephen was being tried, those in the Sanhedrin saw his face as though it were the face of an angel (Acts 6:15); that was the glory of God being manifested. This was because the Spirit of glory was resting upon him.</p>
<p>When Christians suffer for the Lord, the Spirit of Christ rests upon them to express and release God from within them. When people suffer for a worldly matter, they are troubled so much that they always have a sad or distressed expression and are unable to get through. However, Christians are not like this, because the indwelling Spirit, who is also the Spirit of glory, rests upon them to manifest the glory of God.</p>
<p>If we are willing to be persecuted for the Lord and suffer under God&rsquo;s governmental dealing, the Spirit of glory and of God will rest upon us. When we suffer for the name of the Lord, the Spirit becomes the Spirit of glory resting upon us. To be a martyr is not to be put to death with bitterness. Rather, to be a martyr is a matter of gladness and glory. What is a suffering to the people of the world is a glory to us, the believers. When we suffer under God&rsquo;s governmental dealing, there is always a glory. The Spirit of glory rests upon us to help us in our suffering, and while we are suffering, this Spirit of glory gives us the hope of glory (Col. 1:27) so that our suffering will be in the way of glory.</p>
<p>When we are reproached in the name of Christ, the Son of God, we are blessed because the Spirit of glory and of God the Father rests upon us. In the persecution of the believers, the three of the Divine Trinity are fully involved. They are wrapped up with the persecuted believers. When the believers of the Son are reproached, the Triune God is enjoying His rest by staying with them in their persecution. The Spirit of glory and of God the Father is resting upon the believers. The word <em>rests</em> in 1 Peter 4:14 means &ldquo;to stay, abide, comfort, sustain, cover, and protect.&rdquo; While the Spirit of glory is staying with us, the suffering ones, He becomes our sustaining power, our protection, our covering, and our victory, yet with Him it is a resting. This explains the real situation of Christian persecution. When we are being persecuted, our Triune God is covering us, protecting us, sustaining us, and comforting us. He is resting upon us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">f. As a Christian in Reproach,<br />
He Not Being Ashamed in This Name<br />
but Glorifying God in This Name</h2>
<p>In 1 Peter 4:16 we are told that &ldquo;if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.&rdquo; As Christians in reproach, we should not be ashamed of the name <em>Christian,</em> a despised term in Peter&rsquo;s time, but rather glorify God in this name, that is, to express God in glory.</p>
<p>The Greek word <em>Christianos</em> is a word formed from Latin. The ending <em>ianos,</em> denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire. One who worshipped the emperor, the Caesar, or <em>Kaisar,</em> was called <em>Kaisarianos,</em> which means an &ldquo;adherent of Kaisar, a person who belongs to Kaisar.&rdquo; When people believed in Christ and became His followers, some in the Empire came to consider Christ a rival of their <em>Kaisar.</em> Then, at Antioch (Acts 11:26) they began to call the followers of Christ <em>Christianoi</em> (Christians), adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach. Hence, this verse says, &ldquo;As a Christian, let him not be ashamed&rdquo;; that is, if any believer suffers at the hands of the persecutors who contemptuously call him a Christian, he should not feel ashamed but should glorify God in this name.</p>
<p>Today the term <em>Christian</em> should bear a positive meaning, that is, a man of Christ, one who is one with Christ, not only belonging to Him but also having His life and nature in an organic union with Him, and who is living by Him, even living Him, in his daily life. If we suffer for being such a person, we should not feel ashamed but should be bold to magnify Christ in our confession by our holy and excellent manner of life to glorify (express) God in this name.</p><h1 class="series">THE CONCLUSION<br />

<h2 class="head3">109. The Chief Shepherd</h2>
<p>In 1 Peter 5 Christ is presented as the Chief Shepherd.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. A Witness of His Sufferings Being<br />
Also a Partaker of the Glory to Be Revealed</h2>
<p>1 Peter 5:1 says, &ldquo;The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory to be revealed.&rdquo; Today we should be witnesses and partakers of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings so that we will be partakers of His glory to be revealed.</p>
<p>Peter and the early apostles were witnesses of Christ (Acts 1:8), not only as eyewitnesses testifying of what they had seen of Christ&rsquo;s suffering (5:32; 10:39) but also as martyrs vindicating their testimony by suffering martyrdom for Him (22:20; 2 Cor. 1:8-9; 4:10-11; 11:23; 1 Cor. 15:31). This is to share in the sufferings of Christ (1 Pet. 4:13), to participate in the fellowship of His sufferings (Phil. 3:10).</p>
<p>Peter also says in 1 Peter 5:1 that he is a partaker of the glory to be revealed. Peter was first a witness, a martyr, and a partaker of the sufferings of Christ. Then he was a partaker of His glory (Rom. 8:17). Christ Himself had gone the same way (1 Pet. 1:11; Luke 24:26). In Greek, <em>witness</em> and <em>martyr</em> are the same word. This indicates that we need to bear testimony as a witness even at the risk of being a martyr, of sacrificing our lives.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, Peter gave a strong testimony, witnessing of the sufferings of Christ. He boldly told the Jews that they had crucified the Lord Jesus. Before the day of Pentecost, however, Peter was not bold but timid. The night the Lord Jesus was betrayed Peter denied that he was one of His followers. In the presence of the Lord, Peter denied Him. But on the day of Pentecost Peter had the boldness to rebuke the Jews for crucifying the Lord Jesus. After that, Peter began to suffer persecution. He was arrested and put into prison. He was willing to risk his life to be a witness for the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Peter, no doubt, remembered the Lord&rsquo;s word in Acts 1 about witnesses. When the disciples asked the Lord about the restoring of the kingdom to Israel, He replied, &ldquo;It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set by His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (vv. 7-8). Peter was the first to become such a witness. He was a leading witness, a martyr, one who was willing to sacrifice his life to testify of the sufferings of Christ. Eventually, Peter himself was martyred. He sacrificed his life as part of his witness for Christ. This was the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s word to him in John 21:18, a word concerning &ldquo;by what kind of death he would glorify God&rdquo; (v. 19). When Peter wrote his second Epistle, he knew that the time of his martyrdom was near: &ldquo;Knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is imminent, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me&rdquo; (1:14).</p>
<p>We need to be witnesses of the sufferings of Christ. This means that we should be ready to sacrifice our lives as part of our testimony. Being a partaker of Christ&rsquo;s glory depends on being such a martyr. If we are willing to be martyred, if we are willing to risk our lives, then surely we will be partakers of the glory to be revealed. But if we are not willing to sacrifice our lives, then instead of partaking of glory at the Lord&rsquo;s coming, we will probably be rebuked by Him.</p>
<p>In 1 Peter 4:19 Peter says, &ldquo;So then let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.&rdquo; Here, <em>well-doing</em> refers to doing right, good, and noble deeds. Committing our souls to a faithful Creator is effective only if we are engaged in well-doing, that is, if we are doing noble deeds. Nothing is more noble than dying as a martyr for the Lord.</p>
<p>When we act in such a noble way, we have the ground to commit our souls to a faithful Creator. He is altogether faithful. When the Lord Jesus was being tried before His crucifixion, Peter was not at all noble. But later, in the book of Acts, Peter witnessed for Christ before his persecutors in a noble way. For example, Peter and John said to the persecutors, &ldquo;Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you judge; for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard&rdquo; (Acts 4:19-20). Peter and the other apostles committed their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator. Surely Peter was able to say, &ldquo;Lord, You are faithful to me. Now I would be faithful to You. I would be faithful to You at the cost of my life.&rdquo; Certainly the Lord would honor such a noble commitment.</p>
<p>Because Peter was a noble witness, a noble martyr, he had the assurance that he would be a partaker of the coming glory. Whether we will be partakers of the glory to come depends upon how noble and faithful we are as witnesses. We must be willing to sacrifice ourselves. We should always have the willingness to sacrifice ourselves. We need to sacrifice our time, our energy, and our life. If we are willing to sacrifice in this way, then we will be witnesses of the sufferings of Christ and partakers of the coming glory. First, we must participate in Christ&rsquo;s suffering; only then can we share in Christ&rsquo;s glory.</p><h2 class="head4">b. When He, the Chief Shepherd, Is Manifested,<br />
Our Receiving the Unfading Crown of Glory</h2>
<p>First Peter 5:4 says, &ldquo;When the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.&rdquo; Today we are following the steps of Christ as the Chief Shepherd, suffering what He has suffered. Yet when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, we will receive the reward of the unfading crown of glory.</p>
<p>Christ is our Chief Shepherd, and He is the Head of all the shepherds. He leads us to feed, look after, teach, and guide the flock of God according to God&rsquo;s intention and to become patterns of the flock (vv. 2-3). Christ is the Chief Shepherd, and the believers are shepherds. As the Chief Shepherd, He must have a flock of shepherds under Him. We are not simply flocks of sheep but flocks of shepherds.</p>
<p>Christ is the Chief Shepherd, shepherding His flock through the elders of the churches (vv. 1-4). All the elders are subordinate shepherds. Christ as the Head is the Chief Shepherd. Actually, we are not the ones who are shepherding. When we shepherd, it should be Christ shepherding through us; it should be He who is in us urging us to shepherd others. Unless the Lord is doing the shepherding, how can we be shepherds? When we go to visit a brother and the Lord goes with us, that truly makes a difference. If we shepherd people apart from Christ, such shepherding is not in resurrection but in the old creation. When Christ shepherds through us, our labor is in resurrection. Only Christ is resurrection. Whatever is divine is resurrection. All the elders must learn to shepherd the churches, not by themselves in the old creation but by Christ as the shepherding Chief in resurrection.</p>
<p>The reward to the elders will be the unfading crown of glory, which they will receive at the manifestation of the Chief Shepherd (v. 4). At the apostle&rsquo;s time crowns were given to victors in athletic games (1 Cor. 9:25; 2 Tim. 4:8). Those were corruptible crowns, whose glory faded. The crown given by the Lord to the faithful elders will be a reward for their loyal service. The glory of this crown will never fade. It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers&rsquo; enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ (2 Pet. 1:11). Christ is the Chief Shepherd who will reward the faithful elders, who shepherd God&rsquo;s flock faithfully, with the unfading crown of glory for their encouragement.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. In Him God Having Called Us<br />
into His Eternal Glory</h2>
<p>First Peter 5:10 says, &ldquo;The God of all grace, He who has called you into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you.&rdquo; The expression <em>in Christ Jesus</em> indicates that the God of all grace went through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish the complete and full redemption so that He may bring His redeemed people into an organic union with Himself. Thus, they may participate in the riches of the Triune God as their enjoyment. All the steps of the divine operation are in Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God and who became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the bountiful life supply to us. It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based on all His achievements, that God can be the God of all grace to call us into His eternal glory and to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in the Triune God (1:1-2) as the solid foundation, thus enabling us to attain to His glorious goal. What a miracle that fallen sinners can be brought into God&rsquo;s eternal glory! And how excellent is His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work in us! This is all accomplished through His &ldquo;all grace&rdquo; which is the &ldquo;true grace&rdquo; (5:12). According to what Peter says in 5:10, our sufferings are only for a little while, but God&rsquo;s glory is eternal. After we have suffered a little while, the God of all grace will personally perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Peace to All Who Are in Him</h2>
<p>First Peter 5:14 says, &ldquo;Peace to you all who are in Christ.&rdquo; Peace results from grace and issues from the enjoyment of the Triune God. Such enjoyment of God as the multiplying and multiplied grace (1:2), the varied grace (4:10), the all grace (5:10), and the true grace (v. 12), as the reality of the contents of the Christian life under the government of God, issues and results in a condition of peace with both God and man.</p>
<p>First Peter presents many different aspects of the sweet experience and enjoyment of Christ. We may be limited in our experience and enjoyment of Christ. Yet when we consider all these precious items of Christ revealed in 1 Peter, we can see a view of the rich enjoyment that we may have in Him.</p></body></html>
