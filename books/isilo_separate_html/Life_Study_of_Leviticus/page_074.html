ALL THE FAT THAT COVERS THE INWARDS AND THAT IS ON THE INWARDS, THE TWO KIDNEYS AND THE FAT ON THEM, AND THE APPENDAGE ON THE LIVER BEING BURNED ON THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING</h2><p>All the fat that covers the inwards and that is on the inwards, the two kidneys and the fat on them, and the appendage on the liver were burned on the altar of burnt offering (Lev. 4:8-10, 19, 26, 31, 35). This signifies that the inwards of Christ as the tender and sweet part are offered to God for His satisfaction that He may be willing to forgive us.<p>These parts of the sin offering were burned on the altar of burnt offering. This indicates that God&#8217;s acceptance of the sin offering is based on the burnt offering. Without the burnt offering as the base, the sin offering cannot be accepted by God.<h2 class=head1>VIII. THE WHOLE OFFERING, INCLUDING ITS HIDE, ALL ITS FLESH, WITH ITS HEAD. LEGS, INWARDS, AND DUNG, TO BE BURNED OUTSIDE THE CAMP</h2><p>The whole offering, including its hide, all its flesh, with its head, legs, inwards, and dung, was burned outside the camp (vv. 11-12, 21). This signifies that Christ as the sin offering suffered reproach outside the Jewish religion-a human organization (Heb. 13:11-13). Christ was crucified outside Jerusalem, which was considered a camp representing the Jewish religious organization.<h2 class=head2>A. At a Clean Place</h2><p>The sin offering was burned at a clean place. This signifies the place where Christ as the sin offering was rejected by man and where man&#8217;s sin is cleared.<h2 class=head2>B. At the Place Where the Ashes Are Poured Out</h2><p>The place where the sin offering was burned was a place where the ashes were poured out.<h2 class=head3>1. The Ashes of the Burnt Offering</h2><p>The ashes of the burnt offering signify God&#8217;s recognition and acceptance of the offerings. How do we know that God has accepted the burnt offering? We know this by the fact that it has been turned to ashes. Because the ashes are a sign that God has received the burnt offering, the ashes are dear.<h2 class=head3>2. For the Offerers&#8217; Assurance and Peace</h2><p>The ashes are for the offerers&#8217; assurance and peace in their heart concerning God&#8217;s redemption of their sin. The ashes are a sign assuring us that God has accepted our sin offering for the redemption of our sin.<h2 class=head1>IX. WHEN ALL THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL SINNED IGNORANTLY, THE ELDERS WERE TO REPRESENT THE ASSEMBLY TO OFFER THE SIN OFFERING</h2><p>When all the congregation of Israel sinned ignorantly, the elders were to represent the assembly to offer the sin offering (vv. 13-15). This signifies that the elders of the church may represent the church to offer Christ as its sin offering.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> </body></html>
