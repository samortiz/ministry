   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BLASPHEMING THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: What is the explanation of Matthew 12:31-32?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What was the reason behind those words?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Please instruct me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chung Nai-Cheng</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Answer: To sin by blaspheming the Holy Spirit was for men to harden their hearts when they knew v. 27 that the Lord Jesus Himself had cast out demons by the Holy Spirit v. 28 , and for them to say that He cast out the demons by the ruler of the demons v. 24 . This sin occurred only in those days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus came to the world to save men; all sins against Him and all other sins can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But those who blasphemed the Holy Spirit, who purposely disbelieved when clear proofs were there, and who spoke blasphemous words had their hearts hardened to a point beyond repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As such, their sin remained and could not be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE BIRTH DATE OF THE SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Question: Some consider it inaccurate to say that the Savior was born on December 25th.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What then is the actual date?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some oppose meetings on Christmas Day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Should Christians remember Him on this day or not?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chung, Chekiang</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Answer: The Bible does not tell us on which day the Savior was born.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shows that God does not want man to know the date.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>December 25th came from the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>History tells us that this date was fixed by man, and it is therefore not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God only commands us to remember the Lord at His supper 1 Cor 11:23-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not add anything to what God has not spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, Christians should not go along with men to celebrate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A PORTRAIT OF THIS AGE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Question: Matthew 11:16-17 say, "But to what shall I liken this generation?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is like little children sitting in the market places, who call to the others and say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not mourn."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have considered it over and over again, and I am not able to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, I am sending you this letter especially to inquire about this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wang Hua-Wu</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Answer: The explanation of these two verses is in the following two verses, 18 and 19.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus came and preached the gospel; He is the Bridegroom who gives man the new wine, and His mission is recorded in Luke 4:18-19.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His preaching of the glad tidings was like a kind of piping to them, yet that generation did not respond in joy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John the Baptist came and preached repentance, and he told people that every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How sobering this is!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet, that generation heard him mourn in such a way, but did not lament with repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Men of this age are the same!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have heard about hell, but are still not fearful; they have heard about heaven, but are still not joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their end will indeed be pitiful!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE NEW AND THE OLD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Question: What does Matthew 13:52 mean by the things new and old?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Can it mean the mixture of the new and the old religion?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What will happen if I cannot follow Jesus' teaching in John 15:13?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Please answer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lee, Linshui</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Answer: Matthew 13:52 is speaking about the importance of understanding the parables of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The new and old things do not have any specific reference.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What the Lord Jesus meant was that if the scribes understood the words concerning the kingdom of the heavens, they would be able to teach others easily, like being able to bring forth things new and old out of their treasury at will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A BLOODY HUSBAND</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Question: In Exodus 4:24-26, why did God want to kill Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How do you explain "a bloody husband"?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lee, Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Answer: Moses was about to represent the law, but his son was not yet circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order to be under the law, he had to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 26 tells us the meaning of a bloody husband.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was stained with blood through circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why he was called a bloody husband.</S>
