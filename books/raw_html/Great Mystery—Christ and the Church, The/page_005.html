        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING GOD AND MAN<br />
AND BEING THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING TO BE MAN&rsquo;S CONTENT</h2>
<p>We have seen that the Triune God desires that man, as His vessel, would contain Him; He desires to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and content (Gen. 1:26; 2:8-9; Rom. 9:23-24). This is the deep mystery in the Bible. A person who does not contain God is an empty vessel, having an appearance of a vessel but no genuine content. God&rsquo;s intention is to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life, to live in man, and to be lived out from man. Thus, God and man are not only joined but also mingled. God and man have become one; God is the content, and man is the expression. This is glorious and meaningful.</p>
<p>The human race is corrupt and society is dark because people are empty within and do not know the meaning of their human life. They lack a stabilizing force and a rich content. However, as genuine Christians, we are different because we have God within us. Hence, we can declare, &ldquo;Hallelujah, we have God in us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was saved when I was nineteen years old. Before my salvation I was an empty vessel. When I consider those nineteen years, I can only sigh (Psa. 90:9). Because I was born and raised in a Christian home and educated in Christian schools, I constantly heard Christian doctrine. Once, a few classmates entered a Buddhist temple, and I told my classmates, &ldquo;This god is an idol, a false god. Only the God in whom we Christians believe is true. He is the unique Creator and the source of all things. We need to worship Him.&rdquo; Even though I testified for God in such a way, He had not yet entered into me; I was an empty man. I knew that God is true, but for me He only existed in the heavens; He was not in me. He filled the universe, but He did not fill me. Because I was still empty, I was happy to accompany my classmates or colleagues to Chinese operas, and I found playing cards interesting.</p>
<p>Nineteen years of emptiness is a long time, but it is merely a quarter of my present age. A quarter of my life was empty, without God, without content, and without power, but three-quarters of my life has been filled with glory, sweetness, and joy. Some people say that I am always full of energy and that I do not look like an old man. It is obvious that I am an old man, but while I am outwardly getting older, I am getting younger within. Our God is evergreen. He is from eternity (93:2), but He is not old. He is like a green fir tree (Hosea 14:8). Because such a God has become my content, I am becoming younger even while I am physically getting older. I am full of joy.</p>
<p>The younger saints are blessed because they can be filled with God in their youth. However, in addition to being filled with God, we also need to be saturated with God and allow Him to be expressed through us. One of our hymns says, &ldquo;Thy Spirit will me saturate, / Every part will God permeate&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #501). I hope that the younger saints will be saturated and permeated with God until God can be seen in every part of their being, that is, until God is in their tongue, eyes, shoulders, walk, and words. Then they will be young persons who truly belong to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE EXPLANATION<br />
OF THE MYSTERIOUS GOD</h2>
<p>The God who has entered into us is a mystery. Every intelligent person knows that there must be a Sovereign Being in the universe. This Sovereign Being must not be simple and must possess complete wisdom and the highest virtues. We know this from looking at the man whom God created. The man whom God created is lovely in his appearance and wonderful in his makeup. Why does the nose not point upward? Why do the eyebrows not grow under the eyes? Man would be ugly if the nose pointed upward and the eyebrows grew under the eyes. Not only so, dust would fall into the nostrils, and sweat would flow into the eyes. Just by looking at a mirror we know that man is the most beautiful creature. No one can improve the human face that God designed. Architecture and clothing are always changing and improving, but the structure of the human body cannot be changed or improved. It is not good to have three shoulders or four ears. Who created our hands, which are capable and very beautiful? Our parents gave birth to us, but they did not determine our appearance. Our appearance was designed by God. Just by looking at ourselves, we can prove the existence of God.</p>
<p>God is not simple, but where is He? Some people say that He is in heaven, because the Bible says so (Amos 9:6; Matt. 5:34). However, He is not only in heaven; He is also with and in us (28:20; 2 Tim. 4:22). God is a mystery, and this mystery is Christ. Paul speaks of the &ldquo;full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ&rdquo; (Col. 2:2). This means that everything of God&rsquo;s being is wonderful and mysterious, but this mystery is embodied in Christ (v. 9). As the embodiment of God, Christ explains the mystery of God and expresses the wonderful God (John 1:18). Apart from Christ, no one can see God (14:7-9). God is in Christ (v. 10), and Christ is the practical God, the manifested God, and the explained God.</p>
<p>How is Christ the mystery of God? In the book of Colossians Paul reveals many points concerning Christ. Every point in this book is mysterious and incomprehensible, but we can receive and enjoy these points.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
