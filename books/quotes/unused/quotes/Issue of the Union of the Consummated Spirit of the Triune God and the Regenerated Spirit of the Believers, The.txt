Lord, we ask You to give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation, a spirit that can comprehend and penetrate, a spirit that can see and obtain
Lord, our lips, our ears, the eyes of our heart, and our spirit within all need the cleansing of Your precious blood
In the same way, every point in the Bible is mysterious, and the particular details in each point are inexhaustible
Simply speaking, this refers to the issue produced from the fact of the union of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man
He has passed through at least the five processes of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension
After passing through the sixty-six books, at the end of Revelation the Bible speaks of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth
Originally, God was simply God; but after passing through the processes, God has been consummated to become a God-man
The aggregate of this God and the totality of the believers become a couple in eternity to be God's increase and expression for eternity
The coming New Jerusalem is a constitution of the processed Triune God and the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified believers
Jasper is produced by the transforming work of the Spirit, who is joined to the believers as the totality of the Body of Christ
How can this God who is holy righteous and bright give His life to us the human beings who are not holy not righteous and not bright
He is also the pneumatic Christ Himself who has the bountiful supply of the experience of human living death and resurrection in His flesh
He is the bountiful supply in the aspects of His incarnation, His human living, His death, and His resurrection
In verse 45 it says that in the resurrec-tion of Christ the last Adam, who is Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit
The Spirit is not only the consummation of the processed Triune God but also the aggregate of the processed Triune God
In the universe the Holy Spirit, the consummated Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, is the reality of resurrection
Those who have experience can testify that in reading the Bible, we need to repeat our reading a few more times
The first stanza says, 'Glory be to God the Father, /And to Christ the Son,/Glory to the Holy Spirit /Ever One'
Stanza two says, 'As we view the vast creation, /Planned with wondrous skill,/So our hearts would move to worship,/And be still'
Regardless of whether it is the word of the Bible or the hymns if we read with a spirit of prayer often we will be moved and will shed tears
In these last days the seven Spirits enable the believers to become overcomers in the midst of the degraded situation of the church
Today, in order to be the overcomers in the midst of the degradation of the church, we must have the sevenfold intensified Spirit
Prayer: Lord, we not only worship You as the speaking God, but even more we worship You that You are the Word and this Word is the Spirit
Such a God passed through these processes, first that He might make God man, and ultimately that He might make man God
God created all things after their own kind, but He created man not according to mankind but according to God's kind
Since God is Spirit, if there were no spirit in man, there would be no way for man to contact this God who is Spirit
Concerning the angels, although they are not evil, they are merely serving spirits ; hence, they are insignificant
Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him'
The house of Jacob, consisting of seventy persons, went down to Egypt, but the Bible did not say 'seventy persons' but 'seventy souls'
On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were saved, yet the Bible says, 'There were added on that day about three thousand souls'
Through the redeeming death of Christ, the spirit of man has been enlivened through the resurrection of Christ
Regeneration is to remake, rebuild, and reconstitute us to be a person of the new creation with God, Christ, and life as the elements
In the believers' regenerated spirit there is the life of God as the second life of the believers, that is, the new life of the believers
The regenerated spirit of the believers becomes the dwelling place of the processed and consummated Triune God in the believers
John 14:23 says, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
If God does not dwell in man, God will not be able to become man; if man does not dwell in God, neither will man be able to become God
For God to become man, He must gain man as His home; for man to become God, he needs to obtain God as his home
On God's side, in order to dwell with man, He Himself had to pass through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
On man's side, in order to dwell with God, man likewise has to pass through regeneration, sanctification, renewing, and transformation
All these are the work of building the dwelling place of God and man so that ultimately God and man can become a mutual dwelling place
The regenerated spirit of the believers is also the organ for the believers to receive God's wisdom, revelation, and vision
When the regenerated spirit of the believers spreads into their mind, the mind of the believers becomes a renewed mind
The regenerated spirit of the believers becomes the renewing spirit in their mind that their entire being may be renewed
The Spirit of God is no longer like a single hand that cannot produce clapping sounds; rather, the two spirits can 'clap' together
The God-man life is a living of the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man joined and mingled together as one
We have used this term union quite much, but concerning the union of God and man, we do not have adequate knowledge
The union of God and man is altogether a matter of the union of the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man
The first thirty-nine books are the Old Testament, which has nothing to do with the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man
In the New Testament the four Gospels record the greatest thing that ever happened in the universe, that is, God coming to be a man
The four Gospels as the first books of the New Testament specifically speak about God's living on the earth as a man
God was on the earth, yet He was not expressed in the image of God; rather, He was manifested fully in the likeness of man
The union of God and man, causing the two to be one, is a matter that is most difficult to study and understand in the Bible
Because of the absence of the culture of the union of God and man, there is a shortage of language to express it
The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers brings God into man that God and man may be joined and mingled together
Outside the Lord's recovery, in Catholicism, Protestantism, and the Moslem religion, nearly no one teaches this matter
They do not know this mystery of the two natures of God and man blended to become one yet without producing a third nature
The Spirit of God regenerates the believers in their receiving spirit with the life of God that they may become children of God
Austin-Sparks, who said that regeneration is for man to have another life, the life of God, in addition to the human life he already has
The regeneration revealed in the Bible is not a religion, nor is it a set of moral teachings for improving oneself
We should not live by our original life, our first life; rather, we must deny our first life and live by our second life
What the Lord desires is that we would not speak out of ourselves but out of the life of God that is within us
Paul said, 'O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified'?
In the original language the word sanctification has the meaning of being separated or set apart in a strong way
Sanctification by separation is for sanctification by transformation, and the latter is for the transformation of our entire being
In the matter of our sanctification, the Spirit of God first comes into our spirit to separate us in order to make us holy
Regeneration requires the life of God to beget us whereas sanctification requires the nature of God in His life to separate and transform us
Our mind becomes like the mind of God; our emotion becomes like the emotion of God; and our will becomes like the will of God
The second step is that He has to sanctify us by separating and transforming us with the divine nature in His life
Besides these, God's attributes also include His being forever new, never becoming old, and being everlasting and unfading
We all know that in the old creation, anything, even if it is not used, will become old and decrepit after a period of time
Romans 12:2 says, 'And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
We do not say 'Christ' but 'the firstborn Son of God,' because we are being conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son
Conformation is also the preparation of the believers before the transfiguration and glorification of their body
The work of the Spirit of God in glorifying the believers begins with His regenerating the believers with the life of God's glory
If this were not so, even though the gospel of God is 'powerful' , it still would not have any power or accomplish anything in the believers
In the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, from Genesis to Malachi, what is recorded are superficial matters that are on the surface
When we come to the New Testament, things are no longer superficial, just on the surface; the New Testament is full of fruit
It has nothing to do with man's work, effort, ways, ideas, moral teachings, philosophy, or any religious system or activities
Most of the work in today's Christianity is human work, is natural, and has nothing to do with the building up of the Body of Christ
Not only so Paul also told him that he was already resurrected with Christ and his every move and action needed to have the newness of life
They also preach that Christians living on the earth have consolation and hope, and that after they die they will go to heaven
The gospel that Paul preached was according to the revelation of God for the building up of the Body of Christ
The Triune God has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
It is not ordinary men who are the framework, but the believers whom God has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed
The Body of Christ is not a matter of being universal or local, but a matter of the outward framework and the inward element
A house is built by first laying the foundation, then setting up the frame, and then putting pieces of stone on the frame
From God's viewpoint, we were all regenerated through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus on the day of His resurrection
When the Spirit of God regenerates people from within, it is not He Himself who preaches the gospel directly to men to regenerate them
When we speak to people, we must also have a certain skill, like that of a nurse who goes to someone's home to give him an injection
Through the mutual supply in the spirit the members of Christ grow together, resulting in the building up of the Body of Christ
The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is dispensed and transfused into us day by day and thereby is built into us day by day
Similarly, the Triune God through His dispensing, transfusing, and building becomes us and is built up together with us
It is divinity constituted into humanity to be man's dwelling place, and it is humanity built into divinity to be God's dwelling place
It is also based on this portion that we say that the Body of Christ is the union and mingling of God and His redeemed people
From this portion of the Bible, how can we prove that the people redeemed by God are the outward framework of the Body of Christ?
The redeemed people as the outward framework of the Body of Christ have become the new creation in the Triune God
How can we prove that in the Body of Christ the old man and the old creation of the redeemed people have already been fully terminated?
In order to have the reality of the Body of Christ, we must experience the termination of the old man and the old creation
Concerning this point, verse 4 says, 'One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling'
After they are saved, even as they comb their hair, there is One within them asking, 'Is it right to comb your hair in this way'?
How can we prove that in the Body of Christ the outward framework and the inward content are joined and mingled together to be one?
The union and mingling of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man produces a building of the living and walking together of God with man
The co-living and co-walking of these two spirits in the believers is the means for the building up of the Body of Christ
When two trees are grafted together it does not mean that one tree takes the place of the other tree and the other does not live any longer
We, the poor branches, are grafted into Christ to become the branches of Christ as the true vine , to live with Him and enjoy all His riches
From the beginning Brother Nee did not agree to translate the word Christian into Chinese as 'Christ-disciple'
The Lord Jesus is God who became a man, but He did not lose His divinity; He is still God, and hence, He is God yet man
Today we the saved ones are men who become God but we have not discarded our human nature we are still men and hence we are man yet God
If we have really seen this matter, there will always be a reminder within us: 'Would a son of God speak in this way?
The building up of the Body of Christ is through the co-living and co-walking of the two spirits in the believers
To grow up into the Head Christ in all things implies that in every point and every aspect of our daily life Christ is increasing within us
The members of Christ will grow by the growth of Christ and eventually arrive at the building up of the Body of Christ
We grow up into the Head, Christ; then we have something that is out from the Head for the building of His Body
Out from the Head, Christ, all the Body is also knit together through the operation in the measure of each one part
When the various parts of the Body operate appropriately, all the Body will be knit together, that is, interwoven
The Body of Christ can be built up by the joining and knitting together through the supplying joints and the various functioning parts
The growth of the Body of Christ is the increase of Christ in the many members, resulting in the Body of Christ building itself up
All those who are not in life, not walking according to the union of the two spirits, are not in the building up of the Body of Christ
The Body of Christ is absolutely not built up by using man's natural methods or the organization of human work
Today there are people who argue by saying that a local church is independent; a local church should not interfere with another local church
When You appeared to Abraham, he waited before You and walked with You, waiting for Your last word, until You had completed Your speaking
From 1933 to 1935 there was a publication among us that reported and fellowshipped concerning the situation of the churches
From Moses in the Old Testament until the apostle John in the New Testament, God spoke for more than fifteen hundred years
The last book of the Bible, Revelation, says at the end that no one should add to these words or take away from these words
Even before the first group of apostles passed away, the church had already veered from the word of God, the revelation of God
What they wrote also became a part of the truth, a part of the Bible, to be a warning to the future generations
After the first group of apostles, in church history there were the so-called church fathers, who defended the truths
A sentence that he spoke, 'God became man that man may become God,' shocked everyone, and it has become a famous quote in church history
Two centuries later, when the British Brethren were raised up by the Lord, they pointed out clearly that the Holy Spirit is a person
The English translations after the nineteenth century began gradually to adopt the personal pronoun He in referring to the Holy Spirit
God's eternal economy is something that today's theologians overlook, yet it is a very important truth in the New Testament
Although theologians today also speak of the Trinity, what they speak is not very impressive or complete and is not very scriptural
Although these new terms were not invented by us, because they are quite expressive and meaningful, we also use them
What the Lord has shown us in His recovery concerning the Divine Trinity is that the three coexist and coinhere
The Divine Trinity is for the dispensing of God into His chosen people that they may accomplish His eternal economy
We have been shown that the third major item in the divine revelation concerns the person and work of the all-inclusive Christ
The Spirit of God, after being compounded, transformed, and intensified, became the consummated Spirit of the Triune God
Generally, in the understanding of Christians, eternal life is not a life but a blessedness in the heavens to be enjoyed forever after death
The sixth major item of the divine revelation in the Bible concerns the Body of Christ, which is the church of God
On the other hand, it is the organic Body of Christ for Him to have a counterpart that is organically united with Him to be His expression
Now we come to the second aspect of the Lords recovery that is the Godman life which is the kind of living that the believers need to have
We have received the power of Christ's resurrection; hence, we can live a crucified life by this power, being conformed to His death
Not only so, when he was in prison, he lived and magnified Christ by enjoying the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
When Christ was crucified on the cross, He dealt with our old man, our flesh, and the involvements of the flesh sin, Satan, and the world
Not only so, in our living the God-man life, we must also overcome religion, culture, and the tide and amusements of this age
Romans 5:17 and 21 say that we who have received the abundance of grace should reign in life through this abundance of grace
The universal Body of Christ is the house of God, that is, the kingdom of God, appearing in various cities as local churches
The Bible shows us that one city should have only one church for the sake of keeping the oneness and preventing division
Deuteronomy 12518 clearly tells us that when the Israelites arrived in the good land they could not choose a place of worship as they liked
They needed to go to the place where God had placed His name, which was the place where God would build His dwelling place
Because Christianity is not willing to be restricted by one city having only one church, today's situation has become confused and divided
If each state issued its own currency, the entire United States would have to issue fifty kinds of notes, and the market would be in turmoil
If the highways in each state could not be connected, then the transportation in the entire country would be choked
In the Catholic Church today there is a hierarchy of the pope, the cardinals, the archbishops, the bishops, and the priests
They do not teach any doctrine that is unrelated to God's economy and has nothing to do with the testimony of Christ
The kingdom of God is the sphere in which God exercises His authority so that He may express His glory for the fulfillment of His purpose
In such a kingdom, what matters is not eating and drinking but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit
It characterizes the relationship that those who live in the kingdom of God should have with others and with God
In the Lord's recovery there are a few matters that are urgent at the present time to which we should pay special attention
We need to produce vital groups and endeavor to gain people to be members of the Body of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ
Every brother and sister in the Lord's recovery needs to pursue prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ
