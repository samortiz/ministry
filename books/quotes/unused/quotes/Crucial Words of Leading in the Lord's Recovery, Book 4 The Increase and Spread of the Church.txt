The matter of increase is related to a church locally, whereas the matter of spread involves the church's spreading out
In our translation of the Recovery Version of the New Testament, we always try to follow the sense of the meaning in the original text
In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said that when a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it bears much fruit
On the day of Pentecost Peter stood up with eleven disciples and gave a message and as a result three thousand people were led to salvation
Bible scholars and readers acknowledge that the book of Acts does not have an ending; it is continuing even now
If there were a written record of the continuing acts of the propagating disciples, we might have twenty-eight thousand chapters
In God's eyes, however, there have been only two men throughout the history of man: Adam is the first man and Christ is the second man
Corinthians 15:45 and 47 speak of the first man, Adam, who is out of the earth, and the second man, Christ, who is out of heaven
Any man who has been born after Christ but who has not believed into Christ is also only a part of the first man, Adam
Only those who have been born after Christ and who have believed in the Lord are part of the second man, Christ
Today Adam has been propagated to become a great kingdom; all the people living in the world are citizens of his kingdom
From Adam to Jesus there are seventy-seven generations, and from Jesus until now there have been many more generations
The Bible tells us that Adam was created in the region of Mesopotamia, which is in close geographic proximity to Europe, Asia, and Africa
If we are willing to die for Christ, forsake the world, and not care for anything, we will be the Lord's witnesses and His propagation
History tells us that mankind has progressively filled the earth through the footsteps of Christians preaching the gospel
The growth and development of politics, military affairs, culture, and trade all reflect the influence of Christian 'footsteps'
The preaching of the gospel by Christians to the uttermost part of the earth has resulted in the map of the world being continually redrawn
In light of the Lord's charge to increase and spread, we are negligent in responding to His commission because we are so set and settled
No other book in this world tells us that men should be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth; only God's Word tells us this
Sometimes Christians sigh when they compare the number of people in the world with the number of believers but we should not be disappointed
In the future the Lord will definitely open up the United States and Brazil, and eventually He will come Himself to take over the world
By 1956 this number increased to thirty-five to forty thousand, and close to half of these met in the church in Taipei
According to these cards, there were between fifteen and seventeen thousand saints in the church in Taipei in 1956
According to our record, in 1956 there were approximately three thousand people participating regularly in the church life
Of the saints who went abroad, only a few spread to the United States, and even fewer spread to other countries
Today it is very convenient to travel from one place to another not only from one place to another within Taiwan but also to other countries
We must ask whether the Lord has a similar feeling when there is such a need for the increase and spread of the church
Some English missionaries went there in the past, but not many people are willing to go there now to preach the gospel
At the same time a church has been raised up in northern Burma, and it has been in contact with the church in Bangkok, Thailand
We could not meet the need even if we sent three hundred saints to work in India and another hundred to work in Burma
Over the past twenty or more years, a church should have been established in every town on the island of Taiwan
We have no way to gospelize Taiwan, not to mention truthizing it, because there has not been enough propagation and increase
We bought some long wooden boards, placed some bricks on the ground, and put the boards on top for people to sit on
We have cared for ourselves but not for the Lord's testimony outside our locality; this is our greatest shortcoming
In reality, the increase and spread of the church are the increase and spread of Christ, because the church is Christ
It is only when we enter into God's economy by going out to work for His economy that we can enjoy the economical Spirit
If we continue to live a set and settled life, it will not be very easy to experience the outpouring of the economical Spirit
The spread of the Lord's propagation involves the believers meeting and announcing the gospel from house to house
When Philip went out to preach the gospel, the Lord's angel was with him, and the Lord's Spirit was also with him
Peter still looked for opportunities to travel and to preach even though he bore important responsibilities in Jerusalem
The spread of the Lord's propagation was advanced by the specific sending of the apostles for the work, as recorded in Acts 13:2-3
To further the spread of His propagation and because of the faithfulness of the apostles, God caused signs and wonders to accompany them
Rather, we need to believe that our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; He has died on the cross for our sins
To depend on the word of God's grace is to have the real growth in life through knowing the truth and by the grace of God
Since they could not continually work in any one place, the Epistles were a means of teaching and nurturing the believers in every place
Paul wrote the book of Galatians to render the proper teaching to the Galatian believers and to nurture them in the matter of life
Amidst his busy work however he was able to take care of the churches that he could not visit by writing Epistles to teach and nurture them
During his first imprisonment in Rome, Paul wrote four Epistles-Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Philemon
Regrettably, it seems that today we take care of only truth and life; we have not paid much attention to the increase and spread
In the first seven years of the Lord's recovery here, there were only four hundred saints, and there was insufficient coordination
In the previous chapter we pointed out that the knowledge of the truth and growth in life are for the church's increase and spread
In resurrection He produced much fruit, that is, many grains as the multiplication of Himself as the unique grain
The New Testament reveals that the only begotten Son of God became flesh, passed through human living, and died on the cross
Individually speaking, these grains are individual believers; collectively speaking, they are the one Body of Christ, the church
Christ is present on every continent of the whole earth, and the expression of this spreading Christ is the church
Bible readers throughout history acknowledge that the book of Acts has no conclusion; it is a book that transcends time and space
Perhaps God in the heavens today looks upon the continuing acts of His disciples as further chapters in the book of Acts
In chapter 21 when Paul went up to Jerusalem James said You observe brother how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed
In Acts Peter, Paul, and all the other saints continuously propagated Christ so that Christ could be increased and spread on the earth
Today in the twentieth century there are genuine Christians in every large city of every continent on the earth
When the Lord's recovery first came to Taiwan in 1948 and 1949, there were meetings in only three to five places
Thirty-five years later there are more than eighty churches; nevertheless, there are three hundred eighteen towns in Taiwan
In other words, we have spread only to one-quarter of the towns in Taiwan; three-quarters of the towns do not have the Lord's testimony
We also need to recover the saints who have not been meeting for a long time, even those with whom we have lost contact
We do not preach ourselves or philosophy, and even more, not ethics or theories; we preach and release the word of God
Acts does not contain a record concerning meetings in a chapel, but there is a record of meeting 'from house to house'
The means for Gods spread is through His Spirit by the prayer of the believers by the release of Gods word and through the believers homes
They testified not only by their words but also by their living; eventually, they testified even with their lives
Now we need to fellowship concerning the statistics of the church in Taipei and evaluate them in light of our condition
In this respect, the church in Taipei is a moving church; it is normal in many aspects, and it is full of vitality
Even when counting all the saints in the churches on the island, we still had a forty percent annual rate of increase
In the past thirty-five years more than fifty-seven thousand information cards have been filled out by saints in the church in Taipei
The actual number of regular attendees, those who were solidly in the church life, was about three thousand in Taipei in 1956
For many years the number of people attending the Lord's Day meeting in the church in Taipei has averaged about three thousand one hundred
On the most recent Lord's Day, however, there were about three thousand five hundred, an increase of four hundred
According to our observations, we have not lost contact with many as a result of moving, and at most, five thousand have emigrated
Just like a boat that is in a current, the church will either advance or be pushed back; the church must always advance'
Honestly speaking, the condition of the church in Taipei, whether in terms of the number of people or the meetings, is second to none
We must study why we had an annual rate of increase of one hundred percent from 1949 to 1956, but less than three percent since then
We all are responsible for this situation, but those of us who take the lead in the work must bear more of the responsibility
Today, regardless of whether one is operating a business, a government agency, or a school, there is always a set of accounts for each year
Once we began to look at the statistics, we discovered that our condition has not advanced much over the last twenty-eight years
The average life expectancy of a person in Taiwan is over seventy years, but our spiritual life expectancy may be less than seven years
We neglected our statistics and did not formulate a way to properly respond to the facts revealed by these statistics
Many years have passed with no change, and in looking back, we realize that we have gained very little increase
From 1949 to 1956, our average annual rate of increase was mainly attributable to the formation of small groups
We gained people through the preaching of the gospel, and we retained people by meeting with them in small groups
The co-workers and elders were busy every day for twenty-eight years, bringing in forty-five thousand people to be baptized
Regrettably, after 1956 we suffered a great loss after inviting a 'spiritual giant' to 'help' us, and our way of small groups was torn down
After 1956 the small groups ceased to function even though we did not officially announce that we would put aside the small groups
The purpose of my continuous talk about statistics is to help us understand the means and base for the increase and spread of Christ
In place of the small groups, there were big joint meetings, mass gatherings, and meetings involving one man speaking
One rarely sees the Catholic Church advertise a gospel gathering; their main method is personal contact and personal support
The Lord did not allow this to happen; He raised up a confrontation to deliver Paul out of this situation of confusion
The Lord delivered him not only from the rioting of the Jews but also from the mixture of Judaism with the New Testament church
At the most, it would have been able to provide a place for immediate neighbors; the capacity of a house is always small
Sadly, after 1956 the negative influence that we received caused us to neglect the practice of meeting in small groups in the homes
Now we must rise up in order to catch up, turning our attention away from joint meetings with individual speakers to the small groups
The co-workers and the elders have all agreed to divide the saints in the church in Taipei into about four hundred groups
In order for a country to be powerful and prosperous, the most essential component is the need for strong family units
In order for a country to be powerful and prosperous, another essential component is the need for a matching system of education
From now on we should stress both sides because everything needs two sides in order to go forward with balance
In other words, we must have small group meetings for home nurturing, and we must also have joint meetings to educate in the truth
In the past we relied only on joint meetings and neglected the nurturing in the homes; consequently, many people did not remain
In other words, without the 'family' units in the homes, our newborn children were not nurtured and could not grow
If the Lord blesses us in our pursuit of our vow to bring one person to the Lord in the coming year, we will double in number
In principle, the number of homes and the formation of small groups should increase proportionately to the increase in the number of people
Even if we have no 'schools' for higher education, we can provide a general education, even if it is at a high school level
These three verses show that the church life of the saints in Jerusalem was mainly in the homes; the homes were the base
Government organizations and large companies all have a business plan, but even a family or a single person should have a plan
Everything should be planned; we should not lack focus, expressing agreement with the church but returning home to sleep in peace
You can narrow it down to a few who could be saved and then make them your target, praying for them specifically
Since we all agree that the church should have an increase equal to one hundred percent, each of us should go home and make a proper plan
The Bible speaks of the believers as being branches of the vine; branches bear fruit as a matter of nature, not as a consequence of miracles
Although we have emphasized life over the past twenty-eight years, our annual rate of increase has been less than three percent
If a person desires to obtain the most benefit from his education, he needs to follow a schedule so that time is not wasted
Private education in China in the past typically involved one person teaching a group of children to recite ancient literature
Educational methods have changed, and now most countries follow a schedule that goes from kindergarten to graduate school
If we are busy with other things and do not have a scheduled time to read the Bible, we will not be able to find the time to read the Bible
If a person is not healthy, he must care for his body for the Lord's sake and set aside sufficient time for rest
Without a schedule we will read the Bible unceasingly when we are happy and put the Bible aside when we are not happy
Although we can excuse ourselves by saying that we have been busy, the real reason is that we have not set a schedule to manage our time
They rush to a meeting because they have no schedule, and then they linger long after a meeting because they have no schedule
We need to consider our use of time and make a schedule; otherwise, we will lose many opportunities to redeem the time
During winter and summer breaks many students do not rest according to a schedule; as a result, time flies away
If God's creation occurred in such a casual manner, how many days would it have taken Him to create all things?
He created according to a precise schedule of six days; moreover, these days were evenly divided into evening and morning
One of the primary requirements of the training is that people would be in their seats five minutes prior to the scheduled time of a meeting
The training surely has helped because often fewer than twenty, and sometimes no one, arrive late to a meeting now
If the earth did not orbit the sun according to a set schedule, it would be impossible to sustain life on earth
Young people often work unceasingly without rest, but when they are finished with their work, they want to sleep unceasingly
We need to read a set number of chapters or verses in the Bible at a set time in order to maintain this necessary spiritual practice
It is a mistake to rely on mood, and it is not enough to know about truth and life if we do not have a schedule for bearing fruit
A vine's fruit is not an issue of the mood of the vine, and neither is it the product of a spontaneous miracle
As members of the Body of Christ, our increase and propagation are also according to the law of the divine life
On the other hand, these times are affected by loosening the soil, watering, and adding fertilizer at set times
Consider a saint who is convinced that zealousness for the Lord involves constant participation in every activity of a local church
Her willingness to ignore the needs of her home, her children, and her husband also created problems for the Lord's testimony
When one brother, who could not attend every meeting, came to a meeting, he was asked, 'Why didn't you come to the prayer meeting?
At the same time, we should adjust our concept to realize that it is not abnormal if a saint can attend only one or two meetings a week
Over the last sixty years, it has been our practice for the Lord's table to be a joint meeting on the Lord's Day
The Lord's table meeting is the most important meeting of the church, and it is highly regarded by all believers
Breaking bread once a week on the Lord's Day in a joint meeting at the meeting hall is not required by the Bible
In other words, the bread-breaking meeting does not necessarily have to be held jointly at a meeting hall on the Lord's Day
There is a need for more fellowship and study, but we should not be inflexible, confining ourselves to an old way
We must study why forty thousand people have been baptized over the past twenty-eight years, but only five thousand meet regularly today
If the same tree or plant is moved to a place where there is little water and insufficient sunshine, it will not grow well
There are some plants that do not grow well in direct sunlight, and they must be planted in cool, shady places
We do not need to force them to come to the meetings, because our constant urgings may damage their desire to follow the Lord
Outwardly, it seemed that this was helpful, but actually we inhibited their growth, and they eventually died because of our overzealousness
Even though the annual rate of increase of the church in Taipei is not sufficient, we cannot have a uniform method for everything
Since the believers are branches, we abide in the Son and are one spirit with the Lord , thereby participating in His position and authority
We participate in the Lord's position and authority in His death, resurrection, and ascension because we are one with Him
By abiding in the Son, we receive the Father's nurturing, because the Father is the husbandman, the cultivator of the vine
The law of fruit-bearing does not involve miracles; this can be seen from the fact that fruit is not produced by miracles
There were miracles in Acts, but these miracles were related to outward confirmation, not to the producing of fruit
The supply of the Father is like soil that provides nutrients, and the supply of the Spirit is like rain that waters and refreshes
Finally, we need to abide in the Lord and live in the church as the garden of God so that we can be nurtured and protected
A large hall is like a university, a medium-sized hall is like a high school, and a small hall is like an elementary school
Otherwise, even though we continually beget those who can be nurtured in the homes, there will be no 'university' to teach and perfect them
In John 15:5 the Lord spoke of a law for the increase and propagation of the church, saying, 'I am the vine; you are the branches
Rather, a fruit tree grows leaves at a set time, sprouts buds at a set time, blossoms at a set time, and finally bears fruit at a set time
The Lord was conceived in Mary's womb and born nine months later according to the law of human life in God's creation
A table is not organic, because it is made with pieces of lifeless wood that are joined together by tenons, nails, and glue
Even though a dentist can make a set of dentures, every person's first teeth are the issue of the growth of life
Ephesians 256 tells us that we were crucified with Christ raised up together with Him and even seated together with Him in the heavenlies
Because we are in an organic union with Him, He and we, we and He, are joined as one in both position and authority
Today the Triune God is our essence, and the indwelling Spirit of life causes the Triune God to be realized in our experience
If there is too much fertilizer, a fruit tree will die, but if there is not enough fertilizer, the tree will not grow robustly
Similarly, if there is too much water, the tree will be damaged, but if there is not enough water, the tree will dry up and die
We need to pay particular attention to the environment for cultivation, which also includes factors such as sunlight and air
If all these factors work together properly, a tree will begin to bear fruit that will fully ripen in due time
Today we are branches of the true vine, the Lord, and we have made a vow before the Lord to lead people to salvation
Finally, we need to abide in the Lord and live in the church as the garden of God so that we can be nurtured and protected
We need to live in the church, just as a vine has to remain in the garden, in order to receive protection and care
People move from place to place, and when they move, they often come in contact with Christians who preach the gospel to them
Based on His plan, He created the heavens, the earth, and the things in the heavens and on the earth according to a schedule
Ephesians 5:15-17 confirms this point, saying, 'Walk, not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil
It may be seven o'clock when we are stirred from our sleep again, but because our back is sore, we decide that more sleep is needed
Finally, at nine o'clock we decide to get out of bed but only to drink some water, eat some breakfast, and read the newspaper
By the time we are finished with our breakfast activities it may be close to the time for a noon nap which will take up even more of our day
Since his classes start every morning at eight o'clock, he will use an alarm clock in order to not miss the bus that takes him to school
If a person works and rests according to a schedule, he can graduate from college even if he is not able to make the highest grades
If we are late to work every day, we will be dismissed, and if we want a good job evaluation, we have no choice but to follow a schedule
A person who does not follow a schedule will do poorly in school and probably will be unsuccessful in his career as well
We have all been saved, but we may never have heard a message about the need for a schedule in spiritual matters
All the brothers and sisters in Taipei should make a schedule based on a plan in order to have a new beginning in the church life
When considering morning revival, for example, we should not think that we need to set aside an hour and a half in order to be 'spiritual'
The church in Taipei has asked the saints to schedule ten minutes in the morning for morning revival; this is reasonable
In addition to the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord's Day and the prayer meeting, there are other meetings during the week
We should not be impulsive and go to meetings when we feel good, but stay at home when we feel cold toward the Lord
After this sister is married, she will have a husband and a house that require some attention, and soon she will probably also have children
If her husband is a brother in the Lord, then the sister should fellowship with him about her meeting schedule
It will not be difficult for each of these one thousand five hundred to lead one person to salvation each year
It will not be easy to achieve a one hundred percent increase based on the total number of saints in the church
The church in Taipei has been divided up into three hundred fifty small groups that have already started to meet
We should not be anxious about our plan, because the small groups will have a great impact on our increase and spread
Even now we can see some impact through the recovery of three to four hundred saints in just the past six to seven weeks
Please accept our suggestions and work out a schedule for a personal plan according to the simple ways listed below
You can seek the Lord's leading as to whom you should labor on first, and you can begin to pray over each name
You should allocate your time daily, weekly, and monthly according to the needs of your family and work responsibilities
In any case, an appropriate amount of time should be set aside specifically to contact people to preach the gospel
Based on our experience, it is best to set aside at least one hour every week in order to contact people to preach the gospel
You may not see any results in the first few months, but if you continue month after month, you will see results gradually
Under the Lord's leading, labor on them, pray for them, regularly call them, write to them, invite them to dinner, and visit them
Whenever there is a gospel meeting of the church or any gospel activity in your small group, invite them to attend
For over thirty years we have encouraged the brothers and sisters to exercise their spirit and to function in the meetings
Our meetings should be as comfortable as our home life because we have been in meetings together for many years, just like a family
We should not be unfamiliar with the things that we need to do in a meeting, such as exercising our spirit and functioning
Since we could not leave early, we suffered through this time, looking at our watches and waiting for the meeting to be dismissed
God can accomplish whatever He desires to accomplish; He does not need to practice, because He does not need to learn
Many of us have been meeting regularly for many years, but we are like a basketball team that is not well coordinated
The leading brothers should not create ordinances but rather lead the saints to know the flesh and the natural man
Christianity regulates people so that they will not be disorderly, but the church must emphasize spirit and life
When eight or ten saints gather together, everyone is a leading one with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities
In the small groups there are no religious rituals or set practices such as first singing a hymn and then praying
During the time in a small group gathering, the sisters should forget that they are sisters and remember that they are members
At other times, when the gathering is concluded, it is good for the sisters to remember that they are sisters and not be so bold
When seven or eight brothers and sisters gather as a small group, there is time for fellowship about many matters
In the church the brothers and sisters must know one another, bear difficulties together, and share in joy together
If we gather in groups for six months, we will feel the sweetness of the small group and enjoy an intimate supply from one another
In order to express our love, it is easy to serve delicacies and to eat lavishly, but this can easily offend the Lord
The food should be prepared in a simple, clean, refreshing, and hygienic manner so that people do not become sick
Since those in a small group have much contact with one another, it is inevitable that the saints will become close
In order to prevent this from happening, we should not allow worldliness and socializing to creep into the gatherings
Every small group must be open to every other small group, welcoming and embracing the brothers and sisters in the other groups
Instead of designating the coming together of a small group as a meeting, it would be more appropriate and accurate to call it a gathering
For the sake of convenience, a brother or sister must be able to attend any small group according to the Lord's leading
If we do not attend a small group because there is a brother or sister whom we dislike in the group, this is the flesh
If we choose to join a group that has a spiritual giant rather than a group composed of seemingly ordinary saints we will gain very little
In following the Lord's leading, we should not feel as if we are restricted to fellowshipping with only one group
Choices based on preferences and the flesh violate a spiritual law, and once a spiritual law is violated, there can be no blessing
The small groups are not religious organizations; therefore, no responsible ones should be assigned to take the lead
Under normal circumstances, the grace that one has at the time of the gathering is the source of the group's leading
According to grace and fact, there will always be a leader, but this leading will not be based on a position or title
Everyone should be a leader in a small group because everyone has the same obligation and same opportunity to supply others
Even though these practices are not sinful, they kill the spirit within the believers and virtually annul their organic function
A considerable number of believers wait for a meeting to begin, but the Bible does not tell us when a meeting should begin
Although we have set a time to gather together, there is nothing wrong with coming early and beginning to pray
We need to be flexible in the time of our group gatherings; otherwise, some saints may be shut outside the door
We need to cast off the old ways that we have been following for decades, and the best way to cast them off is to gather in small groups
They chatted as they ate, and a newly saved sister was stumbled and no longer wanted to gather with the small group
There is no place for vain talk or personal friendships in a small group and even our fellowship should not be based on personal attachments
Every small group must be open to the other groups in a local church welcoming and accepting brothers and sisters from any other small group
In addition, the saints in a small group should not exclude other brothers and sisters or compete with other small groups
In order for a country to be strong, there is the need for strong family units because only strong families can produce strong young people
Christianity has been on the earth for over nineteen hundred years, and its way of meeting has changed over time
At that time, approximately one hundred saints began to meet; at the end of the year approximately nine hundred saints were meeting
The nature of a joint meeting is related to teaching, whereas the nature of a small group gathering is related to nurturing
By analogy, a newborn child needs a place where he can be nourished, cherished, and supported in order to survive
If there are only big meetings and no small group gatherings, it will be difficult to care for the saints who are young, sick, or weak
We should duplicate and distribute these cards to all the districts so that the brothers and sisters can make enquiries
These 'missing' ones are our spiritual children, our brothers and sisters; it is worth our effort to locate them
We have heard many testimonies that the dormant saints, who have been recovered by the small groups, are very seeking
A small group should preach the gospel to the relatives, friends, and neighbors of the saints who are gathered together
Today a majority of Christians do not know the content of the apostles' teaching, and even fewer know of the apostles' fellowship
Acts 2:42 says, 'They continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers'
According to common rules of grammar, when objects are listed in sequence, a conjunction can be added after each object
Luke wrote in a different way in Acts, separating the four items into two groups using the conjunction and twice
Before the Brethren, no one, not even the church fathers, could explain the significance of the wording in Acts 2:42
He said that the teaching and the fellowship are of the apostles, whereas the breaking of bread and the prayers are not
He appointed twelve apostles, who then preached what the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit revealed to them-Christ and the church
In Christ God was manifested in the flesh passed through human living crucifixion death and resurrection to become the lifegiving Spirit
The twenty-seven books of the New Testament speak of God's New Testament economy; the teaching of the apostles also speaks of God's economy
Some of us were in Christianity for many years and never heard the pure word concerning God's New Testament economy
The speaking of the apostles was centered on Christ and the church-Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
In the Lords recovery today particularly when gathering as a small group we must speak concerning the economy of GodChrist and the church
Today Christianity is full of confusion, and there are many methods of biblical interpretation, some of which are not trustworthy
In the Lord's recovery we need to return to the Bible and speak only the apostles' teaching, which is God's New Testament economy
If we speak concerning such things as head covering, baptism, or speaking in tongues, there will be endless disputes
Even though there are many benefits in forming a small group, there is also the potential problem of opening a door
Before the nineteenth century no one saw this light, but when the Brethren were raised up in England, they saw the light and released it
At the Lord's table, on the one hand, we enjoy the Lord, and on the other hand, we offer up our adoration to Him
The Chinese speak of 'reverence and love,' but reverence before love is religious, whereas loving and honoring are experiential
When we are saturated with God's love, there is a response in us of love toward Him, and then out of this love, honor and respect come forth
A small group should pray, petitioning the Lord related to the needs of the saints and the church and for the carrying out of God's will
We should preach the gospel beginning with our family, then to our friends and neighbors, and then to all those whom we know
Paul lived in Ephesus for three years, and he not only taught the saints publicly but also from house to house
After learning the truth and bringing the young goats to a gathering, there is a need to nourish and teach them
We should learn to exercise the spirit when we gather; we do not need to wait for certain brothers to arrive before starting the meeting
Our gatherings also do not depend on religious rituals, such as singing and praying at the beginning of the meeting
Brother A could say, 'God's creation of man was wonderful,' and Brother B could ask, 'In what way was it wonderful'?
Brother A could answer, 'There was a consideration, a conference, within the Godhead concerning the creation of man
If a meeting was conducted in this way, no one would fall asleep, and Genesis 1:26 would be in our hearts forever
A brother could be asked to memorize and recite Genesis 1:1: 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'
Another person could be asked to memorize and recite verse 26: 'God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness'
Although the Bible is in print and in their hands, Christians see nothing of God's revelation when they read the Bible
In many heathen religions, people are required to worship by kneeling down and prostrating themselves before idols
If we read the Bible according to the inspiration of the Spirit in a meeting, the supply that others receive will not be forgotten
After reading a verse in a living way, a simple prayer can be offered, a hymn can be called, and even a testimony can be given
After singing or reading the Bible, some may be inspired to give testimonies, and others may follow with another hymn
Under the influence of both Christianity and our natural man, it is very easy to fall into rituals rather than to exercise our spirit
We should exercise to be in spirit because there are no rituals in our spirit there are only the riches of Christ with all of His freshness
While those who are stronger should bear responsibility, there is no need to assign anyone to be a responsible one or a leading one
Because the Lord is working in the environment, many saints who have not been meeting for a long time have returned
Although we rejoice in this, it is important that we immediately bear the responsibility to approach and contact them
As long as we care for him in the spirit, fellowship with him, and are concerned for him, he will receive our care and protection
During one meeting the names of these two brothers were mentioned, but some did not feel that the time was right to visit them
Several weeks later the names of these two brothers were mentioned again, and this time there was a feeling to visit them
Even an elderly sister, who has been saved for many years and who also loves the Lord dearly, can function to supply others with grace
We need to believe that the Lord's grace is with us, and we must rise up to faithfully and diligently to offer our portion
If we all function in the small groups, our small groups will ignite the city of Taipei just like a spark of fire burns through a meadow
Once we rise up in spirit, we will not care for outward ways or practices that can cause us to deviate, to be opinionated, and to be divided
We desire to be fully in the spirit, to love the Lord, to love the church, to love people, and to love the brothers and sisters
Whomever we touch will be enlivened, whomever we meet will be blessed, and whomever is in our thoughts will be waiting for us when we visit
When Saul of Tarsus was saved, no one dared to believe that he could be saved because he had persecuted the Lord's church so severely
We all should learn to kindle a fire in the group and also to kindle a fire in order that every brother and sister can be burning
Thessalonians 514 says We exhort you brothers Admonish the disorderly console the fainthearted sustain the weak be longsuffering toward all
Even though he was quite good in preaching the gospel, the character in his living was rather disturbing to others
If we have a quick disposition, desiring quick results, we need the Lord's mercy so that we will be persistent in our prayers
Even if the brothers and sisters we are caring for do not meet our expectations, being anxious concerning them will be of no benefit
Of course, we also should not be stubborn, pressing him to be burning when it is obvious that he is not open to be burning
We should bring these matters to our fellowship with the Lord so that we can gain a proper sense of His burden and timing
After speaking for three years, the Americans said, 'All those in the church life in the United States speak Mr
Several years ago in an institutional publication of a renowned American evangelist there was an article that even used the term prayreading
If group after group is up to the standard, it will be similar to a strong nation with good families and good citizens
When one group after another is raised up in the church, every believer will be strong, and the church will be strong
He may arrange an environment to bring us to other cities or may even impart a burden to spread to other countries
Once the Lord's Spirit has the freedom to move, the Lord will release His riches and fulfill His heart's desire
According to the number of those attending meetings, there are less than ten thousand people on the whole island meeting with us
While these testimonies are good, the small groups should do more than specialize in recovering dormant saints
If we start counting from the summer of 1950, the Lord's recovery has been in Taiwan for the past thirty-five years
Recently, we counted the information cards for the church in Taipei, and there was a total of more than fifty-eight thousand forms
These ninety thousand saints are scattered among Taiwan's eighteen million people, like drops of water in a great lake
The church in Taipei has more than fifty-eight thousand information cards, but not more than five or six thousand people meet regularly
When we preached the gospel and baptized new believers in the past twenty-eight years, we did not have a proper way to retain them
If half of the fifty-eight thousand people had remained in the church life, the churches would have a completely different look today
In order to recover the dormant saints we must cooperate with the churches to locate and bring back those for whom we have information cards
All the churches on the island need to use the information cards to recover the saints, making an effort to seek them out one by one
In the same way, many will be able to read about the current situation in the churches in Taiwan, and they will be encouraged
We not only need to sustain and retain our existing saints and recover dormant saints, we also need to preach the gospel
Retaining existing ones, recovering dormant ones, and preaching the gospel are three things that small groups should do at the same time
In Greek the word fellowship conveys the meaning of flowing, being in agreement, linking up, and communicating
Once a lamp is connected to the electrical current, it is connected not only to the power plant but also to other lamps
When we are gathered into the Lords name we have the position to say Lord You must be in our midst because this is Your word in Matthew 1820
If there are two thousand six hundred eighty, we should add the Lord Jesus and report two thousand six hundred eighty-one
Each time we come to a gathering, it is not to conduct business, not to eat hot pot, and not to make friends or seek assistance
When the brother finishes speaking we should not merely nod our head and smile thinking that this testimony is good but not saying anything
A young sister may offer a prayer: 'O Lord, may You give us grace so that, like this brother, we can all grow in life'
The two-way traffic in fellowship is similar to pickled vegetables, which stimulate one's appetite during a meal
After half an hour of fellowship, everyone will be full and satisfied, and when they part, they will yearn for the next meeting
Since we have not been adequately trained and lack exercise and practice, we are accustomed to attending worship 'services' and sitting
Once the teachers arrived, they led us to Sunday school to sit in small pews and then to the big chapel to sit in large pews
Of course, it is also possible to turn a practice of not going to the podium to sing hymns and to read the Word into a religious ritual
We need to exercise our spirit because there are many situations in the small groups that can never be handled by applying regulations
Perhaps He may give someone the leading to say Those of us who know this hymn can sing together and those of us who do not know it can learn
From this fellowship we can know a brother's situation, problems, and burdens so that everyone can intercede and share the burden
It is rare when there are no prayers, because we have a spirit that needs to breathe, and prayer is our breathing
In large meetings in Christianity arrangements are made beforehand to have Pastor Soandso call a hymn and Doctor Soandso lead the prayer
We can speak about many points in the Bible, but our focus must be on the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen people
We should never say that people in a group gathering will not understand our speaking related to God's New Testament economy
Man was created by God with three parts, and even though man has a mind and a body, he also has a spirit to contact God
If we have such an exercise every morning, we will definitely have a supply for others in the group gatherings
Line by line and point by point, they all speak concerning God's economy, which is God's desire to dispense Himself into His chosen people
If we are willing to make the effort to obtain the material from these books, we will be faithful ministers of the word
The Bible speaks of 'the unsearchable riches of Christ' and 'the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ'
We must learn to speak concerning things such as these, which are related to God's New Testament economy, and not speak different teachings
Even an ordinary electrician has greater knowledge about electrical lights than Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb
Lord, we are still very poor in our knowledge of You, in our knowing of Your Word, and in our entering into the light in Your word
We need to have a new understanding of the administration of the church, because it concerns our household administration
The economy of God has two aspects: an inward aspect as it relates to life and an outward aspect as it relates to administration
Every man has a body for outward activities, but he also has an inward constitution related to his spirit and soul
Although the genuineness of the church rests on the inward aspect of life, there is a need for the aspect of outward administration
It is easy to deviate from the economy of God if we speak of the church only in purely spiritual terms while neglecting its administration
Consequently, the economy of God includes both the outward aspect of administration as well as the inward aspect of life
The local churches rank second with about forty-five thousand, and the True Jesus Church ranks third with about twenty thousand
Regrettably, this information also shows that we have gained spirits and souls but not many bodies over the past twenty-eight years
In our effort to be spiritual, we have nurtured our spirit so that it could be strong, but our body is very weak
If we had paid more attention to this matter in just the last fifteen years, our situation would be vastly different
As a result, close to one hundred thousand 'drops of water' are no longer in our bucket; that is, they no longer meet with us
Currently, brothers and sisters who meet with us are working in every level of society and in every Taiwanese institution; this is good
If they responded by naming a certain district, he knew that they were our brothers and sisters, our family members
We need to know how the administration of the elders and the service of the deacons can be coordinated with the development of these gifts
When we read it, we can pick up a point here and another point there, but we must put them together in order to see something
If the elderly saints are attentive, their mind will become more focused, and these points will be easily remembered
Although an elderly person may be slow in understanding, once something enters into his memory, it will not easily be forgotten
Corinthians 12:28 says, 'God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then
Just as the eldership is an office, the deaconship is also an office, each having particular responsibilities and functions
The second category, which includes helps and administrations, is related to the administration of church affairs
These three gifts-apostles, prophets, and teachers-supply truth and life, although there are differences in their various functions
Offices function in the aspect of administration, which is related solely to overseeing and leading the church
In terms of office, there are apostles and then elders and deacons, and in terms of gift, there are apostles and then prophets and teachers
Prophets and teachers are gifts to the local churches for the release of the revelation of God and the supply of the mystery of the truth
A prophet is inspired by the Spirit and receives revelation from God; hence, the word that is released is a revelation
The teachings of a teacher are mainly for the defining of doctrine, such as the truth related to justification by faith and sanctification
The elders teaching is in the pattern of parents teaching and the teaching in a meeting is more in the pattern of a schoolteachers teaching
Although he seems to be able to teach the saints in one locality, he has difficulty teaching saints in another locality
Anyone who has the genuine gift of teaching will be able to teach wherever he goes because teaching is his profession
A person can have some knowledge of mathematics, history, and geography, but this does not qualify him to be a teacher
When the elders teach, their teaching should be like the guidance of a parent who is teaching his children at home
Some elders are good at administrating the general affairs of the church, and others labor in word and teaching
Those who function as a prophet or teacher should endeavor to develop their spiritual capacity so that the church can increase and spread
The elders need to endeavor to coordinate with the gifts for the propagation in their administration of the general affairs of the church
Since the small groups provide an environment for everyone to exercise his or her talents, the gifts of many saints will be manifested
Within a very short time a small group will double and become two small groups, and the number of people will increase
It is the responsibility of the elders to take care of matters such as purchasing land, planning, and drawing up the budget
As the small groups multiply and develop, the saints will increasingly speak of the need for additional meeting halls
The elders cannot be negligent in this matter; they should be like a 'Combined Logistics Team' that supplies the needs of the military
The Combined Logistics Team needs to be aware of the situation and be swift to respond to the needs of the advancing military forces
In relation to general affairs, there is the need for local administration in order to respond to various practical needs
If the elders notice that a certain small group is not on the track of God's New Testament economy, they should both oversee and intervene
They should be careful to not restrict or kill the proper move and propagation of the gifts either intentionally or unintentionally
The elders must keep their eyes wide open, their view must be broadened, and they must quickly purchase land and build a bigger meeting hall
We should be clear concerning gifts and offices: In terms of gifts there are first apostles, second prophets, and third teachers
When we carry out our responsibilities in an orderly way, the church will spread step by step, and the Lord will have a way to go forward
Lord, when we see so many brothers and sisters meeting every day, we know that You are doing a work of grace in our heart
Lord Jesus, we exalt Your name, call on Your name, extol Your name, and praise Your name, which is above every name
Even the building of the tabernacle at the base of the mountain was not an individual work but a corporate work, the work of the assembly
Even though there were many Israelites, there was only one pillar of cloud by day and one pillar of fire by night
The children of Israel were a corporate people, not scattered individuals, and their entire living was a meeting life
The number of the Lord's believers became three thousand one hundred twenty, and they immediately started to live a meeting life
Verse 44 says, 'All those who believed were together,' and verse 47 says, 'The Lord added together day by day those who were being saved'
Verse 43 shows that when they gathered together, the authority of God was with them, and fear was upon every soul
If women were added to this number, surely there must have been ten thousand, all of whom were living a corporate life, a meeting life
According to the Bible, the meeting life of the early church involved large, joint gatherings and smaller gatherings from house to house
In the joint gatherings we teach and speak the truth in the Word of God concerning God's New Testament economy
Through His process, the Triune God has released the divine life and can impart the divine life into us to become our life and nature
Individually we are sons of God, and corporately we are members of the Body of Christ, the house of God with a corporate meeting life
Our experiences tell us that it does not take long to sense that something is wrong when we fail to gather with the saints
If we thoroughly learn these twenty-seven books, we will be clear concerning the truth revealed in the Old Testament
Revelation, the last book in terms of its position and its completion, is a 'sealed' book to Christians all over the earth
We must enter into the book of Revelation, because the New Testament is open to us, and God desires to show us His complete revelation
Reading the genealogy in the first seventeen verses of chapter 1 made it difficult to continue to read the Gospel of Matthew
Since 1974 we have conducted bi-annual trainings in the United States to release messages on every book in the New Testament
As long as a person reads the footnotes and the Life-study messages, all the riches we have received will be displayed before his eyes
The whole set of the Life-study of the Bible has approximately one thousand two hundred messages, and each message is about ten pages long
If you are willing to spend eight hours a day for pursuing, you will be able to read the New Testament very thoroughly in two years
The number of people who can gather in a home is usually not very large, and it is always sweet to get together
Since the number of people in a small group gathering is small, the nature of the meeting should be to nurture the saints
Rather than emphasizing the truth the focus should be on nourishing fellowshipping shepherding supporting caring and bearing one another
The first kind supplies life by releasing the truth, and the second kind teaches the truth by expounding the Bible
The first aspect of education can be accomplished by nourishing the saints with a life message at least once a week
All these matters should not be carried out in a hurried atmosphere so that every saint will receive help, light, and the life supply
Over the past few years, we have presented the truth using new terms, such as the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit
As long as we have the heart to study the messages, progressing in a proper order, we will be able to finish them
Although the hare was fast and the tortoise was slow, the hare lost the race because it did not run methodically
Since the truth in each topic is interrelated, fifty-two lessons will enable us to understand more than one hundred topics
After careful consideration before the Lord, we feel that it is more suitable for this meeting to be on Thursday night
The apostles were teaching the truth every day, and the saved ones were being taught and thereby lived in the teaching of the apostles
Acts 242 speaks of the breaking of bread and prayers and verse 46 says that the believers practiced breaking bread from house to house
A combined gathering would have about twenty to thirty people and it would not be too difficult to hold the meeting in a saints living room
The breaking of bread can be on both a smaller scale in the small group gatherings and on a larger scale in the district halls
During this meeting, one thousand six hundred saints gathered together to break bread on the Lord's Day evening
Although it is not possible to have a large Lord's table meeting every Lord's Day, we should have one at least once a month
Hopefully, the church in Taipei will build a meeting hall that can hold ten thousand people and that has the best sound system
On the first Lord's Day of every month, the saints should come together in the district meeting halls to break the bread
On the other Lords Days in the month four or five small groups depending on the number of people should gather in their homes to break bread
They should be held in small groups throughout the year so that people will not have to go to the meeting halls
Strictly speaking, every brother and sister, whether strong or weak, progressing or backsliding, should preach the gospel in their home
Sometimes the wife can preach the gospel, the husband can give a testimony, and the children can strengthen the words of their parents
Some recently recovered saints, who used to be unwilling to meet, are taking the lead in this kind of family gospel meeting
Although these are meetings of the church, they may be a burden to saints who are newly saved or recently recovered
If he can attend a small group gathering every week, his inner man will be nourished, and he will gradually be strengthened
After attending these two meetings for a period of time, he will ask about meetings related to the release of the truth
Some may come once a year, others may come twice a year, and still others may come three or four times a year or once every month
We should not have any 'laws' that kill people, and we cannot forsake our fifty thousand dormant brothers and sisters
When we first arrived in Taiwan, we did not have an atmosphere of preaching the gospel, studying the truth, and pursuing the growth in life
America is a strong and prosperous country because many of its governmental systems are based on principles found in the Bible
The concept of democracy practiced in America is rooted in principles spoken of in both the Old and New Testaments
In the Old Testament God commanded Moses to tell the Israelites not to rule over their brothers with severity so as to annul their rights
After God's people entered the good land of Canaan, God allotted a portion of land to each tribe and to each family, each household
When the jubilee arrived every fifty years, a trumpet was sounded , and the land sold to another Israelite would no longer belong to him
The Bible does not say that the land was returned to the original owner; rather, it says that 'each of you shall return to his possession'
Both he and his master instantly became equal before God, and the man who sold his land could return to his dwelling and possession
Even when the Israelites left Egypt and followed Moses, they moved according to the blowing of silver trumpets
In their journey with Moses, they never stayed in one place very long because a long encampment would cause them to be slothful
The Lord Jesus , the twelve disciples , the seventy disciples , and the one hundred twenty disciples stirred up an atmosphere
We were not superstitious, thinking that with prayer alone the wind would blow and carry our tracts to every household
We placed these posters at train stations, bus stations, crossroads, important intersections, and on the front doors of the saints' homes
Gospel teams were first used in Shanghai, and we often had more than eight hundred on a team that would march through Shanghai
When the team reached the Bund, a major downtown district in Shanghai, we would shout with a loud voice, 'Oh, Shanghai!
With lanterns in their hands, the teams would go through the streets and small alleys shouting slogans, such as 'Repent'!
Another team would leave from hall one on the Lord's Day afternoon, divide into four groups, and walk toward New Park
Every Lord's Day we would go to New Park to preach the gospel, and in the afternoon we would come back with four to five hundred names
We also had a meeting every Monday evening for saints who were burdened to visit the ones who had given us their names
When we first started the work in Taiwan, we had only a few hundred brothers and sisters, but we very quickly increased to tens of thousands
During this initial stage, we would share from Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, and eventually we began to release life-study messages
Metrical form; that is, the words in each stanza are in two lines of eight syllables and one line of six syllables, which are repeated twice
These are our family members, but our care for them is so lacking that we do not even know where they are living
Stir up an atmosphere among us so that we would receive a burden to take Your heart as our heart and to take Your love as our love
May the indwelling Spirit cause them to have a renewed feeling; light the lamp within them, sweep them, and seek them
We call on You, Lord, for mercy and grace; manifest Your works; use the outward environment and the inward sense to touch these ones
Stir not only in us but also in them, just as You worked in Peter and in Cornelius so that there would be a response on both sides
Thank You for a situation that is so suitable for the work of the gospel and for the building up of the church
The first move of the church must be to recover the saints who have not been meeting and those with whom we have lost contact
If we would do this thoroughly by the Lord's grace, we could recover two-thirds of them within two to three years
If thirty thousand saints are recovered, this will greatly strengthen the testimony and service of the church in Taipei
In order to recover these brothers and sisters, our initial plan is to thoroughly examine the existing information cards
We need to begin by recovering the brothers and sisters who seldom attend meetings but whose whereabouts are known
The key to recovering these saints is for the brothers and sisters who regularly meet in the small groups to receive a burden
We have to believe that our concern matches the Lord's concern on the throne; in fact, His concern has touched us to be concerned for others
A teacher may teach boxing in the classroom in one way but when it comes to the actual boxing match the teachers instructions may not work
Consequently the most important matter in visiting is to have a praying and learning spirit saying O Lord only You can restore this one
Since the one we are visiting will have some sense of shame related to not being in the meetings there is no need to remind him of this fact
We must not urge them to come back to the meeting or chastise them for not being in the meetings saying It is not good to miss the meetings
A testimony should not be a pretext to preach, to beat, or even to chastise the dormant saints for not loving the Lord
Even saying, 'I am really concerned for you,' will only make some secretly wonder whether our concern is only based on their weakness
We do not need to say so much; rather, we should join in with what they are speaking, following their topic in sincerity
He would come again a week later with the same approach; he would not speak much, but he would have a smiling face
When we go to visit the saints, it is often better not to speak than to speak, and if we have to speak, we should not speak too much
There were about one thousand in the meeting, and as soon as the singing of the hymns began, many were subdued
Many times our words are not appropriate and because we do not know their inner condition it is easy to hurt them and cause them to feel bad
We must have a spirit to lay these dormant saints on our shoulders like lambs and bring them back to the church
When the son came to himself and thought about returning home, he considered the words of repentance that he would speak to his father
Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry, because this son of mine was dead and lives again'
As our brothers and sisters return, our hearts must be filled with love for them, and we must minister Christ to them
Even if the dormant saints want to bring up their past, we must let them know that it is not necessary, because of the Lord's grace
As our brothers and sisters return, we can minister what we have experienced and enjoyed of Christ according to the need
When we see the expression announcing the gospel, our inner being leaps because, as believers, we have a gospel-preaching life in us
The more we preach the gospel, the stronger our inner being becomes and the more feeling we have for the gospel
Through the building up of small groups, the saints have more opportunities to fellowship and pray with one another
When we look around, we still see many relatives, friends, and neighbors who are unbelievers, and we surely have some feeling for them
The more we try to merely maintain what we have, the more we will lose it; the more we try to keep it, the more it will leak away
The more we go out, the more active our inner man will become, and the more we go out, the more we will have the Lord's word
Every new face, regardless of whether it is weak or even opposing, fills the brothers and sisters with a fresh burden
Before a new one comes, the direction of the meeting may be uncertain, but once he arrives, the direction and utterance become clear
We should not have the concept that only preachers and missionaries can be witnesses of the Lord; we all are the Lord's witnesses
A brother may think that he cannot do anything if he is not an apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd-teacher, elder, or deacon
When we hear about preaching the gospel, we often make many excuses, such as saying that we are not eloquent or gifted
If we have not seen anything, we would not be in the church; if we have not seen anything, we would not come to the church meetings
We can testify of the Lord by speaking one sentence or one message; in the eyes of the Lord there is no difference
Acts 1:8 tells us that our witnessing should be 'in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth'
When it comes to preaching the gospel, many of us are willing to go to far-away places, but we are unwilling to go to nearby places
The gospel can be preached in this way in a big meeting, but intense speaking in a small group often scares people off
There were only about ten brothers and sisters in the small group and two gospel friends, so his attempt to 'draw in the net' was awkward
With a sense of desperation, the brother even asked the two gospel friends to kneel down to pray in front of everyone
We should encourage the brothers and sisters in the small groups to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel
When they go to a church meeting and see older saints who have been following the Lord a long time, they often do not speak
The members of the small groups should pick up a burden to encourage each other to preach the gospel by themselves in their homes
When we eat at a good restaurant, we may eat the best delicacies, but we do not have much of an intimate and warm feeling
In some groups there are brothers and sisters who are not very strong and who do not often come to other meetings
As the time approaches, he may lack confidence in his ability to speak so he may ask his wife to listen to what he is going to speak
After speaking in this way, he may realize that his words need to be supported with some verses, so he will look up some related references
Those who preach the gospel in their homes will not only bring unbelievers to salvation but will also be blessed themselves
We can fellowship with the saints in our group about the details concerning the gospel preaching times in the homes
Since our gospel contacts are also our relatives, friends, and neighbors, we can invite them to come to more than just one meeting
There are no preachers in a small group gathering because there is no need for a preacher; rather, everyone can testify
The wife may say something as well, testifying how her husband's disposition changed completely after he believed in the Lord
If the children are a little older and are clear about their salvation, we can even ask them to give their testimonies
In this way, before the testimonies are finished, our gospel friends will be completely subdued and open to the Lord
After giving a testimony, a brief word on the gospel can be given, but it does not have to be a lengthy discourse
The members of the household should strengthen the meeting with personal testimonies of their salvation and with some speaking on the gospel
Many of today's young people will not agree with the gospel when they first hear it; they always have some questions
Many times young people have questions and by allowing them the freedom to ask, their problems can be resolved
We ask the Lord to gospelize Taiwan, but we have little way to determine whether or not the Lord has heard our prayers
If we pray specifically for our relatives and friends one by one, we will pay attention to whether or not the Lord has heard our prayers
It is a great strengthening to our faith when we see a person turn and believe in the Lord after praying for him for many months
In their initial zeal some brothers and sisters write down a hundred names and make a determination to pray for them every day
If three thousand saints are willing to distribute one gospel tract every day, three thousand tracts would be handed out every day
Although the gospel is very common today, we still know that many people have never heard about the Lord Jesus
In today's society people believe many things that are not true, because they are constantly repeated and spread
We have many gospel hymns, and we should learn them one by one so that we can sing and declare them all the time
Today we have things that people did not have thirty years ago, such as tape recorders and other audio devices
If every saint is faithful before the Lord and willing to gain at least one person each year, our numbers will certainly increase
