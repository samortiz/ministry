[1]  The Exercise of Our Spirit for the Release of the Spirit CONTENTS
[2]  We must realize that the relationship between God and us is a relationship in the spirit because the Spirit of God dwells in our spirit, works together with our spirit, and is even joined and mingled together with our spirit.
[3]  Romans 8:16 says that the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit, and 1 Corinthians 6:17 tells us that we are one spirit with the Lord.
[4]  We often pray for the Lord to work, saying, Lord, we are waiting for You to work, but we do not realize that He is waiting for us to cooperate with Him.
[5]  Our problem today is not with teaching or knowledge but with the exercise of our spirit.
[6]  How often during the day do we exercise our spirit to release the Holy Spirit?
[7]  We know how to exercise our arms and legs, but we do not know how to exercise and use our spirit.
[8]  However, when we pray, we often exercise our mind instead of exercising our spirit.
[9]  Thus, in order to exercise our spirit, we must forget all our thoughts and outward circumstances and take care of our inner sense.
[10]  If we do not take up this responsibility, it is meaningless for us to come together, because the purpose of our coming together is to exercise our spirit that the Spirit would be released and that the Lord would be exalted, magnified, exhibited, and glorified.
[11]  Question: Should we use our mind to think before we begin to pray?
[12]  Answer: Many times when we go to the Lord, we are thinking.
[13]  When we go to the Lord, we must forget about everything and simply go to Him to contact and deal with Him in a real way.
[14]  Then when we come to the meetings, we must be active, positive, and living, and our spirit must be released.
[15]  When we commit a sin, we immediately sense that we are wrong, but when we bring death into the meetings, we do not have the same sense.
[16]  In this message we would like to see something regarding the flow of the Spirit and the exercise of our spirit in Psalm 45.
[17]  We may sing songs in the meetings when we are with others, but we will not sing songs when we are by ourselves, because such songs can be sung only in the spirit.
[18]  The most significant matter regarding Christ in this psalm is the sweet smell of His death and resurrection, and the most significant matter regarding the church in this psalm is the singing and praising typified by the harpstrings in Psalm 45:8.
[19]  When we are not in the spirit, it is not easy to sing, but when we are in the spirit, it is easy, and the more we sing, the more we are in the spirit.
[20]  We must exercise our spirit which has been mingled with the Holy Spirit so that we may realize the death and resurrection of Christ, having the sweet smell of His resurrection and His golden nature wrought into us.
[21]  The only way for the whole church to be in the divine nature and full of God is to exercise our spirit, and the best way for us to exercise our spirit is to sing praises to the Lord and to overflow with singing.
[22]  If we exercise our spirit, the Lord will be liberated because the Lord today is in our spirit as the Spirit.
[23]  CHAPTER THREE NOT QUENCHING THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:16-19 THE BURNING OF THE SPIRIT
[24]  We not only must pray but also thank the Lord, praise Him, and rejoice in Him.
[25]  When we take the cover off the chimney by opening our mouth to rejoice, we cause the Spirit to burn.
[26]  CHAPTER FOUR EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO EXPRESS GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 4:6; 5:18b-20 GOD S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN
[27]  Ephesians 4:6 says, One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
[28]  The way we can express and manifest God is by opening and releasing our spirit.
[29]  If we release our spirit, the very God who is in our spirit will automatically be released because He has committed Himself to our spirit.
[30]  When we come together to meet, we may know how to exercise our mouth, but we do not know how to exercise our spirit.
[31]  My only burden is that the Lord would impress us that as Christians who are seeking the Lord, we must realize the secret and mystery of our relationship with the Lord, which is the matter of the exercise of our spirit.
