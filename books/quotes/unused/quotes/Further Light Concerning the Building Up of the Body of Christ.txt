Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for Your sovereignty and for Your sovereign grace so that we could have this conference
Thank You, Lord Jesus, that where the sprinkling of the blood is, there is the anointing of the all-inclusive Spirit
The fact that all may learn and all be encouraged also shows that this is not predicting but speaking for the Lord
The enjoyment of Christ firstly issues in the growth in life to produce materials for the building up of the church
Our hope is that all of us will be transformed into the precious materials for God's building by enjoying Christ
The enjoyment of Christ issues not only in the growth in life but also in the development of gifts for functioning
In these three chapters, Paul gives a clear view of the development of spiritual gifts for functioning to build up the Body of Christ
Dispensing Christ by speaking Him, prophesying, is the top development of the gifts as an issue of enjoying Him
Corinthians is a book of enjoying Christ, but what is the reason for us to enjoy Christ, and what is the issue of enjoying Christ?
Our enjoyment of Christ is also for developing our gifts to speak for Christ to build up the Body of Christ organically
If all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all'-v
Speaking in tongues, even if it is genuine and proper, only edifies the speaker himself, but prophesying builds up the church
He indicated to the saints in Corinth that they had to be limited in their speaking in tongues and increased in their speaking for the Lord
If everyone pushes, one day the traditional way of one man speaking and the rest listening will be pushed away
What the Lord wants is to have all the saints, including the sisters and all the young people, to speak for the Lord, to prophesy
Brother Nee saw this fifty years ago, but we never fully entered into the practice of it because we had no way
Brother Nee told us that we had nothing to replace the kind of meeting in which one person is speaking and the rest are listening
Although they have not become Christians yet, the thought of one man speaking and the rest listening is already in them
If twenty out of fifty saints meeting together speak forth the Lord to exhibit the riches of Christ, that meeting will be a rich feast
One cannot buy a piano and simply begin to play it immediately without any instruction, perfecting, or learning
To speak for Christ, to speak Christ forth, to speak Christ into others, is to practice a function that excels
When we meet together to enjoy the speaking of God in His oracle, the earth is connected to heaven, and the heaven is open to the earth
When we receive His speaking, we are enlightened, nourished, strengthened, established, transformed, and built up
In such an encouraging chapter, Paul tells us in verse 26 that whenever we come together, we should speak Christ
Someone can say, 'This very Jesus, who is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, is now the indwelling Spirit'
After that is said, another one can say, 'He is the consummation of God as the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God'
What a meeting we could have if all the attendants would speak nothing but Jesus in the many aspects of His person!
In Matthew 24:35 the Lord said, 'The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away'
It would be good to have the following saying framed on our wall: 1 Corinthians 14:26 to be fulfilled definitely
In Paul's talk with the elders in Ephesus in Acts 20, Paul said that he taught them 'publicly and from house to house'
Our concept of an apostle may be that he is a good speaker who is eloquent, knowledgeable, and highly appraised and exalted
Many of these saints tried repeatedly to have Brother Nee in their homes, but he would not accept their invitations
He did not shrink from declaring to them anything that was profitable , declaring to them all the counsel of God
In the Summer Training of 1987 in Anaheim California we went out to preach the gospel and baptized about three thousand seven hundred people
The Lord Jesus was charging us to go to the lower class people in the hedges to compel them to enter into the kingdom of God
After they enter into the kingdom of God, we need to visit them again and again in their homes in order to perfect them
Paul stayed in Ephesus for three years to touch many homes of the saints after the elders had already been established
How could a mother who gave birth to some children, keep her hands off her children once they have been born, leaving them as orphans?
If the apostles keep their hands off the churches and the elders, the saints cannot be perfected and the Body cannot be built up
My concern is that it might be that a number of the elders in the Lord's recovery are taking the lead in the churches in a probing way
At the end of 1942, a great revival broke forth in Chefoo as a result of my staying with the church there for this period of time
In his Epistle to the Galatians, he unveiled Christ to the saints and labored on them that Christ might be formed in them
Paul ministered Christ and His unsearchable riches to the saints in his writing, especially in Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians
The church in Taipei has experienced the Lord's blessing as a result of their taking this way, the scriptural way of meeting and serving
, they have one hundred six district meetings, and the total number of regular attendants is four thousand five hundred
About one-third of this number have learned to speak the Lord to one another with short messages of about three minutes
Every Lord's Day morning about fifteen hundred people speak Christ to one another, to the angels, and to the demons and the Devil
As a result of taking the new way, there are now two hundred fifty-three churches in South America; over two hundred of them are in Brazil
The writers of the New Testament talked about Christ, but they spoke concerning Christ from different angles and not in the same way
These three writers of the synoptic Gospels did not teach the same thing concerning Christ as John did in his Gospel
Many of the saints however have not been perfected to the extent that they can discern what is true and profitable in the writings of others
The members of the Body of Christ are all organically related to one another in life and enjoy the one fellowship of the Spirit
The teaching of the gifted persons listed in Ephesians 4:11 must be the teaching according to God's New Testament economy
These gifted persons teach the saints to do the work of the New Testament ministry that is to build up the Body of Christ in the organic way
The professors in a college need to stay in their school at least two or three times a week in order to take care of their classes
The ones among us who have learned to speak the Lord as prophets should stay in a certain church to perfect the saints
Sometimes he may instruct the saints in a small group, and sometimes he may tutor certain saints, that is, help one saint at a time
Proverbs 4:18 says, 'The path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day'
The Chinese expression for afternoon means going down from noon, while the Chinese expression for morning means going up to noon
Every morning we should experience Christ as the rising sun to be revived by Him, and all day long we should live Christ
A prophet would fellowship with the saints, showing them these things of the Lord by his experience and through the study of the Word of God
He would instruct the saints how to compose a short message that they could speak in the meetings for about three minutes
If we help the saints practice in this way for about one year, most of them will be good prophets and their speaking will enrich the meeting
If there are a hundred fifty saints meeting together, after half a year the attendance may go down to a hundred five
The number of meeting ones in the churches goes down and down because the meetings are poor and full of emptiness
It is hard to maintain the number of people in the meetings with one man's speaking, unless he is quite learned and eloquent
Some may ask, 'Who are the apostles among us, who are the prophets, who are the evangelists, and who are the shepherd-teachers'?
Each one of us needs to be perfected by the four kinds of professors gifted personsapostles prophets evangelists and shepherds and teachers
To prophesy is not mainly to predict, but rather to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, to speak the Lord into others
When you talk about something other than Christ, you do not feel ashamed, but when you talk about Jesus, you may have a feeling of shame
To play the piano properly, one must concentrate his entire being and be under strict instruction with much practice
Ephesians 4 says that Christ as the ascended Head has given many gifts, many gifted persons, for the perfecting of the saints
Not only the big shoulders are gifts to our physical bodies but also our little fingers are given to our physical bodies as gifts
The practice of traditional Christianity, however, does not give all the members of the Body of Christ an opportunity to function
Since not everyone is capable of singing properly, they feel that they must have some who have the talent of singing
We must learn one thing-whatever we do in the meeting, we must do it with our spirit and with Christ as the content
Even though we cannot carry a tune, if we sing in the spirit with Christ as the content, this singing is sweet to the Triune God
The meeting in the congregational way seldom touches your life; it seldom touches what you are; it seldom touches your very being
The practice of building up the Body of Christ is absolutely different from the traditional way of Christianity
In the scriptural way of meeting without any outward attraction, the speaking, singing, praying, and praising touch our being
He will feel that he has no place to get more growth in life, to have some fellowship, to get the supply, and to supply others
You are able to discern that the ones who meet in the congregational way may only know how to participate in outward and social things
You have the inner feeling and sensation that these are your brothers, the members of the Body of Christ on this earth
Regardless of how wonderful a person's messages are, the congregation may eventually get tired of his speaking
When a husband comes home from a meeting in which he does not speak, he may tell his wife that the meeting was not so good
What is needed for the building up of the Body of Christ is for us to minister or to dispense Christ into others
In the first verse he says, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy'
The saints need to be perfected by the gifted persons to speak Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ
We may not be qualified to perfect the saints as an evangelist because we do not have such a gospel-preaching spirit
We found out that the most effective way to gain people for the Lord is to visit them in their homes by knocking on their doors
In the training we taught the saints the proper technique so that people would be open to letting them in their homes
The building up of the Body of Christ by the perfected saints is under the gifted persons' perfecting and is done directly
Ephesians 4:16 says that the Body will build itself up in love because all the members build up the Body of Christ
We should learn how to be apostles, how to be prophets, how to be evangelists, and how to be shepherd-teachers
They will practice speaking Christ daily and at the end of each week they will have prepared something to offer in the larger church meeting
If the co-workers and elders endeavor to practice this new light, they will develop the ability to teach others
The faith refers to what we believe in, which is mainly the redemptive work of Christ, the completed work of Christ
In between the subject 'all the Body' and the predicate 'causes' there is a long adjective phrase that modifies 'all the Body'
The predicate causes is modified by three prepositional phrases that act as adverbs out from whom unto the building up of itself and in love
The sentence could read this way: 'All the Body, out from the Head, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love'
Through the supply of the joints and the operation of each one part in its measure, the entire Body is joined together and knit together
Ephesians 4:16 is the unique verse in the Bible that tells us how the organic Body of Christ can be practically built up in the organic way
The Lord told Peter that he was blessed because flesh and blood had not revealed this to him but His Father in the heavens
He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the purpose of perfecting the saints
Even the gifted persons, the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, do not build the church directly
Ephesians 4:16 is the unique verse in the Bible that shows us how the organic Body of Christ is directly and practically built up
Based upon this revelation, we can say that the traditional way of meeting and serving in Christianity is absolutely wrong
We must see that the Body of Christ is built directly neither by the Head nor by the gifted persons but by all the members
The Body of Christ is built up organically by each member directly, but these members can do very little without being perfected
Ephesians 4 tells us clearly that the Head gives the gifts-the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers
Paul did a marvelous job of perfecting the saints, and he provided a pattern for us of the way a gifted member should live and work
Nee told us in his book Church Affairs that to have the traditional meeting on Sunday morning is according to the custom of the nations
Brother Nee also told us that it is hard to take away the habit of meeting in the way of one person speaking and the rest listening
The traditional way of meeting and serving annuls the functions of the members of Christ and does not develop the members
The Head has given the gifts, but regrettably many of the gifts have been abused to build up a big congregation, a big facade for a show
A congregation may be built up, but what members have been perfected to do the direct building of the Body of Christ?
He perfected the saints by teaching everything concerning God and His economy publicly and from house to house with tears
The reason it may not work is that after getting people baptized, they are not cared for adequately and properly
If a mother delivers a child and then neglects the child without giving him the proper care, can that child live?
If we baptize someone and then go visit him twice a week with much prayer and labor, this new one can be nourished, raised up, and perfected
We baptized thousands and thousands of people in Taipei, but we found out that it is not so easy to raise them up
The saints there are in the transition from the old way to the new way to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26 by Ephesians 4:11-16
They are in the experience of the Body causing the growth of the Body unto a direct building up of itself in love
The gifted persons should not speak to build up a congregation as a facade in order to make a name for themselves
If a person labors by visiting the homes of the saints, in a sense he will be unknown because he does not display himself
There will not be a facade of a large congregation because the church will be scattered in all the small homes of the saints
In order to be perfected, we must grow not in our natural life but in the divine life, in the life of God which is Christ
Because everything is vanity, the Apostle Paul said that he counted all things as refuse that he might gain Christ
Finally, we have to hold to the church, the Body of Christ, an organism , as the fullness of Christ to be His expression
Many Christians do not grow in life because they do not know how to hold to these true things, but we need to know how
By holding to these true things in love, we grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things, both small and great things
When we have more of Christ wrought into us and interwoven into our being, we are growing in Christ and with Christ
Babes cannot discern what teachings distract them from God's central purpose and what teachings are according to God's New Testament economy
For the protection of the babes, a mother always chooses the proper food so that her child will be healthy and will not be poisoned
Every building has a structure, a frame, and all the parts of this frame, this structure, are joined together to be one system
If this building is not realized in my time on this earth, at least this fellowship is in print for future generations
The Body is built directly by all the members of Christ functioning, each in his own measure, mainly in prophesying-speaking for the Lord
We need to practice the fellowship in this book so that we can see the reality of such an organic building on this earth
Lord we thank You for Yourself we thank You for being a Spirit we thank You for Your living word and we thank You for this present message
Some of us can testify that we enjoy the real, practical, and genuine speaking of God to us morning by morning
We may have heard God's speaking and received God's word, but can we speak something from the Bible in the way of new light?
For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory'
Some of us may be able to answer this question based upon the help that we have received from the Life-study of 1 Corinthians
If we do not have the light, all we can say is that this ministry is the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness
If any of the saints in the Lords recovery would say that he has been listening to a man this saint is the most foolish person on this earth
If we listen to a fallen man as a fallen descendant of Adam, this is surely a sin we have to confess and repent for
We need to consider the main, new revelations that we have seen in the past twenty-five years through God's oracle
We never saw the real significance and the vital importance of calling on the Lord until the Lord's recovery came to the United States
Another revelation that we have seen is the dispensing of the processed Triune God into the transformed, tripartite man
Each one of the main, new revelations that we have seen in the past twenty-five years is the Word of God in the new light
We need to see the truth concerning the unique ministry of God's New Testament economy and many personal ministries
In Brazil and the rest of South America in 1980, there were only forty-eight churches with about one thousand saints
In 1986 ten thousand people were saved and baptized in Brazil through gospel preaching by visiting people in their homes
The church in Manila was the first church established in the Philippines in 1930 on the northern island of Luzon
In 1986 twelve more churches were raised up, in 987 twenty-four churches were added, and in 1988 there was an increase of fifty-one churches
After the saints began to practice the new way, the number of churches on the island increased by ninety-two within four years
Thank the Lord for the increase and spread of the churches in the Philippines as the brothers there follow the Lord's up-to-date move
Brother Lee visited Korea in November of 1988 and thirty-two hundred saints gathered together for meetings with him
They completed the translation of many important books of the ministry along with the entire set of Life-study Messages within five years
In Seoul the brothers are dealing with about forty-two major Christian bookstores and about eight other bookstores in the rest of Korea
The church in Taipei has also enjoyed the Lord's blessing by following His up-to-date move to build up the Body of Christ
The attendance of the meetings in hall sixteen remained at about one hundred saints for fifteen years until November of 1987
The brothers are very much encouraged to stand one with the Lord's up-to-date speaking and to continue in the Lord's new way
A leading brother from the church in Chicago testified of the importance of the training in the Lord's new way
