<P>The traditional and even the basic theology concerning God's divine trinity does not have the view that the divine Trinity is for God to dispense Himself into us. This light has come to us only in the last thirty years.</P><P>Ephesians chapter one gives us a record of how the Triune God blesses His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people in His divine trinity. This chapter is mainly on the three steps of God's blessing us in His divine trinity, that is, on how He blesses us in the Father (vv. 3-6), in the Son (vv. 7-12), and in the Spirit (vv. 13-14). Eventually, because of such a flow of the divine Trinity as the blessing to God's chosen people, there is an issue, and the issue of this blessed flow is the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (vv. 22-23). The church as the Body of Christ is the total issue of the divine Trinity as a flow to dispense all that God is into His chosen people. The Body of Christ is the fullness, the totality, of the One who fills all in all.</P><P>Like Numbers, Revelation, the last book of the Bible, is also a book of numbers. This is true in a particular way concerning the description of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem has twelve gates with the names of the twelve tribes (21:12), and twelve foundations with the names of the twelve apostles (v. 14). Furthermore, the tree of life bears twelve kinds of fruit (22:2). Among these twelves the Triune God is hidden, and even mingled, as His people's blessing.</P><P>The consummation of the record of the entire Bible is God the triune as the very particular and subjective blessing to His people. As the consummation of the entire record of the Bible, the New Jerusalem is just the very God in His divine trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;wrapped up in the number twelve with His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people as their blessing. This blessing will last eternally. Such a blessing is the ultimate fulfillment of God's blessing to Israel in Numbers 6. Only when the New Jerusalem comes, will this blessing be completely fulfilled.</P><P>In the blessing in Numbers 6, "Jehovah bless you and keep you" (v. 24) is ascribed to the Father; "Jehovah make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you" (v. 25) is ascribed to the Son; and "Jehovah lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace" (v. 26) is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. The Father blesses us, the Son shines upon us, and the Holy Spirit lifts up His countenance upon us. As a result, we are kept, we receive grace, and we have peace.</P><P>Most of the Epistles of Paul open with a word concerning grace and peace. Grace is of the Son and peace is of the Spirit. Grace is somewhat objective. Peace is subjective; it is the result, the issue, of our enjoyment of grace. First we receive grace and then we enjoy peace. We receive grace in the Son and we enjoy peace in the Spirit.</P><P>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace (John 1:1, 14). Of His fullness we have all received grace upon grace (John 1:16). Whereas the law was given through Moses, grace came through Jesus Christ (John 1:17). This grace is actually a person, Christ Himself. When we receive grace, the result is that we have peace. This peace is the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit becoming the Spirit of peace within us.</P><P>The blessing in Numbers 6 is neither an Old Testament blessing nor a New Testament blessing. Rather, it is the eternal blessing of the Triune God, which is the Triune God dispensing Himself in His divine trinity into us for our enjoyment. This is God's eternal blessing.</P><P>"Jehovah bless you" means that Jehovah gives Himself to you. However, God does not give Himself to us merely in an objective way like one brother giving a gift to another. God gives Himself to us in His trinity, step by step and little by little. If you were to ask me what blessing I have received from the Lord, I would answer, "The only blessing I have received from the Lord is my Triune God. My Triune God is my blessing."</P>
