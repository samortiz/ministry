   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REDEMPTION AND SALVATION BEING FOR GOD'S DESIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO WORK HIMSELF IN CHRIST INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the common understanding and view among Christians, God gave Christ to be our Redeemer and our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He died for our sins, accomplishing redemption; He rose up from among the dead; and He has become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, this does not tell us what God wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God wants to work Himself in Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Redemption and salvation are for this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ's incarnation, Christ's human living, Christ's death and resurrection they all are for God's desire to work Himself in Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything that Christ is and everything that Christ has accomplished are for this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the steps, big and small, that God takes in our daily life are to fulfill His intention of building Himself in Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE PROPHECY THAT GOD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>WOULD BUILD A HOUSE FOR THE MAN</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>WHO WAS ACCORDING TO HIS HEART</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 2 Samuel 7:2 David, a man according to God's heart, said, "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that David felt that he should do something for God, that he should build a house for God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God reacted by saying to David through Nathan the prophet, "Will it be you who builds Me a house to dwell in?" v. 5 . God went on to reveal to David, through a prophecy in typology, that His intention was not that David would build a house for Him but that He would build Himself into David.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, God told David that He would make him a house v. 11b . Then He said, "I will raise up your seed after you..and I will establish his kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is he who will build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I will be his Father, and he will be My son" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>12-14a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here God revealed to David something concerning building, a matter that had not been revealed to either Job or Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The prophecy in typology in 2 Samuel 7 is related to the prophecy in Isaiah 11:1, which tells us that a twig will come forth from the stem of Jesse and that a branch from his roots will bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The house of David, which was a flourishing tree at Solomon's time, eventually was reduced to a stump consisting mainly of Joseph and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Out of that stump the child Jesus came forth as a twig, a sprout.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That was God's building a house for David, and through this house God gave David a seed Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, the prophecy given to David in the way of typology was fulfilled in Christ's incarnation and human living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is the seed that is the issue of God's building a house for David.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CHRIST'S SOWING HIMSELF AS THE SEED</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>INTO US AS THE SOIL FOR GOD'S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Matthew 13 reveals that Christ has sown Himself as the seed into us as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is the seed, and we are the soil with the nutrients for the growth of the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ in resurrection, Christ as the life-giving Spirit, has sown Himself into us not simply to stay in us but to grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The growth of Christ in us equals the building.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Christ who has sown Himself into us is now doing a particular work in us the work of making His home in our inner being, in our hearts Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is building, and it is carried out through the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a building is mentioned in John 14:23: "If anyone loves Me,..My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This abode is not only for the Triune God but is also for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, it is a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This thought regarding the building is strengthened in 1 Corinthians and in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1 Corinthians 3:10 Paul says, "According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation Christ , and another builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But let each man take heed how he builds upon it."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then he goes on to speak of building "upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble" v. 12 . Revelation 3:12 tells us that Christ will make the overcomer a pillar in the temple of God, which is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, the New Jerusalem, the consummation of the building, a composition of the Old Testament saints and the New Testament believers 21:12-14 , will be the wife of the Lamb, Christ, and a mutual abode for God and His redeemed for eternity vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>2-3, 9 .</S>
