   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE NINETY-THREE THE LAMPSTAND 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 25:31-40; 40:4, 24-25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we consider more detailed points concerning the lampstand, it will be helpful to have a general view of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Exodus 25:31 says, And you shall make a lampstand of pure gold; of beaten work shall the lampstand be made: its base and its shaft; its cups, its knobs, and its blossoming buds shall be from it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And there shall be six branches going out from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from its one side, and three branches of the lampstand from its other side.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The lampstand consists of a base, a stalk, and three pairs of branches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There were three branches on each side of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Underneath each pair of branches there was a knob holding the two branches at the stalk.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then on each branch there were three cups shaped like almond blossoms with knobs and blossoming buds.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that each cup was composed of two layers: a bottom layer, called the knob, or the calyx, the leafy green bottom of the blossom, and a top layer of petals, which actually made up the blossom, the flower.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The bottom layer is called the knob, and the top layer is called the blossoming bud.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The whole flower, including calyx and blossom, is a cup shaped like an almond blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we consider the lampstand as a whole, we shall see that on it there are twenty-five knobs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are three on each branch, three holding one pair of branches each, and four on the shaft of the lampstand, making a total of twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the three knobs which each hold one pair of branches do not have blossoms, the lampstand has a total of twenty-two blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The divine thought here is that the lampstand is actually a tree with calyxes and blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have a general view of the entire lampstand, we shall realize that it does in fact look like a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, the lampstand is described in such a way as to give the idea of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These verses speak of branches, buds, and almond blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Blossoming indicates growth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we must be impressed that the lampstand is a growing tree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a tree, the lampstand has certain outstanding features.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, it is a golden tree.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gold signifies the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we pointed out in the previous message, the golden lampstand is the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Triune God is a living tree, growing, budding, and blossoming.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have seen that this golden tree has many almond blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In typology almonds signify resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Aaron s rod budding with almonds signifies resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the almonds on the lampstand indicate that it is a tree in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Resurrection is life that overcomes death without being damaged or injured by death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Death is powerless to do anything with resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Death can inflict all kinds of damage on other forms of life, plant life, animal life, and human life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only one kind of life cannot be hurt by death, and this is resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Resurrection is life which passes through death and can never be held by it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the full revelation of the Scriptures, God Himself is this resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The lampstand, of course, gives light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the first significance of the lampstand is not light, but life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The light is at the top of the lampstand and underneath this shining light are the blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The lampstand is something that grows.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The calyx under each pair of branches indicates the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These branches are produced by the growing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, with the lampstand we see the branching out of life which takes place under the shining of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Life grows out light and blossoms with light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that the light is actually the blossoming of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we grow and blossom, the light shines.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our blossoming is our shining.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We grow with life, but we blossom out light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus far, we have seen that with the lampstand we have the divine nature, resurrection, life, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The seven lamps on the lampstand v. 37 signify the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, with the lampstand there are five crucial matters: the divine nature, resurrection, life, the Spirit, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The revelation in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, corresponds to the lampstand in these five matters the divine nature, resurrection, life, the Spirit, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now we must see that as those who believe in Christ, we are a part of this wonderful tree.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Realizing that I am part of this golden tree causes me to be beside myself with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise the Lord that we are parts of this tree in resurrection and with the divine nature, life, the Spirit, and the shining light!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The lampstand in Exodus 25 signifies the Triune God embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The lampstand in Zechariah 4 signifies the Triune God expressed in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Finally, in Revelation we have the lampstand reproduced and multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In both Exodus 25 and Zechariah 4 we have just one lampstand, but in Revelation 1 we have seven.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The one lampstand has been reproduced to become seven lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These seven lampstands are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because the lampstand has become the church and because we are all parts of the church, we have the ground to say that we are parts of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have the boldness to testify that I am a part of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I hope that all the saints can declare this marvelous fact.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do you not have the divine nature?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do you not also have resurrection, life, the Spirit, and the shining light?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As true believers in Christ, we have all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have seen that the lampstand is a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is not an entity without light, and neither is it inanimate.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is living, organic, and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is a tree-stand, a stand that grows like a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This living tree is growing, branching, budding, and blossoming.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As we have pointed out, the blossoming is the shining of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thus, the light is the life blossoming.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Actually the light is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>John 1:1 and 4 say, In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God....In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the shining of Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The fact that the lampstand is golden signifies that, as the embodiment of God, Christ is altogether divine.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But two aspects of the lampstand point to the humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>First, the central stalk of the lampstand has four blossoms, whereas each branch has just three blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the Bible the number four is not composed of two plus two; rather, it is composed of three plus one or one plus three.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The number three signifies both the Triune God and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Actually, as we have mentioned, the Triune God is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, according to the Bible, the number three signifies the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The number four in the Bible signifies creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>For example, we have the four living creatures and the four winds.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Thus, the number four signifies creation.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As God, Christ is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But as a man, He is a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Some Christians may protest when they are told that Christ is both the Creator and a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But the Bible definitely says that Christ put on human nature, that He had a body with flesh, blood, and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Are these not the elements of a creature?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Furthermore, Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In the lampstand we have not only the Triune God, but also the creature, as signified by the number four.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is the first aspect of the lampstand which points to Christ s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The second aspect of the lampstand related to the humanity of Christ is the wick.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The wick was made of fibers, primarily of cotton.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When the lamps on the stand were lighted, the wick burned with the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Every morning it was necessary for the priests to trim the lamps, that is, to snuff the charred, burnt wick.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The charred portion of the wick is called snuff.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The word snuff is also a verb meaning to cut off the burnt part of the wick.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Exodus 25:38 speaks of the snuffers and the snuff dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The snuffers were used to cut the wick, and the snuff dishes were used to contain the burnt part of the wick.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When the priest trimmed the lamps every morning, he cut off the charred wick and also added fresh oil.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This was the priests work in caring for the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The wick was the only part of the lampstand that was not made of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Thus, the wick signifies not divinity but humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Furthermore, the fact that the wick could become charred indicates that the lampstand not only signifies Christ Himself, but also us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Christ s humanity could never produce a charred wick.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Only our humanity is capable of becoming burnt and charred.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Surely Christ had no need of a snuffer to trim Him, to deal with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>As we read the four Gospels, we realize that it was never necessary for Christ to be snuffed, for there was never a charred wick in His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>However, we easily become charred and need to be snuffed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Morning watch is an excellent time to experience the Lord s trimming, His snuffing.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I can testify that this trimming takes place as I make confession to the Lord and ask Him to forgive me of all my defects, failures, weaknesses, and wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If we consider our situation each day, we shall see that there is always some charred wick that needs to be snuffed.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Our humanity is very low compared to Christ s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>His humanity never produces any snuff, but ours produces snuff every day and requires a daily trimming.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Thus, in our experience we need the snuffers and the snuff dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Perhaps you are wondering who performs this work of trimming, or snuffing.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Often Christ Himself will snuff us during times of fellowship with Him in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>At other times He may use an elder or one of the saints to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Furthermore, the ministers of the Word also snuff the saints and trim them.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If you are a Christian who is growing and maturing in the Lord, you will unconsciously snuff others as you have fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Some have told me that, during the course of fellowship, they have been snuffed by me.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Of course, I had no intention of trimming anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>This happened unconsciously and unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>For example, one brother told me that something I said in fellowship helped him with respect to a problem he had with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>He told me that this cutting, this snuffing, was very helpful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Many Christians today are not shining because they have a long, charred wick.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Their charred wick is smoking rather than shining.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>In some cases, the wick may be more than twelve inches long!</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>In order to shine properly and adequately, we need the snuffing.</S>
