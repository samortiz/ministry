Because of Your presence, we are full of faith that You are working here. Lord, we confess our weakness, smallness, and even uselessness. We need Your mercy. Your mercy is our trust. Lord, cleanse us fully. We need Your cleansing within and without. Thank You for Your cleansing blood and for Your anointing oil. Lord, speak to each one of us. Give each one of us a word, a word that You want us to have tonight. Lord, we thank and praise You for the blood, the anointing, and the sanctifying word. O Lord Jesus, open all of us up from deep within, and may we open up to You. Lord, may there be nothing whatsoever hidden or veiled within us, and may we not shrink back and hide from Your face. We do wish to see You face to face. May Your countenance, which is Your lovely face, become our help. Lord, we have followed You for years. Your presence has always been with us. Tonight, we need Your presence with us even more. Touch the deepest part of our being. Lord, You are our Head. We worship You here. We want to know You more, and we want to know more concerning Your organic Body. We also want to know ourselves and all the members more thoroughly so that we can enter into the consciousness of Your Body and maintain a proper relationship not only with You but also with all the members in Your Body. Lord, we can never forget Your evil enemy. You know that he is following us. Where You work, he is also busy. Lord, we pray that You would bind him. We also bind him in Your victorious name. We believe that whatsoever we bind here has been bound by You in heaven. Lord, bind Your enemy. You have promised that You will put him under our feet. May this word be fulfilled among us tonight. Clear out everything in us that has the poison and the bite of the serpent so that he can be trampled out of us. Lord, release Your word, so that all of us would receive Your boundless supply. Visit us once again so that we would have more of Your glory within and would express more of Your magnificence without. Amen.<h2 class=head1>SEEING THE ONENESS AND ARRIVING AT THE ONE ACCORD</h2><p>About a year has past since I was last here. I am so happy to see the brothers again. I wish to have some further intimate and thorough fellowship with all of you. After reading all the verses and the outline of this message, I believe you should have some impression that what I am sharing with you tonight is of two points: one is the oneness, and the other is the one accord. The oneness may seem high and far away in the heavens. But the one accord is very near and is even right here. It describes the condition within us. The term one accord speaks of something related to our mind.<p>According to the examples in the New Testament, oneness is very objective. It seems far away in heaven and hard to attain. But the one accord is very subjective; it speaks directly of our condition. For this reason, we can say that the one accord is the oneness in practice. The oneness without the one accord is only something on paper and has no reality to it. If we only speak of oneness without speaking about the one accord, we may have only some high and great doctrines. They may be good, but they are not practical. However, if we add the one accord to the oneness, we are &#8220;pulling the oneness down close to us,&#8221; like pulling a kite down from the sky. This will bring the oneness right to where we are. If we have the one accord, we will have the oneness among us in practice. Hence, we must first talk about the oneness, and then the practice of oneness, which is the one accord.<p>For quite a long time, I have been bothered as I considered our situation. Not only among those outside of us, but even among us the oneness and the one accord have suffered a great loss. The oneness has been neglected, and the one accord has been set aside. This has been our overall condition. For this reason, I have been constantly burdened within and have always wanted to come back to see all of you. I feel that our present need is to see the oneness, to emphasize it, and to dive into the significance of the oneness in an intensified way. At the same time, we should fellowship about the oneness in a serious way. In particular, we must arrive at the one accord. Without the one accord, there is no oneness. At most, there is the talk about oneness; there is no practicality of this oneness.<p>For this reason we have to thoroughly see the oneness spoken of in the Bible. The world talks about oneness also. As long as there is an organization, there is talk about oneness. A family wants to be one. A school wants to be one. In an institution or an army, people talk about oneness. Even in a community, or a little club, the same is true. What then is the difference between the oneness spoken of in the Bible and the oneness the world talks about? The oneness the Bible talks about is very different from the oneness the world talks about. It is even different from the oneness we may be used to talking about. The term &#8220;oneness&#8221; is the same for these different peoples, but its nature and ingredient are different. This is like the example of a ring; a platinum ring is of one nature, a gold ring is of another nature, and a brass ring is yet of another nature. The shape may be quite similar, but their natures are absolutely different. We can say that the oneness we talked about in the past did not touch the intrinsic nature of the oneness spoken of in the Bible.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Oneness and the One Accord according to the Lord's Aspiration and the Body Life and Service according to His Pleasure &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
