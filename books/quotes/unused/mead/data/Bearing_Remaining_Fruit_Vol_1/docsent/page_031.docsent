   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING ONE LEADING WITH ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Over the years, we have seen the danger brought about by opinions in various localities.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this reason we have held several trainings to present again the truth of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We believe that the truth is unalterable, like the multiplication tables in mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Two times two is four; no one can change it at will to be more or less.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The numbers are fixed and cannot be altered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Likewise, as long as the truth is presented, it will prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not allow any room for opinions in our training.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you have opinions, please do not come to the training.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you cannot drop your opinions in the training, we would ask you to withdraw.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we hold on to our opinions, the training will be a waste of effort; the opinions and the effort will offset one other.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The truth that we speak and the instructions that we give have all undergone a long period of research and study.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We hope that everyone will receive them with a humble heart, drop his own opinions, and go on with one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the first twelve chapters of the book of Acts, we see Peter as the main leading one among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot see any opinions at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the latter part of the book of Acts, from chapters thirteen to twenty-eight, Paul was in the lead, and again we mostly do not find opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, in Acts 21 James had certain opinions when Paul arrived at Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>James told Paul, You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then he went on to speak concerning the multitude of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, they believed in Jesus, but on the other hand, they also kept the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When they heard that Paul had taught people throughout the nations not to keep the law of Moses, they were deeply troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, James felt that there was a need for Paul to clarify his standing to them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>20-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this example we see James s opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible tells us that it was because of this opinion that Paul was arrested and put in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the surface Paul s imprisonment appeared to be negative, but in actuality it was God s salvation, rescuing him from the chaotic situation in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was for this reason that Paul was sent to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some years later in A.D. 70, God destroyed the entire city of Jerusalem through Titus and his Roman army.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church in Jerusalem and all that belonged to the church were completely destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This reveals to us how terrible opinions can be.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we have sounded the trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this ministry we have only one leading without any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, this does not mean that everyone in the Lord s recovery has to receive this leading.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If someone receives this leading, he is in the Lord s recovery, and if he does not receive it, he is still in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This sounding of the trumpet is similar to that of Gideon in Judges 7.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament Gideon came out to sound the trumpet for the sake of fighting the battle, but not every Israelite was able or willing to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many people came to Gideon, but God told him that he could not use them all and that he had to test their true condition by their drinking of water.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, God chose only three hundred among them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Gideon took this three hundred with him, won the battle, and saved the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our deep burden is to sound the trumpet to all of you in the hope of gaining those who will be like the three hundred warriors who went with Gideon.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone should hear only one calling and receive one leading without any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Experience tells us that things often start off well, but gradually as opinions creep in, the situation changes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is terrible and very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must realize that what has caused divisions in Christianity is nothing other than opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is opinions that have frustrated the Lord s work, causing Him to have no way on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Consider the Lord s work on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is absolutely no way for the Lord in Protestantism and Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In their early days the Brethren saw the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible was no longer closed but gradually was opened, made clear, and illuminated.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, less than two centuries later they became divided into more than a thousand separated groups.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was the result of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord s recovery has been on the earth for sixty to seventy years, and it faces the same problem of opinions which have frustrated the Lord s work and limited His multiplication and increase on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, it is important especially for all the young people who take the way of the Lord s recovery to learn the lesson of not expressing their opinions loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must realize that the recovery has had more than sixty years of history on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It has passed through many obstacles, turmoils, and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>During these years, there have also been much research and study.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While we cannot say that we have exhausted all the Christian publications, we have at least studied in great depth the important church histories, autobiographies, and core messages in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have also thoroughly studied the ways to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What we are doing today is presenting, to those who seek the Lord out of a pure heart, the things that we have learned, the things that we have come to know, and the things that the Lord has commissioned us with, as well as the revelation and vision that we have received from His word.</S>
