   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FOUR THE PREPARATION OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMANITY WITH HIS DIVINITY 2 Scripture Reading: Luke 1:39-56</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we began to consider the conception of John the Baptist, the Lord s forerunner, and the conception of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Luke 1:5-25 describes the conception of the forerunner, and 1:26-56, the conception of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall consider the blessing of the mother of the Man-Savior s forerunner vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>39-45 and the praise of the Man-Savior s mother vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>46-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE BLESSING OF HIS FORERUNNER S MOTHER Filled with the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Luke 1:41 says, And it came about as Elizabeth heard Mary s greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Elizabeth was the mother of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This verse tells us that she was filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no indication that she prayed or fasted in order to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This verse simply says that Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By being filled with the Spirit she blessed Mary, the mother of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Blessing the Man-Savior s Mother</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and the Fruit of Her Womb</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 42 says, And she lifted up her voice with a loud cry and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Elizabeth s blessing by the Holy Spirit v. 41 reveals the Savior s humanity as the fruit and His deity as the Lord v. 43 . Her blessing also confirms Mary s faith in the Lord s word v. 45 . Such a blessing indicates that Elizabeth was also a godly woman, fit for God s use in carrying out His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Greek word rendered fruit in verse 42, karpos, is used for Christ in the sense of offspring only here and in Acts 2:30.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This word is used for the fruit of the tree of life in Revelation 22:2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the branch of Jehovah Isa 4:2 and of David Jer 23:5 , and the fruit of Mary and of David that we may eat of Him as the tree of life Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is significant that Elizabeth blessed the fruit of Mary s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of using the word child, Elizabeth used the word fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is correct to say that the fruit here refers to a child.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But this word also indicates that the Lord Jesus is fruit to us, the fruit for us to take in as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Elizabeth also blessed Mary in verse 45: And blessed is she who believed, because there shall be a completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In contrast to the unbelieving Zachariah v. 20 , Mary believed what the angel said to her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Elizabeth said to Mary that there would be a completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was a prophecy by the Holy Spirit to confirm the Lord s word in verses 30 through 37 spoken to Mary by the angel Gabriel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Recognizing the Fruit of the Womb</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>of the Man-Savior s Mother as Her Lord</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 43 Elizabeth says, And how can this be, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Elizabeth, being filled with the Holy Spirit, recognized the fruit of Mary s womb as her Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that she acknowledged the deity of the Child to be born of Mary Psa 110:1; Matt 22:43-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the word fruit is used in the Scriptures to denote a child, it refers to humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, in 1:42 fruit refers to the Lord Jesus in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we see in verse 43 that Elizabeth went on to recognize this human One as her Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Elizabeth and Mary were cousins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No doubt, Elizabeth was much older than Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, this elderly woman recognized that the child of her younger cousin was her Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even before His birth, Elizabeth recognized that the Lord Jesus, the Man-Savior, was both man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In her blessing, therefore, we have a revelation of the divine-human Person of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Baby Leaping in Elizabeth s Womb</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>with Exultation</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 41 says that when Elizabeth heard Mary s greeting, the baby leaped in Elizabeth s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The forerunner of the Man-Savior even exulted upon meeting the Savior, while both of them were still in their mothers wombs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Concerning this, Elizabeth says in verse 44, For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby leaped in my womb with exultation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is marvelous and beyond our understanding.</S>
