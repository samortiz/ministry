   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 15 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 21:12-14, 17-19</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>12 And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all those who were selling and buying in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling the doves,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>13 And He said to them, It is written, "My house shall be called a house of prayer," but you are making it a den of robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>14 And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>17 And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>18 Now in the morning as He returned to the city, He became hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>19 And seeing a 1 fig tree on the way, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And He said to it, May there 2 no longer be fruit from you forever!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And the fig tree was instantly 3 dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord entered the city of Jerusalem, the first thing He did was cleanse the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Any earthly king, upon entering the capital, would immediately have ascended to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the Lord did not do this because He was not for His own interests, but for God's interests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His heart was not for His kingdom, but for God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the same in principle with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the day He came into us to be our life and our King, He did not enthrone Himself, but cleansed God's temple, which today is our spirit, the habitation of God Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our spirit should be a house of prayer, but because of the fall it has been made a den of robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when Jesus comes into us He drives all the robbers away and cleanses the temple of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the cleansing, the Lord healed the blind and the lame in the temple v. 14 . This indicates that His cleansing of the temple causes people to have the sight to see and the strength to move.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In His last visit to Jerusalem the Lord remained there only during the day for His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every evening He departed to lodge in Bethany, on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives Mark 11:19; Luke 21:37 , where the house of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus and the house of Simon were John 11:1; Matt 26:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Jerusalem He was rejected by the leaders of Judaism, but in Bethany He was welcomed by His lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In a very definite sense, today's religion is a Jerusalem to the Lord Jesus; it is not His lodging place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The lovers of Christ are not in Jerusalem, but in Bethany.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not be the Jerusalem people, but the Bethany lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 19 says, "And seeing a fig tree on the way, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time, the Lord Jesus came from God to Israel hungry for some fruit to satisfy God's hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, instead of fruit, He found only leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, He said to the fig tree, "May there no longer be fruit from you forever!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And the fig tree was instantly dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to our experience, we can testify that first the meek King comes into us, and we welcome Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, He comes in not to be enthroned, but to cleanse the temple of God, because He cares for God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Caring also for God's satisfaction, He desires fruit from God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But most of His people cannot afford Him any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a result, they are dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever someone is dried up, his spirit does not function.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, there is no temple and no fruit, no proper worship and no satisfaction to God.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>19 1 The fig tree here is a symbol of the nation of Israel Jer 24:2, 5, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This tree was full of leaves but fruitless, signifying that at that time the nation of Israel was full of outward show but had nothing that could satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>19 2 This signifies the curse on the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>19 3 From that time the nation of Israel was truly dried up.</S>
