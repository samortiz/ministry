[1]  We must realize that we Christians are a meeting people.
[2]  There is no way for any Christian to serve God without meetings, and it is impossible for Christians to express Christ if there are no meetings.
[3]  Because you have been born again, because you have the life of God within you, because you have a divine and heavenly nature, you are a part of the church in nature, but in position you are outside of the church.
[4]  Then immediately following, in verse 18, the Lord Jesus said something about the exercise of the authority of the church.
[5]  He said, Whatsoever ye that means the church bind, the heavens will bind, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, the heavens will loose.
[6]  We are told in Acts 2, in the early days of the church that the believers in Jerusalem met in houses.
[7]  We have seen that in the church in Jerusalem there were tens of thousands of believers meeting in many houses, yet they were still under one group of elders, they were still called the church at Jerusalem.
[8]  They may have had hundreds of meetings, but all these many meetings were still one church.
[9]  Lord, build up such a church here in Los Angeles with tens of thousands of believers and with many meetings to show the enemy, to show Thy people, that it is absolutely possible for the Lord to do this today.
[10]  If we meet in a divisive way, if we meet without keeping the oneness of the church, we are damaging the Body of Christ by our meetings, we are frustrating the building up of the church.
[11]  We have seen something concerning the matter of meeting from the middle of the Gospel of Matthew.
[12]  Now we are in the Lord s resurrection, and in this record we can see many things regarding the matter of how we should meet.
[13]  Have you realized that within that short time following the Lord s resurrection and before His ascension He had a good number of meetings with His disciples?
[14]  Do we have the boldness to say that we are meeting as the very brothers of the Lord?
[15]  You know, many times when we are sharing something of our experiences of the Lord in the meeting, while we are talking, Jesus Himself is with us; we are so conscious of His presence in our midst.
[16]  We must always be outside of religion without any form; we must always meet in resurrection as the Lord s brethren; we must meet with some personal experience of Christ in the place chosen and appointed by Him; and we must gather to meet the Lord, to satisfy Him and be satisfied by Him.
[17]  In the last chapter we have covered six principles of meeting from the last chapters of the Gospels and the opening chapters of the book of Acts.
[18]  From all the instances of the Lord Jesus meeting with His disciples after His resurrection we can see fourteen principles regarding the matter of meeting.
[19]  We must realize that after the Lord s resurrection, including the time of Pentecost, the record we have is that of the Lord Jesus continually meeting with His disciples.
[20]  In Matthew 28 we read that when they saw the Lord Jesus on the mountain, immediately they worshipped Him Matt 28:16-17 .
[21]  When we meet with the Lord in His resurrection, we meet on one hand as His very brothers, but on the other hand we have to worship Him.
[22]  It is not just to greet Him, not just to hail Him as did His disciples, but to worship Him.
[23]  In John chapter twenty we read that when the Lord Jesus met with His disciples, He breathed upon them v. 22 . Oh, how we need the Lord to breathe upon us when we meet together! I have heard the saints pray many times before they have come to the meeting: O Lord, give us a good speaker.
[24]  In all these cases of the Lord meeting with His disciples after His resurrection, He spoke to them.
[25]  So in our meetings we must look to the Lord that He would grant us this, that He would give us an opened Bible that we may see more things of Christ.
[26]  The Lord did something more: when He met with His disciples after His resurrection He gave them a commission Matt 28:19-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:47-48; Acts 1:8 .
[27]  This is the Gospel preaching; in the Bible the Gospel preaching includes all these things the preaching of repentance and forgiveness, the reality of all the preachers as living witnesses of Jesus Christ, and the baptizing of people into the Triune God.
[28]  Let us enumerate all the meetings which the Lord Jesus had with His disciples after His resurrection.
[29]  Today people say they are having Bible study meetings, prayer meetings, fellowship meetings, Gospel meetings, etc. I would not say it is wrong to arrange things in this way, but we must realize that whenever we meet, we meet firstly with the resurrected Christ and then for the ascended Christ.
[30]  We all must learn to meet with the resurrected Christ, not just with the Bible, not just with the hymn book, not just with some chairs and a piano, not just with the saints.
[31]  It is so clear that He is the very Christ who is living in the Spirit.
[32]  The main thing that this resurrected Christ did in this kind of meeting was to breathe into His disciples and say to them, Receive ye the Holy Breath John 20:22 .
[33]  To meet with Christ, we need to breathe in Christ as life, but to meet for Christ, we need the rushing mighty wind to blow upon us Acts 2:1-2 .
[34]  To meet for the ascended Christ we need power to demonstrate that the One whom we serve is now in the heavens and has been made Lord and Christ Acts 2:33-36 .
[35]  Our Gospel meeting must be a meeting for the ascended Christ, declaring to the universe that the very Jesus whom the world has rejected has been made Lord and Christ.
[36]  In meetings with the resurrected Christ, the main factor is the breathing of the Holy Breath, the life-giving Spirit John 20:22 .
[37]  In meetings for the ascended Christ, the central matter is the blowing of the mighty rushing wind Acts 2:2 .
[38]  So in all the meetings with the resurrected Christ, we see Christ breathing Himself into His disciples as the breath of life, the Spirit of life.
[39]  The Lord appeared to Mary Magdalene first, and in the same day He showed Himself to Peter.
[40]  Do you know the reason in these two cases?
[41]  We have seen that the meetings which the early disciples had with the Lord Jesus can be classified into two kinds: meetings with the resurrected Christ and meetings for the ascended Christ.
[42]  According to the record of the last chapters of the Gospels and the first chapters of Acts, we can only have these two kinds of meetings there could not be a third.
[43]  It is quite interesting, as we have seen, that of the four Evangelists, two are for the resurrected Christ and two for the ascended Christ.
[44]  Matthew tells us that He is Emmanuel, God with us; so Matthew also tells us, Lo, I am with you all the days, even unto the completion of the age.
[45]  Here in Los Angeles we have many meetings with the resurrected Christ, but on some occasions we also have meetings for the ascended Christ.
[46]  Now we need to be exercised more that we may learn not only to meet with the resurrected Christ, but even more for the ascended Christ.
[47]  To meet with the resurrected Christ is easy: we can on such an occasion have a sense of the Lord s presence.
[48]  We all can testify that many times we do sense the presence of the resurrected Christ, but we do not have the sense that we are in the heavens with the ascended Christ.
[49]  To meet with the resurrected Christ we may have the feeling, but to meet for the ascended Christ we need not the feeling, but the faith.
[50]  We can feel something of the resurrected Christ, because He is here; but how can we feel something of the ascended Christ?
[51]  Why do we say we must be outside of religion?
[52]  Why do we say that we need to abandon all forms?
[53]  We have seen that the first mention of the meeting of believers in the New Testament is in Matthew 18:20.
[54]  The Lord Jesus told us here that where two or three are gathered together in His name, there He will be in the midst.
[55]  Many Christians today say they are meeting in the name of the Lord Jesus, but what does this mean?
[56]  If you asked me what it means to meet in the name of the Lord Jesus twenty-five years ago, I would have to answer, I do not know, I cannot tell.
[57]  That means, according to their teaching, that we must pray, that we must confess our sins, that we must tarry and pray with fasting for a certain time, and then suddenly in one of the meetings the Holy Spirit will descend upon us and we will have the manifestation of speaking in tongues.
[58]  In the entire New Testament, 1 Corinthians is almost the only book that deals with the matter of Christian meetings.
[59]  There is nothing mentioned regarding Christian meetings in the book of Romans, and in all the other Epistles there is barely a mention of it.
[60]  In 1 Corinthians there are sixteen chapters, out of which we have one portion or section which deals with the matter of meetings.
[61]  With the foregoing in mind, I would present to you a full picture of 1 Corinthians.
[62]  These three chapters that we have been considering, chapters twelve through fourteen, are not an isolated portion but simply a part of the whole message of 1 Corinthians; so we must see them in relationship to the whole.
[63]  In chapter one we are told that we have been called into the fellowship of Christ v. 9 . This means that we have been called by God into the enjoyment of Christ.
[64]  Then we are told that Christ is God s wisdom and God s power as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption vv.
[65]  2, 7, 10 ; and if we are going to realize all these deep things of God, we must be in the spirit, we must be spiritual vv.
[66]  This reveals to us that if we are going to have the gifts, if we are going to meet in a proper way, we must experience and enjoy the Christ which this book presents; then we will have Him as our life in the spirit in our daily walk.
[67]  According to the entire context of 1 Corinthians, the proper way for us to meet together is that firstly we must have a daily walk with Christ as our life, with Christ as our enjoyment, with Christ as our everything.
[68]  To live by Christ, to take Christ as our life in our daily walk, is absolutely a matter of being in the spirit.
[69]  It is the real practice of the exercise of our spirit.
[70]  You know that when you persist in arguing you are out of the spirit; you are exercising your mind and your emotions, not your spirit.
[71]  If you do not live in the spirit and exercise your spirit in your daily walk, how can you possibly exercise your spirit to prophesy when you come to the meeting?
[72]  Exercise your spirit continually and you will enjoy Christ and experience Him; then when you come to the meeting, out of your habit of exercising your spirit, you will have the boldness to stand up and prophesy something of Christ.
[73]  Christ is our portion, Christ is everything to us, Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and we are joined unto Him in one spirit.
[74]  When we consider the matter of meetings, it is very difficult to depart from the book of 1 Corinthians.
[75]  Just in this one book meeting together is mentioned at least eight times.
[76]  For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ...
[77]  I am so happy that we have such a chapter as this in the Bible.
[78]  Let us firstly read verse 10: And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord.
[79]  But if I answer, Brother, I dare not say that I am in the Spirit I just feel that I must utter something; it may only be my opinion, but I think I have at least a little of the Spirit of God ; I tell you, if I could answer in this way, I am a real and spiritual prophet.
[80]  Now let us go on to see more verses in this book regarding the human spirit.
[81]  In chapter seven, verse 34, we read, The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.
[82]  Then in chapter eight, verse 12, we read, But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
[83]  Now notice chapter ten, verses 28 and 29: But if any man say unto you, this is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord s, and the fulness thereof: conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man s conscience?
[84]  We have seen in chapter one that Christ to us is the power and wisdom of God v. 24 ; and of God are we in Christ Jesus, who is made unto us wisdom righteousness, sanctification and redemption v. 30 . Then he goes on to tell us that this Christ who is the last Adam has been made a life-giving Spirit 15:45 . Now all that He is to us must be realized, must be experienced not by any other organ of our being but the spirit.
[85]  In chapter six we are told that the Holy Spirit of God dwells in us v. 19 and that he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit v. 17 . Then we have chapter seven, which as we have seen, is so wonderful.
[86]  In chapter eleven we see that when we are not meeting in the spirit, we are meeting not for a profit but for a loss v. 17 . Then from chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen, we have seen that the two main things we need are love and prophecy.
[87]  Finally in chapter fifteen we are told that this Christ who is our love and our life, our prophecy and our function, is the life-giving Spirit v. 45 . And in chapter sixteen Paul said that the brothers have refreshed his spirit and the spirit of others v. 18 . He said, Let all your things be done in love, and, My love be with you all in Christ Jesus vv.
[88]  We have gone through the entire sixteen chapters of 1 Corinthians, chapter by chapter.
[89]  This is the foundation, this is the basis for our meeting together.
[90]  Following chapter fourteen, we still have two chapters, telling how Christ is the life-giving Spirit, how our spirit needs to be continually refreshed with Christ, and how we need to live, move and do everything in love.
[91]  The book of 1 Corinthians tells us that Christ was made a life-giving Spirit.
[92]  If He were not such a life-giving Spirit, all that He is would just be objective to us.
[93]  But now He is the Spirit dwelling within our spirit, so that we can be one with Him in spirit.
[94]  By taking Christ as everything in our spirit, we can have a proper life, we can enjoy Him all the day.
[95]  If we read through 1 Corinthians again and again, and let us be reminded that this is practically the only book in the New Testament dealing with meetings, we will come to the conclusion that to build up the church we must prophesy.
[96]  He told the Corinthians in effect, When I come to you, I determine not to know anything but Christ; now you must follow me, you must follow me to prophesy in this way, not in a miraculous way, but in the way of ministering Christ to others that the church may be built up.
[97]  This is not a matter of learning methods methods do not work.
[98]  In a certain place in this country I heard the following: When we first began to meet together, all the people in the meeting were seated in one direction.
[99]  Then we learned that the church in Los Angeles seated the people in four directions; so we changed the arrangement of our chairs accordingly.
[100]  But we learned, however, that when the people were seated in one direction, there was only one direction of death in the meetings; then, after we changed the seating to four directions, there were four directions of death in the meetings.
[101]  If we are going to speak something for Christ, we must live by Christ.
[102]  Suppose that we are this kind of people; do you think that when we come together we could speak something for Christ?
[103]  CHAPTER TWELVE BY SINGING PRAISES THE PRIMARY FUNCTION IN MEETINGS
[104]  First Corinthians 14:26 says that when we all come together everyone has something, and the first item is a psalm; therefore, the psalm is the primary function in the meeting.
[105]  By this we must realize that the first thing we must do in the meetings is to sing praises.
[106]  The central matter in the meeting of the church is to prophesy, to speak something for Christ, that the church might be built up, but the first thing in the meetings of the church is to praise.
[107]  Most of us are familiar with this Psalm, but in order to help us realize its message I must refer to the previous Psalms.
[108]  In Psalms 3 through 7, we see how sad was the situation of the Psalmist.
[109]  But suddenly in Psalm 8 the Spirit came in with this: O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth!
[110]  Regardless of how weak you are, regardless of how weak I am, regardless of how weak we all are, if we will open our mouths and say, O Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth, God will establish the strength to shut the mouths of all the enemies.
[111]  In Ephesians we are told not only to sing and make melody, but also to speak one to another 5:19 speaking to yourselves should be speaking one to another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
[112]  When we have the Word of Christ dwelling in us richly, we will be full of Christ, we will have the outpouring of the inner fulness in singing and praising.
[113]  It says praise the Lord in this way, then praise the Lord in the second way, then praise the Lord in the third way, etc., etc. There are ten ways of praising the Lord.
[114]  The highest point and peak of prayer is praise.
[115]  Praise is much better than prayer; so we must go on from prayer to praise.
[116]  When you pray and pray until you reach the highest point, then prayer is over and praise begins.
[117]  The answer is this: when we are singing to the Father, Jesus is singing within us.
[118]  But here is a problem: are you sure that whenever you sing in the church, Christ is singing within your singing?
[119]  If God says this to you, you must tell Him, O God, You are not just, You are not righteous, You are not fair in saying this, because my substitute Christ has died for me.
[120]  How is such a oneness actually and practically realized?
[121]  Only by our being altogether in the Spirit and in our spirit.
[122]  Christ was incarnated, crucified, resurrected, glorified, and enthroned; and after all this, such a Christ was made the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.
[123]  This wonderful Christ, this all-inclusive Spirit, has come to indwell our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 , and today He is one Spirit with our spirit.
[124]  But we must be sure that we are in the spirit, that we are speaking in the spirit, that we are singing in the spirit.
[125]  1 Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered: let them also that hate Him flee before Him.
[126]  Let us look firstly at a few verses in Revelation.
[127]  And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Sion, and with Him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father s name written in their foreheads.
[128]  And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and the voice which I heard was as of harpers harping with their harps: and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.
[129]  We all can praise Him in a general way, in a religious way, in a natural way; but if we would praise Him in a special and deeper way, we need some experience of Him.
[130]  But not only does God need a habitation we also need a home.
[131]  So in this Psalm we have words such as a home and a family, etc. God placeth the solitary in families and giveth the desolate a home to dwell in v. 6 . Thus, we have these two aspects of the second main point: God s habitation and our home.
[132]  We must realize that God s habitation is our home, and our home must be His habitation.
[133]  This dwelling place is a mutual habitation: God dwells in us and we dwell in God.
[134]  Not only do we enjoy all that God is to us, but we enjoy the spoils of Christ s victory The women that tarry at home divide the spoil v. 12 . What are the spoils? They are the wings of a dove covered with silver and its pinions with glittering gold v. 13 . The dove is the Spirit, and wings in the Bible signify flying power.
[135]  The first point is the victory of Christ, the second point is the building up of God s habitation on this earth, and the third point is the enjoyment of God in Christ with all the spoils of His victory in the local church.
[136]  Firstly we must praise God for Christ s victory.
[137]  Verse 4 says, Sing unto God, sing praises to His name: triumph in Him that rideth through the deserts or, upon the storm clouds .
[138]  God gave the divine life with the divine nature to His Son Christ; God gave His Holy Spirit to His Son Christ; and God gave all those chosen before the foundation of the world, all the chosen rebels, including you, to His Son Christ.
[139]  Now notice who it is that divides the spoil: The women that tarry at home... v. 12 . Not the men, but the women; not by toiling, laboring, or fighting, but by tarrying at home.
[140]  There is no need for us to toil and fight the battle; the battle is over, the victory is already won!
[141]  Today in the local church, in God s home, we are simply dividing the spoil day by day.
[142]  Firstly we must experience all these things: we must experience the victory of Christ over all His enemies; we must share and partake of the spoils of Christ s victory; we must have the experience of the wings of the dove covered with silver and gold.
[143]  At the end of the Psalm God rebukes His enemies from His temple vv.
[144]  In verses 21, 22, and 23, God says that He will smite the head of the enemies and bring them again from the depth of the Red Sea that we may dip our feet in their blood.
[145]  In the book of Hebrews we are told mainly that the Lord Jesus today is in the heavens as the great High Priest, interceding for us continually.
[146]  While He is there in the heavens interceding for us, He is also here in the midst of the church singing hymns of praise to the Father.
[147]  If we do have the proper and adequate way to meet, we should have the certainty deep within us that when we are singing, when we are praising, the Lord Jesus is singing and praising within us.
[148]  Now let us go on to the last passage in this book regarding Christian meetings chapter thirteen, verse 15.
[149]  Through him note the change from by him to through him, which is the proper translation therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips confessing His name.
[150]  Put these three passages together: 1 Christ is in the midst of the church, singing hymns of praise to the Father; 2 we must not neglect to come together, we must have a meeting habit; and 3 through Him we must offer praises to God.
[151]  By these three passages we are abundantly clear that whenever we meet there must be the possibility of the Lord Jesus singing praises to the Father, and whenever we come together we must be praising, not talking, witnessing or prophesying so much, but praising praising through Him.
[152]  The entire book of Hebrews teaches that Christ is better than so many things: Christ is better than Judaism and any kind of religion; Christ is better than this and better than that; Christ is all the best things this is the book of Hebrews.
[153]  But this book, while it tells how Christ is better than so many things, also tells and encourages us to enjoy such a Christ, not just to know Him, but to experience Him.
[154]  Now I do not ask people to sign a paper, but I do say that if we would have a proper meeting, we must see Jesus, we must have the real experience of the Jesus revealed in this book.
[155]  In chapter twelve, verse 2, we have, Looking unto Jesus...
[156]  Look away unto Jesus not just see Him, but look unto Him.
[157]  In these days, however, the Lord is showing us the way that is, we all must experience Christ, we all must see Jesus; then when we come together we will have something so exciting to share of Him.
[158]  Only three books in all of the New Testament deal with the matter of meeting.
[159]  We have seen that Matthew, the first book of these three, tells us that we must meet in the name of the Lord Jesus 18:20 .
[160]  This means that we must meet in the Spirit, for the reality of the Lord s name is the Spirit.
[161]  In this book we see also that the way for us to meet is by praising, and the way for us to praise is by the Lord Jesus singing hymns of praise unto the Father in the midst of our meeting.
[162]  Since we have been made partakers of Christ, since we have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, since we have enjoyed Christ so much; therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of our praise.
[163]  I earnestly hope that the Lord will one day bring His church to spend more time for praising and less for teaching.
[164]  We all must taste this heavenly gift, we all must taste the good Word of God, we all must taste the power of the age to come, though we have not entered into that age 6:4, 5 .
[165]  In a sense we have tasted, but we are still tasting.
[166]  Some say the heavenly gift is this, and some say it is that, but the book of Hebrews does not say this or that; it just says the heavenly gift.
[167]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN A BETTER CHRIST FOR A BETTER PRAISE
[168]  There is still more concerning the riches of Christ in this book of Hebrews which we must see.
[169]  To enter into the concept of any writer is not easy, and to get into the spirit of those who wrote the Scriptures is even more difficult.
[170]  You may know all the passages word for word, you may understand all the sentences and know all the chapters, but it is not so easy to get into the spirit in which such a book was written.
[171]  Jesus has not only so many items in His person the God-Man, the One who is higher than the angels, the One more glorious than Moses, the real Joshua, the land, our companion, the Priest higher than Aaron and superior to Aaron; He also is far superior and better in what He has accomplished, in what He has given.
[172]  He has accomplished eternal redemption by His blood, and by His blood He has made the eternal covenant, the better covenant, which has been made an eternal will and testament to us.
[173]  The burden and concept of the writer of the book of Hebrews is this: you Jewish believers must be brought back to this wonderful One, this One who is far superior to all you have in Judaism.
[174]  What Judaism has is good, but what we have is better both in quality and in quantity.
[175]  But if you would do this you must realize firstly that Judaism, the best and even the genuine religion, is a camp which rejected Jesus.
[176]  Secondly we must consider Him, we must partake of Him, we must enjoy Him, we must look to Him, and we must go forth unto Him.
[177]  The less we have of Christ, the less we will desire to come to the meetings.
[178]  The more we are filled with Christ, the more we long for the meetings and require the meetings to express something of Him.
[179]  We need a meeting to say Hallelujah; we need a meeting to shout Amen; we need a meeting to release our spirit.
[180]  The more we praise in the meetings, the more we enjoy the Lord s presence, for while we are praising, He praises in our praising.
[181]  Not only must we know Christ as everything better than everything, not only must we labor to enter into the good land and all the enjoyment of Christ, not only must we come together filled with His praises, but we must also practice composing our praises from the new vocabulary of our experiences of Christ.
[182]  At this point we need another insertion to see how in our praises we need Christ as our incense.
[183]  Now we come to the essence of all these spices and the pure frankincense.
[184]  It is really difficult to interpret these, but with the aid of many dictionaries and some writings of ancient times we may arrive at their meaning.
[185]  In the first chapter of his Gospel he says, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world v. 29 . Then in chapter twelve of the same Gospel he says that Christ is the grain of wheat, which when it falls into the earth and dies produces many grains v. 24 . As the Lamb of God He has the animal life, and as the grain of wheat He has the plant life.
[186]  In the prescription for the ointment recorded in Exodus 30, definite quantities are designated for each ingredient.
[187]  We have seen how all the ingredients of the incense include and signify both the Person and work of the Lord Jesus His divinity mingled with humanity, and His all-inclusive death and resurrection.
[188]  We have also seen that the incense is mainly of four ingredients, but that there is another fifth ingredient, salt, added in. So we may say that it is of four kinds of fragrant drugs, and we may also say that it is of five elements.
[189]  This means that our praises must have Christ as their content, that we must praise God with Christ, with all that He is and all He has accomplished.
[190]  The first thing which connects these two altars is the redeeming blood.
[191]  When we burn the incense, however, we should not offer strange incense.
[192]  You may be an exceedingly fine person humble, patient and gentle, etc. If we are such, there is always within us a kind of subconscious concept that in ourselves we are fairly good.
[193]  Let us be clear about the matter of our emotions.
[194]  We have seen the two altars in the house of God, one for offering and the other for burning the incense, one for redemption and the other for acceptance.
[195]  Both are united, as we have seen, by the redeeming blood and the consuming, heavenly fire.
[196]  In order to reach the altar of incense, God s people must firstly labor upon the good land.
[197]  Without laboring on the land we have nothing to offer at the first altar; we cannot even take the first step.
[198]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE PRAISING FROM PSALM FORTY-FIVE WITH A BUBBLING HEART
[199]  Here in Psalm 45 we have some principles for composing praises to the Lord.
[200]  When we look into the entire Psalm, we see that this good matter concerns the King and the Queen.
[201]  The King, we know, is Christ, and the Queen is the church; hence, the good matter with which the heart of the Psalmist bubbles over is Christ and the church.
[202]  If we have composed something beforehand, when we arrive in the meeting, our tongue will be the pen of a ready writer.
[203]  Firstly, we need the experience with which to bubble over; secondly, we need the composition before coming to the meeting; and thirdly, we need to exercise our tongue.
[204]  We need to be bubbling over with Christ and the church, we need to compose something before coming to the meeting, and we need to practice speaking what we have already composed when we come to the meeting.
[205]  If we would render Him complete praise, we must say something concerning Himself, we must speak about His Queen, and we must also utter something regarding His children.
[206]  Firstly we need to praise with what Christ is.
[207]  Praise the Lord, we have the first robe, but we need the second robe that we may not only praise Christ, but be a praise to Christ.
[208]  Then we come to the third section, the praise to the King about His children.
[209]  On one hand we are the daughters and we are the virgins, but on the other hand we are the princes, the children of Christ, who will rule the earth under Christ.
[210]  May the Lord bring us more deeply into all these things, and may we exercise our spirit to compose and use our tongue as a pen to write praises touching Christ, the church, and all the saints.
[211]  Now we come to the matter of how to come to the meetings not how to carry on the meetings or how to behave ourselves in the meetings, but how to come to the meetings before we arrive.
[212]  Our coming to the meeting should be a kind of preparation; it is our opportunity to be properly prepared for the meeting.
[213]  Many of us frequently come to the meetings without preparation we come in a wrong way.
[214]  But when you look at these verses in the Psalms and consider their experiences in coming to the congregation of the Lord s people, you see how backward we are.
[215]  The second matter is this We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company Psa 55:14 .
[216]  Before we come to the meeting, it is good to have some fellowship.
[217]  We need the love of the meetings, we need the sweet counsel or fellowship, we need to come in company with a multitude, we need to come with a voice of joy, we need to come with thanksgiving and praise, we need to come giving glory unto God, and finally we need to come with our spiritual hands full of offerings to be offered to God.
[218]  The Apostle Paul says in 1 Timothy 4:7, Exercise thyself rather unto godliness.
[219]  By reading this verse in the context of the entire two Epistles to Timothy, we see that the matter of exercising ourselves unto godliness refers to the real exercise of our human spirit.
[220]  We must exercise our spirit to contact God and in so many things related to God.
[221]  We need practice to build up a habit of opening our mouths; we need practice to learn how to utter praises and how to compose praises from our experiences of Christ.
[222]  Let us suppose now that we are having a meeting.
[223]  We have learned already that we need not wait for the stated hour to begin as soon as some brothers and sisters are together we may start to praise.
[224]  In fact, we may even begin the meeting on the street while we are coming in. It may be started at any time and by any way it must be something of the Spirit without forms and regulations.
[225]  We may begin with a hymn, with a testimony, by calling on the Lord, or by praising the Lord.
[226]  Now I must speak a word concerning our utterances while pray-reading or praise-reading the Word.
[227]  I do believe it would be more impressive if we would on the one hand use the very words of the verses as our prayers or praises and on the other hand mingle the Word with our fresh experiences.
[228]  A word now to those who are so accustomed to open their mouths in a natural way in the meetings: I beg you to be somewhat restricted.
[229]  I do not believe the Lord is so happy to listen to you, because you are so used to speaking.
