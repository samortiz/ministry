   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being charged to eat the right tree, indicating that God created for man a free will and that God wanted man to exercise his free will to choose Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's prohibiting man from eating the tree of knowledge indicating that God wanted man to receive Him as life by enjoying Him John 1:11-12; Col 2:6.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man needing to be God's vessel to contain Him Eph 3:17a.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Focus: The focus of this message should be man being God's container.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message we want to see that the man created by God is a vessel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. WITH A SPIRIT AS THE RECEPTACLE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TO RECEIVE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's intention in making man is to have a vessel that can contain Him and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this message we want to stress this one crucial point the man created by God is a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among many Christians this concept is absent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians think that man should be used by God as an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The highest thought they have is that man should be God's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the thought of man being a vessel of God is not with them, because there is not such a thought in our human mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In God's thought man is just a container, not a means or an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Unless man can be a vessel, a container to contain God and to be filled up with God, man can never be used by God to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Balaam, the Gentile prophet, was someone used by God, but in a very, very negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is because he was a prophet but he did not become a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was not a container of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Romans 9:21 and 23 Paul told us that God's creation of man was just to produce, to create, man as a vessel to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God created man as a vessel to contain Him just as a potter makes a vessel of clay to contain something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Corinthians 4:7 also conveys this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The apostle Paul considered himself as an earthen vessel to contain a treasure, and the treasure is just Christ, the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, in Romans 9 and 2 Corinthians 4 we can see a clear revelation that man was created by God to be His vessel to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a container to contain God, man needs a receptacle to receive God, and this is the unique difference between God's creation of man and His creation of other things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God did not give any other created thing a spirit except man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Genesis 2:7, God created man with the dust to form a body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then He breathed the breath of life into man's nostrils, and man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 2:7 shows us a picture of man as a vessel made by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is the need of a receptacle within man to receive and contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today's radio has an outward box and an inward receiver to receive the invisible radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Genesis 2:7 shows us that man has an outward body made with dust, and an inward receptacle, an inward receiver, produced by God's breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This inward receiver is the spirit of man.</S>
