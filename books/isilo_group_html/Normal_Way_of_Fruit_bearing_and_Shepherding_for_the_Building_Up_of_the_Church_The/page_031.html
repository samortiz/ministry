<h1 class="title">SHEPHERDING PEOPLE<br />
IN THE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:45b; Gal. 2:20; John 15:4; Rom. 8:2, 6, 10; Phil. 3:8-10</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw fifteen practical points concerning shepherding. Many of these points covered the things we should not do. We should not go out to contact people with the concept that we can do many things or that we know many things. We must first learn that we can do nothing. If we are truly unloaded in this way, we can go on to learn further matters. In this message we will consider some basic, positive items for our shepherding of others in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SHEPHERDING PEOPLE IN THE EXPERIENCES OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Helping People in Each Stage of Life<br />
to Have Particular Experiences</h2>
<p>We need to shepherd people in the way of experience. This is not simply to share our experiences with them. Rather, when we care for young ones, new ones, and weak ones, we need to know where they are in their experience. We may use the educational system to illustrate the way to help people. If a teacher knows what grades a child has completed, he can help him to advance in a proper way. In the old days in China, those who did not accept the modern educational system would learn only a few things each year in a very general way. By the time they were middle-aged, some still could not write properly. In contrast, all the children in the modern educational system could write well after only a few years. These children learned in the proper way without wasting time. Too many people in Christianity today are not on the proper way. My own mother was baptized and taught in a Christian school when she was young. Because she attended Christian meetings and learned some things there, she was able to tell her children stories from Genesis and the four Gospels. After we were saved, however, we realized that she was not yet saved. She knew many things, but she had no particular experience of salvation. This illustrates our need to help those who are under our shepherding to have definite, particular experiences of life.</p>
<p>We must first know whether someone is clear about the assurance of salvation. Someone may come to the church meetings, but if he is not truly saved, he is not actually in the church. Although we believe that almost everyone in our meetings is saved, some of the new ones who have come into the church life only recently may not have the assurance of salvation. If we check with them, they may say, &ldquo;I believe I am saved, but I am not very sure.&rdquo; Without the assurance of salvation, it is hard for anyone to go on. Salvation is our foundation, and the assurance of salvation is our motivation. If anyone does not have the assurance that he has been fully saved, it is difficult for him to go on.</p>
<p>If someone is clear concerning his salvation, we should go on from the assurance of salvation to another experience. Perhaps we can help him to have a particular experience of consecration. He is clear about salvation, but he may never have consecrated himself to the Lord. We should not merely pass on a little knowledge about consecration. Instead, we must pray for him, contact him, have fellowship with him, and do something to help him to fully pass through the experience of consecration. Then for eternity he can never say that he has not consecrated himself. To be saved is a particular, initial experience, and following this, people need the assurance of salvation. These are the first two experiences they need. Then we need to help them to pass through a particular, definite, specific experience of consecration. Our ability to do this depends on whether we ourselves have had this experience. After we help people in this way, we can go on to another experience. No doubt, they also need to have a definite experience of clearing their past. In actuality, the clearance of the past and consecration go together.</p>
<p>We must have a particular burden for the new ones. We may realize that a certain brother is very promising but that he has never consecrated himself to the Lord. Then we should not touch this matter in a shallow way. We need to touch this in the deepest way. First we may give him our own testimony and tell him how so many saints in the past consecrated themselves to the Lord. We should contact him several times until we see that he has truly passed through this experience.</p>
<p>After consecration and clearance of the past, we can go on to further experiences. How far we can go with others depends on how far we have gone on. We can help others only to the extent of our own experience. In mathematics, for example, if we have learned only addition and subtraction, this is all that we can teach. If we have had adequate experiences of life, we can help people in a further way. Perhaps we can move on to the inner anointing. To help someone under our care to experience this will take a long time. We need this kind of shepherding, a shepherding according to an &ldquo;educational system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I strongly recommend the book <em>The Experience of Life.</em> This book was taken from a training course given from 1953 to 1954, which was based on all the experiences of the inner life taught by the saints from the first century. In particular, it relied on a book by Madame Guyon entitled <em>Life out of Death&mdash;Spiritual Torrent.</em> Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis used Madame Guyon&rsquo;s writing very much in her expositions. We received help from both authors, we digested what they spoke, and we added something further. <em>Spiritual Torrent</em> is somewhat difficult to understand, but today it is very easy to read <em>The Experience of Life.</em> If someone reads from it for ten minutes a day, he can finish the book in a short time. The four stages in the spiritual life mentioned by Madame Guyon are covered in this book, including nineteen experiences of life, and they are presented in a very &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; way. Everything related to our physical life can be known scientifically. If we care for our eating, breathing, drinking, working, and resting in a scientific way, we will be healthy. Likewise, we can know the things of the spiritual life in a scientific way. What is presented in <em>The Experience of Life</em> is not a mere theory, consideration, or imagination. It is based on the experiences of many seeking saints through the centuries. We should first shepherd ourselves by using this book to check our experience. Doing this will help us to know if we are in &ldquo;high school,&rdquo; &ldquo;college,&rdquo; or &ldquo;graduate school&rdquo; in our spiritual experience. Then we will know where we are and what our need is.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Normal Way of Fruit-bearing and Shepherding for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
