   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many ways of reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Reading it through sequentially from beginning to end is only one way of reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is another way of reading, which a Christian should practice as soon as he begins his Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is reading early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is one condition for this kind of reading of the Word one has to rise up early every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is another matter if you are sick and you are told by a doctor to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But every normal, healthy person should rise up early.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the sun comes out, the manna is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people read the Bible too late; therefore, they cannot read it well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You must catch the early morning hour to read God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, no one can rise up early if he goes to bed late.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is another matter if some are required to stay up late by their work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But many people have no special reason to go to bed late; they have built up the habit of putting things off until the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When they go to bed late, they cannot rise early.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some people are not busy at all; they just like to waste their time at night.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They like to stay a little longer in the sitting room and chat a little longer, and before they know it, half an hour has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whoever wastes or ill-manages his time this way will find it hard to rise up early; it will be hard for him to do anything in a systematic way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to develop the habit of retiring to bed on time and rising on time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many people are very weak when it comes to the matter of rising.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They cannot control themselves and cannot rise up early to touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As soon as possible, young Christians should develop the habit of rising early.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may find it hard the first day; however, by the second or third day, they will not find it as hard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After a period of time, it will become natural to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One brother was determined to rise up between half-past four and five o'clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he woke up the first morning, it was six o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he woke up the second morning, it was six o'clock again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was determined to get up at five.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The next night he constantly looked at the clock and did not sleep well from two until five in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He realized that this was not right, because when he did not sleep well at night, it was harder for him to rise up in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He realized that the only thing he could do was look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the third night, he prayed, "God, I am going to sleep now.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I commit myself to Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please wake me up at five tomorrow morning."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then he went to sleep soundly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The next morning when he woke up, he was afraid that it was six o'clock again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But thank the Lord, it was exactly five o'clock; it was not a minute late or early.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From that day on and for many years, he woke up at the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We believe that when we truly commit ourselves to God, He will wake us up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am not saying that everyone should rise up at five o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you can rise up earlier, it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if you have some hardship, you may need to rise up later.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not suggest going to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all have to judge ourselves according to our physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to learn how many hours of sleep we need and when we need to go to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we will know when we can get up in the morning, whether it is five o'clock, half-past five, or six o'clock.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to plan well before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once we make our plan, we can rise up every morning according to our plan to read God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can testify that reading the Word early in the morning is the best nourishment for our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can read the Bible at other times, but reading it in the morning has a different flavor to it, and it reaps special benefits for us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we have not experienced the benefit of reading the Word early in the morning, I hope that we will start practicing it and will not miss out on this blessing.</S>
