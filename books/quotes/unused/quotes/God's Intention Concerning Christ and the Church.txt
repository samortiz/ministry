Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light'
We need to be clear that in eternity past God the Father predestinated us to partake of Christ and Christ alone
As the image of God, Christ is the manifestation and declaration of God, the One through whom we are able to see and know God
In addition to seeing God's intention that Christ would be our portion, we need to consider why God desires this
We also know that our physical life is not the real life, because our physical life is not an eternal life; it lasts for only a short time
Paul says that food, drink, the feasts, the new moon, and the Sabbath are all shadows, the body of which is Christ
We may have many articles of clothing and may dress very well, but we must realize that our clothing is not our real covering
If we do not have Christ, outwardly we may appear healthy and well-dressed, but in reality we are poor, hungry, naked, and in darkness
As servants of the Lord, we did not like to dress in a worldly way, but everyone around us was dressed in such a way
Others may say that they have experienced Christ as their bread by experiencing a particular verse in the Bible
The day before making this statement, the Lord fed five thousand people with only a few pieces of bread and some fish
From this we can see that the Lord's desire is that we would experience Him in a very practical and even ordinary way in our daily living
The life that we received from our parents is not our real life it is only a figure and a shadow pointing us to Christ who is our real life
We surely need to receive the Lord's word, but in addition to receiving His word, we need to experience Christ Himself
We need to realize that Christ is our life and then apply Him in all the things that happen to us in our daily living
In Philippians 3 Paul says that he counted everything other than Christ to be loss, dross, and even refuse, dung
A normal Christian is one who is always taking Christ as his life in an ordinary and practical way in his daily living
We should not think that speaking with our children is an easy matter and that we do not need Christ in this matter
As believers, we are not dealing with a set of teachings or doctrines; we are dealing with a living person-the living Son of the living God
In the second half of verse 6 Paul continues this emphasis when he says, 'The mind set on the spirit is life and peace'
In Romans 8 Paul uses three different titles when speaking of the Spirit-the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Christ
Because we are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, and we cry out to God as our Father
We know that we have the Spirit within us because the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God
Whenever we have the feeling that we are children of God, we must realize that this feeling is something of the Spirit
It may be very weak, but this little feeling is strong proof that we are indeed children of God and that we have the Spirit of God within us
Even after we sin against God, we still sense in the innermost and deepest part of our being that we are children of God
We may feel sorrowful and ashamed of what we have done, yet we still sense in our deepest part that we are children of God
On the other hand, if a child does not have the life of a certain man, he cannot be that man's genuine son, regardless of how strong he is
A baby may be only one and a half feet long and weigh only six pounds yet that baby is still his fathers son because he has his fathers life
That baby may be childish and powerless, and he may not have any gifts or even be able to see, speak, walk, or eat properly
A baby cannot utter what he needs, but his mother, who is outside of him, can utter what she feels her baby needs
When we have this kind of experience, the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of the Son, the Spirit of life, is working within us
As long as we have the Spirit of life, the life of God, within us, we are sons of God no matter how weak we may be
Now that we have seen that being a son of God is a matter of life we must also see that in order to carry out the Lords work we need power
If you leave your baby at home, he may not need to be clothed, but it would be a shame to bring your baby into a public place naked
Acts 1:5 says, 'John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now'
The verse continues saying You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth
On the day of Pentecost the disciples received the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and this baptism was not a matter of life but of power
When we initially accept the Lord Jesus as our personal Savior, we receive the Spirit into us as the Spirit of life
In addition to receiving the Spirit of life into us we also need the Spirit as the Spirit of power to come upon us to equip us and clothe us
In order to properly handle the power that we receive by being clothed with the Spirit, we must have the adequate growth in life
The believers in Corinth had received the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the gifts that accompany this baptism
The Spirit is the Spirit of life, and the first of the nine items of the fruit of the Spirit listed in verses 22 and 23 is love
He told the Corinthians that although their outer man was decaying, their inner man was being renewed day by day
The fact that Paul did not mention the gifts in 2 Corinthians does not mean that there is no need for the gifts
There is still a need for the gifts but there is also a need for something morethe growth in life which enables us to use the gifts properly
On the one hand, some of the Lord's children have the divine life and a measure of growth in life, but they do not have any power
There are at least a few Christians who have the divine life, the baptism in the Spirit, and the growth in life
Those who call themselves 'fundamental' need power; they need the experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit
With life, power, and growth, all the dear children of the Lord will be a profit to the building up of the Body of Christ
We need to pray much that the Lord would vindicate this matter and prove to these dear ones that this is something of Him
Of course, it is true that some believers who are still childish have misused the baptism in the Spirit and have gone to an extreme
When some of the brothers and sisters received this experience, they took it to an extreme and began to do many strange things
As he did so, some of the other brothers and sisters took off their sweaters and coats and laid them on the ground in front of the brother
She told the other saints not to get a coffin because the sister who had died would rise up at twelve o'clock the next day
By receiving the Spirit of life through regeneration, we are born of God to be genuine sons of God, possessing His very life
We need the Spirit of life in order to be sons, and we need the Spirit of power in order to do the Lord's work
If we have life, power, and growth, we will be proper, balanced Christians who can be used by the Lord for His Body
When Adam, the father of the human race, partook of that tree, the knowledge of good and evil entered into the human race
It was added to prove that we are unable to do good and to show that even if we are able to do some good, our good does not please God
Due to the fall of man, human beings have the knowledge of good and evil and have the thought that they should try to do good
The human thought is that we must try our best to do good; God's thought is that we need Christ to be wrought into us
He confessed this to the Lord and made a decision that from that moment on he would never lose his temper again
To hate your wife is according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and to try to love your wife is also according to this tree
To do evil is according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and to try to do good is also according to this tree
Do you think that God's desire is to build good into you so that you will love your wife more than any other husband loves his wife?
He wants to build into us not love but Christ, not humility but Christ, not a good temper but Christ, and not patience but Christ
Formerly, he had thought that religion was the best thing, but when Christ was revealed in him, he realized that religion was a loss
When we have the element of Christ in our thoughts, desires, and choices, we will have the form of Christ within us
Eventually, we will be mingled with Christ to such an extent that it will be difficult to discern what is of us and what is of Christ
Rather, His desire is that we would be mingled with Christ so that Christ would be the One doing good through us
God has given us His Spirit , and this very Spirit is living within us as the Spirit of God's Son and the Spirit of life
If the inner feeling allows us to continue what we are doing, we may continue, but if the inner feeling does not allow it, we should stop
In addition, if we simply follow this inner sense all the time and in every matter, we will be people who please God
They realize that although we appear to be good people, in actuality we have broken the living fellowship and communion with the Spirit
We need to know the inner life, live by Christ, walk in the Spirit, and follow the inner consciousness moment by moment in every situation
At the beginning of Galatians Paul tells us that Christ is in us and toward the end of the book he writes concerning the fruit of the Spirit
When we reach the point when we are mature in the life of the Spirit, Christ will be formed in us and will be expressed through us
The Spirit is living, moving, working, and acting within us and is continually giving us an inner registration or sense
We must learn how to apply the cross to our being and how to follow the inner consciousness of the Spirit in order to walk by the Spirit
By our doing these things, Christ will occupy our whole being, will be formed within us, and will be manifested through us
The way for the life of the church to be healthy is for the church to be filled with the experience of Christ as life
We can never overstress the fact that the reality of the church is Christ Himself as life to every member of the Body
If we study the situation of Christianity, we will find that although this truth is so critical, it has been almost entirely ignored
Although one may be able to hear many messages, it would be very difficult to find one message on the subject of Christ as life
There would likely be a great amount of teaching doctrine and knowledge but very little concerning knowing Christ as life in a practical way
The Lord said in John 12:24 that when a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it grows up and bears much fruit
If you visit the fundamentalist churches in the United States, there is for the most part no fruit and no impact
From this we can conclude that these churches are fundamental in their teachings but not in the experience of life
They have used this Bible to acquire knowledge with their minds, but they have remained on the line of knowledge
Since there is a lack of life among the Lord's children, it is very difficult for the proper government in the church to exist
Since the human body has life, the bones and tissues in the body form not an organization but an organism, a composition of life
If the church does not have enough life, the government of the church will become solely a matter of organization
Someone may be able to set up a very good system for governing the church, and this system may even seem to be very scriptural
The first thing needed for the government of a family is that the family members have life and that their life be proper and healthy
If both the children and the parents lacked the maturity in life, it would be impossible for them to have a proper family government
If all the members of a family are healthy and proper in terms of life, that family will have a proper government
If a family or a local church has both life and power, the government of that family or church will be wonderful
For a proper government to be established in a local church, the primary need of the saints in that locality is life
If we try to set up a government among the saints when they are too young, all we will be able to do is to organize them
If we allow the saints to mature in life, after they have matured to a certain extent, they will develop into an organism
We will need to do only a small amount of appointing and arranging, and a government will arise among them out from their growth in life
If we desire to have a sound government in a strong local church, we should stress the matter of the growth in life
If we read these twenty-two books carefully, we will see that the government of the church is the outworking of the growth in life
If we desire to have a strong local church with a sound government, we must experience the crucified and resurrected Christ
If the saints in a locality have the adequate growth in life, it will be easy for them to have the proper church government
If all the members of a family gradually grow in life and are healthy, that family will spontaneously have a family government
Based upon their growth in life, some of the brothers and sisters will automatically rise up to serve the saints
Those who spontaneously begin to serve others based upon their growth in life are the real serving ones, the real deacons
Perhaps one member of a family develops into a good cook, and another member of the family develops into a good sewer
If we follow the Lord's way revealed in the Bible-the way of life-everything will be very simple, and we will receive the Lord's blessing
We must be inclusive of and open to all the Lord's children, and we must be inclusive of all spiritual matters
In particular, there are at least five items of which we must be inclusive-life, the truth, the church, the gospel, and power
Some other groups are opposed to the teachings of the Brethren, considering their teachings to be merely dead teachings
After being with us for one day, they would say, 'You people are very much like those in the Pentecostal movement'
After being with us for a few more weeks, they would change their mind and say, 'You people are very much like the Brethren'
After another month they might see a baptism among us, and then they would say, 'Actually, you are just like the Baptists'
It has been blessed because it is not closed to any of the Lord's children or to anything good that is from the Lord
If we are going to stress anything, we must stress Christ as life and everything to us and the church as the expression of Christ
Many of us may have experienced some of the Pentecostal things, but we should never say that we are only Pentecostal
Surely we must give heed to the experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, but we should not stress this too much
Everything is for Christ and the church, including justification, sanctification, and the baptism in the Holy Spirit
If we are genuinely inclusive of all the Lord's children and of all the good things that are of the Lord, we will be blessed by the Lord
In the 1700s some of the dear saints who were in the Lord's recovery began to pay attention to the church life
Under his leadership they began to practice the church life, and to some extent it was proper and even quite wonderful
The practice of the church life by the brothers in Bohemia was good, but the Lord desired to do something more
These brothers in England were very inclusive of all the positive things that the Lord had recovered before them
Moody of America were both evangelical giants in the nineteenth century, but neither of them were in the Brethren movement
Both the recovery of the inner life and the recovery of the preaching of the gospel were reactions to the Brethren movement
The Lord responded by recovering the line of the inner life, the preaching of the gospel, and the power of Pentecost
By the Lord's mercy and grace we have been practicing to take this way through the ministry of Watchman Nee for more than thirty-five years
You do not need to come here to build up the Methodist church or the Presbyterian church; simply join with us'
Answer: From the Scriptures and from our experience, we have seen that there are two places in which we should have the meetings
Question: If there are thirty-seven district meetings, how do all of the saints know where they are supposed to meet?
As a result, the brothers and sisters are hesitant to preach the gospel because they already have so many children
When there is a proper government, there will be the presence of the Lord, and everyone will respect the presence of the Lord
Today those who rebel against God's government will face a similar fate in that they will become spiritually dead
A proper church is like a factory, where we learn to work and manufacture and can practice what we have been taught
In such an all-inclusive environment, the members who are gifted will gradually be manifested and will begin to minister
In order for a local church to have a good beginning, there is a need for a nucleus of saints to stay in a certain place to lay a foundation
In the church life it is easy for some to be trained both practically and in life to become ministers for the Lord
The right way to produce gifted ones is not through Bible institutes or seminaries; the right way is through the church
Those who come into the church in the Far East learn a great deal of the truth because we have many different studies in the church
Sometimes we study a book of the Bible, sometimes we study a particular topic, and at other times we study a special line of truth
When the Lord was thirty years old, He came forth to serve the Lord, but before He began His service, He was baptized in water
For the first thirty years of His life before He received the baptism in the Holy Spirit, the Lord was surely living with God and before God
We cannot say that prior to receiving the baptism in the Spirit, the Lord did not have the fullness of the divine life
Regrettably, many Christians today confuse these matters, thinking that the baptism in the Spirit is something related to life
He was a teacher and was well educated, and he came to the Lord Jesus with the intention of obtaining some teachings
The Lord said to Nicodemus, 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit'
The Lord's answer indicates that apart from regeneration, flesh can never be changed into something other than flesh
Only by being born of the Spirit could Nicodemus be changed into something other than flesh, that is, into spirit
Our present need is not to receive some form of religion, knowledge, or teaching but to be regenerated by the Spirit of God
In John 6 the Lord performed a miracle by feeding more than five thousand people with only five barley loaves and two fish
In addition to telling His followers that He was the bread of life, the Lord said, 'He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me'
We must realize, however, that without the Lord Himself as the living One, neither Christianity nor its teachings profit us
He said that although He was going to leave them physically, He would return to be with them spiritually, that is, as the Spirit
As the Spirit He would not only return to be with His disciples; He would also enter into them to dwell in them and to be one with them
We received our human life from our parents, but through regeneration we have received another life-the divine life
After receiving Christ as our life, our second need is to learn to feed on Christ day by day by contacting Him as the Spirit in our spirit
Just as a baby needs milk to feed on after it is born, we need to feed on Christ after we have been born of God with the life of God
It is not enough to go to the meetings of the church, to listen to messages, and to read the Word with our mind
Whether we are reading, meditating, praying, or singing, we must exercise our spirit to contact the Lord as the Spirit
If you contact the Lord as the Spirit by exercising your spirit, you will be refreshed, satisfied, and strengthened by the Lord
Your whole inner being-spirit, mind, emotion, will, conscience, and heart-will be saturated with Christ, making you a Christ-man
Bearing fruit is not the result of human effort; it is the overflow of the life within, which is Christ Himself
As we abide in Him and allow Him to abide in us, He will fill us with Himself as life and will flow out of us as living water
The purpose of God is that Christ would be mingled with us so that we would be filled, possessed, and saturated with Christ and by Christ
Corinthians 4:7 says, 'We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us'
Since we were created to be vessels to contain God, we must ask how God comes into us and how we can receive Him
In God's wisdom, when He created man, He created man with many different organs to receive many different things
Once you received it with your hand, you could receive the information contained in it with your eyes and your mind
From these verses we can see that the Spirit of God dwells within us that we have the Spirit of Christ and that Christ Himself is within us
Since Gods eternal purpose is to work Himself into us we need to see how we can be saturated with Christ and possessed by Him in a full way
Christ today is the Spirit , we human beings have a human spirit , and as the Spirit, Christ is dwelling within us in our spirit
The fact that Christ is within our spirit cannot be a mere doctrine teaching or Christian slogan to us it must be our fact and our reality
We all must praise the Lord that He is within us and that because He is within us, we have the way to enjoy and experience Him
When our inner man is renewed and we live in the new man Christ becomes everything within us because Christ is all and in all in the new man
We should cooperate with the Lord's work and pray to the Father that He would strengthen us with power into our inner man
For the accomplishment of this intention, God created man as a vessel and gave man a spiritual organ to receive God Himself into him
Since God's intention is to work Christ into our being, we must see the way for us to cooperate with this intention
By our living in our new man, Christ will be able to work Himself into our entire being until He is all and in all in us
Whatever we say concerning this mysterious topic must be based upon two things-the revelation in the Scriptures and our experience
Next to the word God in Genesis 1:1 he put three horizontal lines, indicating that the number of the Hebrew word for God is plural
The fact that the subject God is plural and the verb created is singular reveals that God is triune, or three-one
Although the Bible clearly reveals that there is one God, God Himself repeatedly refers to Himself in the plural number
In Numbers 6 the Lord spoke to Moses regarding the way in which Aaron and his sons were to bless the children of Israel
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ'
The Bible reveals that God is three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-but this does not mean that there are three Gods
The Bible clearly states that God is one, and there are several verses that join the three of the Godhead together
While Isaiah 9:6 and John 14:8-9 reveal that the Son is the Father, 2 Corinthians 3:17 unveils that the Son is the Spirit
In these verses the One who will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel is Jehovah, but this One is also sent by Jehovah
In John 5 the Lord repeatedly declared that He had been sent by the Father , and in Isaiah 9:6 we see that the Son is the Father
Our experience also shows us that it is impossible to separate the Father from the Son or the Lord from the Spirit
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
Another mystery in the Scriptures is the relationship between eternal salvation and God's judgment of His children
If it were possible for us to lose our salvation through wrongdoing, salvation would have something to do with works
Although this brother had committed a serious sin, Paul says that he would still be saved in the day of the Lord
Verse 14 continues, 'If anyone's work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward'
Verse 15 follows, 'If anyone's work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire'
If we do not live according to the will of God and according to Christ, the Lord will cause us to suffer loss when He returns
There is, however, another judgment spoken of in the Bible that does pertain to believers-the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ
When Christ returns, He will set up His judgment seat, and all His disciples will be brought there to be judged
The apostle Paul was one who lived with a view to the judgment seat of Christ and who endeavored to obtain the reward
All the children of Israel were saved by the passover and crossed through the Red Sea, but not all of them entered into Canaan
In light of this warning, the apostle Paul tells us that he was running the race and striving to obtain the prize
Paul also told Timothy that this reward was not for himself alone but for all those who love the Lord's appearing and coming
At the moment we believe in the Lord, we receive salvation, and once we are saved, we can never lose our salvation
On the one hand, there is eternal security; on the other hand, there is the settlement of the Lord's righteousness
Those who run successfully will receive a reward, a prize; those who do not will suffer loss and will be punished
We can illustrate the relationship between salvation and reward with the experience of a father and his children
Although the father may punish the child who does not do well, this does not mean that this child is no longer one of the father's children
He will, however, measure out some kind of punishment and cause us to suffer loss if we do not live according to His regulations
It deals with our justification, our redemption, our salvation, and our sanctification, that is, our deliverance from the nature of sin
The last point unveiled in chapter 12 is that all of the saved and sanctified ones are the many members of the one Body of Christ the church
The very last matter mentioned in the entire Scriptures is the holy city, the New Jerusalem, which is built with precious stones
God's enemy will allow the Lord's children to do almost anything except to build up the genuine, living church
The Lord has given the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers for the building up of the Body
What we see in the Christian world today is not the building but many gifted persons who are individual, spiritual giants
Most physical buildings are formed not of one large piece of special material but of many ordinary pieces of material
In the New Testament age Peter John and Paul were great apostles yet what they built up was not their own ministries but the local churches
The apostle John was the last of the great apostles and was very experienced, spiritual, and successful in his ministry
The testimony of the Lord is with the local churches because the local churches are the genuine expressions of the Body of Christ
Our work in China and Taiwan during the past thirty years has been to build up the local churches, not to build up anyone's ministry
The more we worked in Taiwan, the more the church was in the brothers' hands, because we were building the church, not our own ministry
Although most ministers today take the direction of building up their ministry, the right direction is to build up the local churches
When we work with the goal of building up the local churches, our work is prevailing because we bring all the saints into function
On the other hand, if we build up our own ministry or keep the church in our own hands, we will at the very least hinder the building work
Those who attended their churches felt like they had to help that particular missionary and honor him by going to his church
They take the responsibility of building up the church and feel that the church is their home, their house, which they must care for
The Lord's mind, thought, intention, and heart are for the Body, the church, and the building up of the local churches in various places
On the other hand, if the members of my body were detached, the impact would be gone; there would be only a heap of bones
They are all seeking their personal interests, personal salvation, personal victory, and personal healing, blessing, and spirituality
Though they may be very spiritual, they cannot be satisfied apart from the genuine church, the genuine building up of the Body
Once they see the building of the church and enter into it, they feel satisfied and realize that this is what they were seeking
We must experience Christ as our life and our everything, and we must have the church as the expression of Christ
In the Old Testament when Absalom drove his father David away from Jerusalem, some people prepared the way for David to return
Similarly, there is the need for some prevailing churches on the earth to prepare the way for the Lord to come back
In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord sounds the call for the overcomers, the remnant
Question: Many Christians whom we contact come to the recovery for the blessings but simultaneously remain in their own denominations
When they need the Lord, they come here, but their money, work, and effort go to their particular denominations
It is good and even necessary to pay attention to other experiences such as the experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit
Eve was a part of Adam, something that had come out of Adam; hence, she was Adam's counterpart, Adam's wife, and Adam's fullness
The blood was for redemption, and the water was for imparting Christ's resurrection life into His believers to produce the church
Eve was given back to Adam to be his counterpart; the church will eventually become Christ's eternal counterpart
Many Christians think that the new man is something individual, but the Scriptures reveal that the new man is corporate
When we bring the matter to the brothers and ask them to pray with us, we often break through after a single session of prayer
If you try to deal with this matter by yourself, you may try for many years and still be unable to overcome it
If you seek the baptism in the Holy Spirit together with the brothers in the church, it will be easy for you to obtain this experience
We all need to see that we are a part of the church, which is the fullness of Christ, the Body of Christ, and the new man
Since we are a part of the church, the new man, we must put on the new man by entering into the real church life
In addition to seeing all these aspects of the church, we must see that we are part of the church and that we must live the church life
These verses reveal that the Lord who is the Spirit is living, dwelling, working, moving, and acting in our spirit
Psalm 51:6 says, 'Behold, You delight in truth in the inward parts; / And in the hidden part You would make known wisdom to me'
We may be very clear about the outward parts of our physical body, but we may not know much about our inward parts
It is very important for us to discern our spirit and to realize that our spirit is different from our soul, heart, mind, emotion, and will
To understand the difference between these two, we need to know the function of the heart and the function of the spirit
Just as our heart is the organ that we use to love a book, our heart is also the organ that we use to love the Lord
He gave us a new heart so that we could love Him, and He put a new spirit within us so that we could receive Him into us
The Scriptures reveal that the heart is composed of four parts-the conscience, the mind, the emotion, and the will
The mind emotion and will which are all parts of the heart are also the three parts that make up the soul that is the natural life the self
If we desire to know the Lord and to follow Him, we should not endeavor to do so according to our mind, emotion, or will
It is critical for us to learn to discern our spirit and to know the difference between our spirit and our mind, emotion, and will
Often, however, while we are having such fellowship, we suddenly exercise our mind and begin to think about or remember something
In our mind we are not happy with this brother, and the more we think about him, the more we want to give him up
Are you going to go along with your own desire in your emotion, or are you going to go along with your innermost part, your spirit'?
One time he made the decision to go to a certain place to work, even though we all felt that it was not the Lord's will for him to do so
We must be simple and must deny our mind, emotion, and will in order to follow the feeling in the deepest part of our being
When we go along with our spirit and follow the sense in our spirit, there will be a result-Christ will make His home in our hearts
We may know that we need to be filled with the Lord and transformed into His image, but how can this take place?
