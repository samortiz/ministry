Otherwise, everything will be in vain. This does not mean that the works of Peter and Paul are not needed, but at the present time, the urgent need is not for outward things. We must first have the inward reality; then we can have the outward things. We should realize and understand that the net has been broken. The fish can no longer be kept in the net. Therefore, God wanted John to mend this net. He did not patch on something new or invented. Instead, it was there from the beginning. This is why he said, "What I give to you is what you have known already." It was not something they did not know, but something that they knew and had forgotten.</P><P>What is it to mend? Mending is not replacing the broken net with a new one, but restoring the broken one to its original condition. In other words, mending is covering the hole with a piece of the original material. Today we mainly need to return to God, gain life and spiritual power, and learn to overcome the world and the enemy. This is a spiritual reality. We need to take hold of John's testimony first. Then we can go back to the testimony of Paul and then Peter. If we do not come back to John first, we will not be able to come back to Peter. Since the net has been broken, how can we use it for catching fish? This is why we have to mend the net first by holding onto the reality, before we can do anything else.</P><P>Finally, let us pay attention to three verses in particular. "Another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go" (John 21:18). This is the way the Lord Jesus spoke concerning Peter's end. Peter was such a brave and strong person! According to tradition, he was put on a cross upside down for the Lord's sake. How brave he was! But what did the Lord say? He said that Peter would be bound and taken to a place where he did not want to go. Eventually, the Catholic Church declared that he had been a pope. They say that He sat on a throne in Rome. A huge edifice has the name "St. Peter's Cathedral" written on it. Throughout history, many great persons have flattered, exalted, and applauded him! But would Peter have wanted to be treated in this manner? He would have been extremely unhappy and unwilling. He could never have imagined that he would have been so glorified today. He would never have sat on such a great throne. But he has no say in this matter; he has been bound by the people. His sovereignty has been usurped by nations and individuals. His testimony has been completely buried by them. O brothers! How many people today know that Peter has been bound? They consider salvation to only be liberating and joyful thing. Salvation is truly liberating and joyful. But salvation is not for the enjoyment of pleasure, or to do things according to one's own choice. Rather, it is being subject to God's authority. Only when a person is subject to God's authority will everything be right.</P><P>Let us consider Paul's end. "And he remained two whole years in his own rented dwelling" (Acts 28:30). His life ended in a worse manner than Peter's. He even had to rent a house for himself. He could have lived in Ephesus or Corinth. But he had to rent a house because he had no permanent place of his own. His testimony was rejected, and he had to stay in his rented house and not come out. Previously, Paul could go somewhere and find someone to preach to, but now people had to go to his place. Unless they had a heart to go, they could never hear his preaching. Whether or not they believed, Paul could not bother them any longer. They had to make their own choice. Paul was pushed down by men in high positions and kept in a prison in Rome. People had to seek him out personally before they could see his face. Many people today can only recite the "Lord's Prayer" and the creeds of the denominations. But these are "their own houses"; they are not Paul's house. It is not enough to merely have some mint and anise outwardly (Matt. 23:23). We have to dig into the true meaning of Paul's Epistles. The Epistles to the Corinthians were not just for the Corinthians, but for all the churches. Oh! Paul is covered up by men and cannot come out any longer. Let us look for him quickly and seek the truth of his testimony. Do not allow this testimony to pass by in a vague way. I want to say an honest word: all those who do not want to make the effort will never find Paul. Those who do not pay a price will never find the truth.</P><P>Finally, let us come to John. He was exiled to an island. What is an island? An island is different from a sea and also different from land. It is not the sea because it is isolated in the sea, nor is it land because it is not connected to the mainland. It is separated not only from the sea but also from land. It is a solitary place. What is the sea? The sea is the world! The land is today's human religion and organization! An island is not connected to either of them. God is not in the world; neither is He in great human organizations. The best achievements of man are just a big piece of land. God put John on an island, not in the world or in a human organization. Instead, He put him on an island. Was he lonely there? Surely he was lonely! He had neither the joy of the world as a surging tide, nor the secure peace of the land. He surely was very lonely. But John was marvelously touched by the Spirit on the Lord's Day; he saw a great vision, heard the Lord Jesus' voice, and was caught up to the heavens. What a wonderful thing! Though he did not have the joy of the sea or the comfort of land, he had the Lord's comfort and was satisfied. No one connected to the sea and the land is able to be connected to the Lord. If a Christian treasures his position and reputation in religion, he will never go to an island.</P><P>O brothers and sisters! The Lord is calling for us to go to the island. He wants us to give up all the outward things willingly and come to Him alone. On the island there is no ship to take us out to sea, nor a bridge for us to cross to the land. But the Holy Spirit will carry us away. There are no exits on any side, but the way upward is clear. If the way upward is not clear, you will need ships to go on the sea or bridges to go to the land. If you have these other ways, you can never stay on the island or be caught up to the heavens. Oh! We should go back to John first and stand on reality. Then we can go back to the works of Peter and Paul. We need to learn how to be on the island, in the house, and bound. May the Lord bless us.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
