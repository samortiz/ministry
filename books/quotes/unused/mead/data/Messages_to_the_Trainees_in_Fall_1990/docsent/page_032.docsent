   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE NOT QUENCHING THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Thessalonians 5:19 says, "Do not quench the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Romans 12:11 Paul said, "Not slothful in zeal, burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may be cold, but the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, within us is not cold or idle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, He is burning within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Timothy 1:6 says, "For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The divine Spirit is burning within us, but this burning may not be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, Paul tells us not to quench the burning, but to fan it into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>NOT QUENCHING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>BY STANDING WITH THE DIVINE FACTS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As genuine Christians we have several divine facts before us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, we have repented and believed in the Lord, and we have received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if we neglect or forget this, it is still a fact which cannot be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is also a fact that our human spirit has been regenerated and that the Lord Jesus as the divine Spirit is now in our spirit John 3:6; 2 Cor 3:17; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should count on these divine facts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not trustworthy, but we do have One within us who is altogether trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may be cold, but He is never cold.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is burning and working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is never a time when the Lord is not working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not think that as Christians who love the Lord we are hot, while the Lord Himself is cold and needs to be stirred up by us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord does not need to be stirred up by us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, He is already burning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We simply should not quench Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may consider that to be filled with the Spirit involves an ecstatic, exciting feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not need to pray in an extraordinary way to be stirred up and filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The disciples in the early church were living, worshipping, attending the meetings, and working in a normal way, being filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our Lord's Day morning meetings everyone may not be excited, but many function in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what it means to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not seek an ecstatic feeling or anything spectacular.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To do so will quench the burning within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The New Testament does not charge us to seek an ecstatic experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, it charges us to be sober-minded Titus 1:8; 2:2, 5, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Seeking a spectacular experience may be coMpared to starting a fire with too much fuel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When lighting a fire, it is best to start with a small burning and then feed it with some fuel as it is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should simply learn not to quench the burning within our spirit, but to fan it and feed it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some among us have been ecstatic in their experience of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At a later time, however, they may not have experienced the Lord for a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must stand with the fact that we have a mingled spirit and that we have the Lord Jesus within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not be excited, but rather fan the flame in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this we need to pray, call on the name of the Lord, read the Word, and pray-read a few verses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we will grow and be consistent in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not be too "hot" or stir other people up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Stirring people up may be compared to making artificial flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many artificial flowers can be made in a short time, but they are not real, living plants.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the saved believers, we have the Spirit of life within us, and we must grow in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, patience is needed for the growth in life.</S>
