   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Those Hungry and Thirsty</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for Righteousness to Be Satisfied</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 6 the Lord said, Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Righteousness here is to be right in our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This righteousness is related to what we are inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is indicated by the fact that we are told to hunger and thirst for righteousness so that we might be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to understand verse 6 we must also consider verse 20.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 20 says, For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verses 3 and 20 we see two aspects of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 3 the verb is present tense, and in verse 20 it is future tense.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, the kingdom of the heavens is ours; on the other hand, we shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are poor in our spirit, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is ours today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we still need to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Remember the two aspects of the kingdom of the heavens: the reality in the church today and the manifestation in the upper part of the millennium in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are truly poor in our spirit, seeking after Christ, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then at the time of the millennium we shall enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, in order to enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens we need the surpassing righteousness, the righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to hunger and thirst for this righteousness, to seek after such righteousness, that we may enter into the kingdom of the heavens vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>6, 10, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we hunger and thirst for righteousness, God will grant us to be satisfied with the very righteousness we seek.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we seek this surpassing righteousness, it will be given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Righteousness is to be right not only with God, but also with man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees was rather low because it was the righteousness according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our righteousness must not be according to the old law, but according to the new law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we shall see, the new law is much higher than the old.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The old law says, You shall not murder.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the new law says, Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment v. 22 . By this one example we see that our righteousness must be on a higher level than the righteousness of the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must take care not only of not murdering, but even of not being angry with our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This righteousness is on the highest plane.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our natural life is not able to attain this righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This inward subjective righteousness must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only Christ can fulfill the requirements of the new law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I read Matthew 5 as a young man, I was disappointed and said, I simply can t make it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I ll just have to quit, But the more I have grown, the more I have come to realize that I can make it because I have a life within me that can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The King with His kingdom within me can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, this King needs our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cooperate by being hungry and thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cooperate by saying, O Lord Jesus, I hunger and thirst after You.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lord, I want to be filled with You.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you hunger and thirst in this way, you will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The righteousness in verse 6 is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is the surpassing righteousness, the righteousness on the highest plane, that can only be attained by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because He is the One who produces this highest righteousness, we must seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to pray, Lord, make me hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Grant me an appetite for Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Grant me the appetite to seek the surpassing righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you seek righteousness in this way, you will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You will receive what you have been seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>E. The Merciful to Receive Mercy</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 7 says, Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be righteous is to give one what he deserves, whereas to be merciful is to give someone better than he deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For the kingdom of the heavens, we need to be not only righteous, but also merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To receive mercy is to get better than we deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are merciful to others, the Lord will grant us mercy 2 Tim 1:16, 18 , especially at His judgment seat James 2:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be righteous is to deal with yourself in a strict way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must be righteous in dealing with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not give ourselves any excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Toward others, however, we must be merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we are diligent to seek the surpassing righteousness, we shall eventually become merciful toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In our seeking we shall find that our natural man is weak and that we are prone to failure.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you do not realize the pitiful condition of your natural man, you will never have mercy on others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead of showing mercy to them, you will condemn them when they fail or fall.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The reason you condemn them is that you do not know yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you know yourself, whenever someone fails, you will say, Lord, have mercy on me and on my brother.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all are weak vessels and cannot fulfill Your requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Lord, even though my brother has offended me, I would still be merciful toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you have never failed, you will never be merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you are always successful in your pursuit of holiness and perfection, you will have no sympathy toward others when they fail.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You will always condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But if you know how weak you are and how many mistakes you have made, you will be merciful to others.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is a promise for us in verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The promise is that those who are merciful will receive mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you judge your brother without mercy today, you will not receive any mercy at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because you judge others unmercifully, Christ will judge you unmercifully.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if you have mercy on your brother, the Lord will have mercy on you at His judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, the kingdom people are strict in dealing with themselves, but very merciful in dealing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Once again, this is not an outward matter, but a matter related to our inward being.</S>
