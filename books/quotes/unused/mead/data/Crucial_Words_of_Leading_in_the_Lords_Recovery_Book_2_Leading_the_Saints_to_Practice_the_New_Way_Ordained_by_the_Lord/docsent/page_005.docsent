   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ELDERS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ALSO BEING PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The elders carried out the administration among the children of Israel not only according to the set law but also by means of God s instant revelation through the breastplate, the Urim, and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The priests received the Ten Commandments and taught them to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They also brought the Urim and the Thummim into God s presence to receive God s instant revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two kinds of ministry were both carried out by the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament there was an eldership related to carrying out God s administration and a priesthood related to ministering God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament, however, these two bodies have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every saved person in the New Testament is a priest 1 Pet 2:5; Rev 1:6 , and the elders are simply the more mature and experienced ones among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are both elders and priests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>An elder must be one who has rich experiences of life in regard to spiritual matters and must also be mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, he must be a priest who draws near to God and has contact with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as the high priest in the Old Testament was able to read the condition of the twelve tribes of Israel through the breastplate, an elder must know not only the law of God but also have the breastplate and be able to receive God s instant revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that an elder must constantly draw near to God, bearing God s people on his shoulders and embracing them on his breast in order to bring them into God s light and read them like the letters of the alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes a certain one may become dark, and later another one may become dark.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way, he can read God s will for God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that an elder must be one who is experienced in life and able to bear responsibility for God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the same time, he must have a heart that cares for God s people and be a person who draws near to God, fellowships with God, is in the light of His countenance, and is able to read every member in the church according to God s view.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will enable him to receive God s instant revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>CONDITIONS FOR BEING AN ELDER</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have the set law, the New Testament, which is composed of twenty-seven books containing over two hundred chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The New Testament is quite comprehensive in its contents.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although it is so complete, some matters are still not spoken of in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may be referred to in principle but not in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, an elder must first read the New Testament carefully and understand the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, an elder must be a New Testament priest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Old Testament, elders and priests were separate; in the New Testament, these two groups of people have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today an elder must also be a priest, one who draws near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He not only needs to know the law of God, the entire New Testament; he also needs to bear God s people on his shoulders, hold them in his bosom, draw near to God, and read the genuine condition of every saint by means of God s light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through this kind of reading, he will receive the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is what it means to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The principle seen in the Old Testament still applies in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Elders must first have experiences in life and be those who draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They need to not only understand the law of God but also see the revelation of God; moreover, they need to have a definite way to seek God for His instant revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way is to bear all the saints on their shoulders and to embrace all the saints in their bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes when an elder encounters a great difficulty, he thinks that it would be better for him to quit and discontinue his service.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that he has God s people on his shoulders but not in his bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such an elder will be unable to read God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because the twenty-two letters are on the breast, not on the shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To wear the letters on the breast is to love and care for the brothers and sisters and to remember them in one s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Often a mother gives others the feeling that she is more loving than the father, whereas the father usually gives others the feeling that he is stern and is often involved in discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, when children face great matters in life, they usually listen to the mother, not the father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is because only the mother bears the children on her shoulders and holds them in her bosom; a mother wears both the shoulder plates and the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I still remember when I first graduated from college and found a job that required proficiency in English, which was exactly what I had studied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the job was on an island some distance from my hometown, I had to prepare myself to leave home.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time, I was already an adult of more than twenty years, and I knew how to take the boat and find my way there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nevertheless, my elderly mother still worried about me and hired a rickshaw in order to follow me to the pier.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The boat could not be anchored along the shore because the water was too shallow; thus, a sampan carried the passengers to the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After my mother saw that both my luggage and I were properly taken care of, she stood on the bank and said to me, A mother is anxious when her son goes on a journey, but a son does not worry when his mother goes on a journey.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Her words left me with a deep impression.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She wanted me to know that her heart would follow me while I was far away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Mothers make wonderful priests because they not only bear their children on their shoulders but also hold them in their bosoms.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When mothers enter into the presence of God to read the condition of their children, they become very clear about their children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The elders also should be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some elders are not like mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It seems that they are forced to be elders, and they feel deeply that it would be best if they could break away from being an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes not only they have such a thought, but even those around them pour cold water on them, telling them that there is nothing good about being an elder and that it is full of troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Such elders serve under compulsion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although they bear the saints on their shoulders, they do not have them in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whether or not an elder is able to sleep peacefully when the church or a certain brother or sister is experiencing problems tests the manner in which he bears the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If he is able to sleep peacefully, there is no breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If the breastplate is present, he will be unable to sleep peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we are bearing and holding the brothers and sisters, we will be wonderful priests, and in God s light we will be able to read God s leading concerning the brothers and sisters whom we hold in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is how God takes care of the administration of His people throughout the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this administration priests expound the law and use the breastplate to receive God s instant leading.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, the priests in the Old Testament did not have the eldership and thus could not administrate.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the same way, today not every saint can bear the responsibility of the administration.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There were many priests in the Old Testament age, but there were not as many elders.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This means that among the saints everyone is a priest, but only a few are elders.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, brothers who are elders must see that in God s New Testament economy the elders are a unique group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Every saved one should be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Elders, on the contrary, are a minority.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only those who are mature in the experiences of life are qualified to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Their maturity is not in regard to their physical life but in regard to their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must know that, spiritually speaking, not everyone is mature; only a small number are relatively mature.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is not an absolute matter but a relative matter.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Even though it is a relative matter, only a small number of people are mature.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>For example, out of a hundred people, only a dozen may be relatively mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Because others have not yet grown to the same extent, these ones begin to take the lead and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These are the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Being a priest is not a matter of being young or mature; as long as a person is born into a priestly family, he is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, being an elder depends on how much one has grown in life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>For instance, in the Old Testament, all those of the family of Aaron were born priests.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>However, not all were elders.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the entire tribe of Aaron, only a few were elders.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Out of two or three million men, plus women and children, only seventy elders are spoken of in Exodus 24.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Hence, in terms of the administration in God s economy, the elders are the most important group.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We can say this because there were more priests than elders in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The condition is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Every saved one in all the churches is a priest, yet there is a lack of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There is no requirement in regard to the life and age of a priest, but an elder must be mature and experienced in life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Everyone is able to come before God to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>For example, yesterday a brother was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>As soon as he came out from the baptistery, he immediately prayed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As soon as he began praying, he began to function as a priest; nevertheless, he is not able to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>To be an elder is a matter of growth in life within the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We may use another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>There may be twenty newly saved brothers and sisters in a newly established local church.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Several months later there may be a need to appoint elders among them.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>At that time it will be necessary to see who among them has grown the most and who are the most mature.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>As far as the priesthood is concerned, everyone can be a priest, but as far as the eldership is concerned, only the most mature in life are qualified to be elders.</S>
