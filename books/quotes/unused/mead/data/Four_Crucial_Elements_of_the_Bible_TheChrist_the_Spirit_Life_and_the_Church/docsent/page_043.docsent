   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John 4:24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is Spirit; therefore, when we worship Him, we must worship in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is Spirit, and He created a spirit for man that man may worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Animals and plants do not have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only human beings have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Zechariah 12:1</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Zechariah 12:1b says, "Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse speaks of three things created by God: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In God's eyes there are three important items in the universe: the stretching forth of the heavens, the laying of the foundations of the earth, and the forming of the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse does not speak of the heavens, the earth, and man but the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In God's view this spirit is as important as the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Human Spirit Being for Containing and Worshipping God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have a mouth and a stomach in our body to contain food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without food we humans cannot exist.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, what God considers most important in our being is not our physical organs or psychological faculties but our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our spirit is our spiritual "stomach" to contain God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life and that He who eats Him will live because of Him John 6:48, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can we eat Him, and where is He after we eat Him?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We receive Him with our spirit into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God created man with a mouth and a stomach for man's physical existence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the same time, He also created a spirit for man to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that God is Spirit and that when we worship and contact Him, we must be in our spirit and exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Secrets of Exercising Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One of the secrets of exercising our spirit is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may consider calling on the name of the Lord as the best secret of exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, the secret of exercising our feet is to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For walking, we use our feet; for seeing, we use our eyes; for hearing, we use our ears; and for praying, we use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we pray, we need to use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some may have the feeling that when they pray they are often in their mind and not in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praying in spirit requires much exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This may be likened to a child learning to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before he can walk, he must first learn to crawl and later to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After he can stand, then he learns to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once he learns to walk, he no longer needs to crawl or hold on to something.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps when you first start to pray, you are in your mind; but after much practice in praying, you will gradually be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After further practice, you will reach a point that whenever you pray, you pray in your spirit and with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Prayer is not just for petitioning God but even more for contacting and fellowshipping with God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the best way to pray is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible even tells us to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only way to pray unceasingly is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Besides praying, we need to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Reading the Bible is not for gaining more knowledge and doctrines but for receiving spiritual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible contains profound truths that are not for the believers' objective knowledge but for their subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To dive into these profound truths, we need to use our spirit because the Lord said that His words are spirit and are life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To touch the spirit in the Lord's words, we need to use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we use our spirit, we dive into these profound truths, which are able to help open up our prayers, making them more penetrating and richer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether our prayers are deep and rich depends totally upon our knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, there are two secrets of exercising our spirit: prayer and pursuing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These two matters complement each other.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must pray, and we must also dive into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Praying can help us get into the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more we get into the truth, the deeper and richer our experiences will be.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even the sense we have when calling on the name of the Lord becomes deep, rich, and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way our taste and feeling for the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit will be very different from that in the past.</S>
