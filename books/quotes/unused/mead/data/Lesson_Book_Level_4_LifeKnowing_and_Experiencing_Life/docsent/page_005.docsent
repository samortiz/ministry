   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because God Himself is life, His life is His very self.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then what is life?</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Life is not different in the least from God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it were, then it would not be life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should understand this clearly.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we have God as our life we would not hate our enemies, rather we would love them Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We would not walk in darkness and do the hidden things of shame 2 Cor 4:2 ; rather we would walk in the light as He is in the light 1 John 1:7 .</S>
