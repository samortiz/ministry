<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD JESUS BEING OUR HIGH PRIEST</H2><P>Now we come to the eighth point. It is precious to know from the Bible that the Lord Jesus is our offering, but it is more precious to know that He is our High Priest. Many times I asked the brothers and sisters in various places what we would do if the Lord Jesus were not our Savior. Many said that we would be hopeless. If the Lord Jesus were not our Savior, we would be through; there would be no way for us to be saved. Then I asked what would happen if the Lord Jesus were not our High Priest. Many said that this would not make much difference. They think that it would not make much difference if the Lord Jesus were our High Priest or not. We have to know that there is not such a thing. We can keep our salvation only because the Lord Jesus is our High Priest before God. There is no need to mention the former sins or yesterday's sins. The sins that we have committed today alone are enough to cause us to perish. We can continue being saved only because the Lord Jesus is praying for us. The intercession of the Lord Jesus keeps us being saved. Hebrews 7:25 says, "Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him." Why can He do this? "Since He lives always to intercede for them." The Bible clearly tells us that the Lord Jesus is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him. Some people may tell us that we may lose our salvation or that we may still perish. If this were the case, where would you put the prayer of the Lord Jesus? God says that the Lord Jesus lives always to intercede for us. He continues to live to intercede for us.</P><P>Who can comprehend all the effectiveness of the intercession of the Lord Jesus for us? If we have a friend who is not saved and we pray for him, God can save him. How much more can the Lord Jesus, who is always before God interceding for us, keep us saved forever! Suppose you have a friend who fell away after believing in Jesus. You prayed for him and wrote letters to him with the hope that he would be a good Christian again. God heard your prayers. After a few years, he was revived. Now would not the continuing, eternal, and lasting prayer of God's Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is always before Him, be much more effective? Because the Lord Jesus is the perpetually living High Priest who intercedes for us before God, surely we will be saved by Him to the uttermost.</P><P>I am very happy about one thing. Others may forget to pray for me, but I am still a person being prayed for. Man can give up praying for me, but I am still a person being prayed for, because the Lord Jesus always prays for me. I have One who is the High Priest before God. Although man may forget, He never forgets. He lives perpetually as the High Priest to intercede for us.</P>
