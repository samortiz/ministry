   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Studying and Categorizing the Young Ones</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must have a clear view about the way we practice the brothers and sisters homes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For the homes we should keep the principle that we are a loving people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are trying to gain people, to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we should not regulate the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must study the way we take in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In education there are at least six levels: kindergarten, elementary school, middle or junior high school, high school, college, and graduate school.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We treat these six kinds of students in six different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What we exercise over the high schoolers, we should not exercise over the kindergarten students.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do, we may kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, what we practice with the kindergarten students, we should not practice with the elementary students.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to change our way or we will spoil them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No child under six likes to play mainly with adults.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They prefer to play with others who are under six.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even on the campus, those who labor there should not be too old.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they are too old, no one will come to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The students may run away because they are afraid of older people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A young man may feel uncomfortable with old men, but when someone his own age comes, he is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This illustrates that we cannot have the same regulation for people of different ages.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must classify people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should have some homes for those in their first year, and gradually we can advance from there up to the fourth year.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who have stayed with us for several years have been growing in the Lord, and they can now live a corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to prevent some from feeling superior or inferior when we classify them, we must do it wisely.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When parents raise their children, they exercise a certain way with each one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To open up a kindergarten is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The government has many regulations for nurseries and kindergartens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A nursery, for example, must care for the children s health and avoid contagious diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not take a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot avoid a feeling of superiority among the young people, just as the students in high school feel superior about being in high school.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we need spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to teach them to deny the self and many other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not easy, and it requires much study.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I would ask the brothers who set up the homes for the brothers and sisters to please reconsider the way we take.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot do things in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Educators know the psychology of students; they know the difference between kindergarten, elementary, junior high, high school, college, and graduate school.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must be careful in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>OUR NEED FOR FURTHER TRAINING AND LEARNING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I expect that I could have a further time with the elders to train them how to behave as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I take care of two annual trainings, and formerly I had to write thirty messages for thirty meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I also needed to travel much abroad, and recently I became ill due to traveling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, since I came to this country, I did not have much time to sit down with the elders to speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers who are elders in the United States are probing for the way to be good elders, but they do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not one of us was born knowing everything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we need to learn, practice, and be educated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even the two-year full-time training makes a big difference, but so many elders have not been trained.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I spoke of some of these things in The Elders Management of the Church, but I did not have the time to look into all these matters very much.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I now question whether management was the right word to use in that book.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our use of this word was also due to my lack of time to look into all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What does the elders management mean?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is not a bank or a corporation that needs a manager.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For practical reasons, we have a manager in the Living Stream Ministry office, but there is no rank in this office.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need very much fellowship so we can learn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is much profit for brothers from one part of the country to visit another, not to teach or merely to learn but simply to observe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Likewise, it is a big help to travel to another country and stay there for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way we can learn much.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have been traveling throughout the whole world, and I have learned much.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I truly learned something from the Japanese, and I learned something further from the Koreans.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should never merely be natives of our own country.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should try to go out and learn.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>THE NEED FOR SHEPHERDING,</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>ESPECIALLY BY CHERISHING</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To me, shepherding means everything for the brothers and sisters homes, for the vital groups, for the church, and for the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Christian teaching, nearly no one stresses this matter, but it is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord is not only our Shepherd and Overseer outwardly; He is also the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls 1 Pet 2:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have stressed this in the Crystallization-study of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today in the United States it is very hard to teach school.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even professors have to study how to shepherd their students.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If they do not shepherd them, they may have serious problems.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first point of shepherding is cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Ephesians 5 tells us that the Lord cherishes and nourishes the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Without cherishing, nourishing by itself does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today I handle things and do things very differently from the way I did thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Within these thirty years I have learned much, even related to dealing with my children.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are touching society, and we are touching human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is not a simple matter, so we must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We may do the work of the ministry, but the unfitting manner in which we behave and conduct ourselves kills our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Recently, a graduate student in a certain university attacked his three professors because they would not pass him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We cannot say that these professors were not responsible in part for this.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If they had spoken softly and wisely, their student would not have been provoked to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Those professors were trying their best to help this student, but the result was the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Many other professors who heard of this tragedy will now learn to be careful in dealing with students.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In principle, it is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The result, the issue, of our work very much depends on our way of conducting ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are taking care of the brothers and sisters homes, but how do we conduct ourselves, how do we behave, and what way do we take?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Even in caring for our children, if we are angry, we will provoke them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must not do that.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Ephesians is a very high book, but it comes down to say, Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we had written Ephesians, we may not have added this word.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We may have spoken only the high peaks in the first three and a half chapters of this book, but Paul came down from the high peaks in the second half of chapter four and chapters five and six.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>These portions are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Similarly, James says, The wrath of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>John 10 and 21 are chapters on shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Chapter ten speaks of the Lord s coming as the Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He is the Shepherd, and He is the door in and the door out to the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In 10:10 He says, I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly, and in verse 11 He says, I am the good Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He also says that He lays down His human life for the sake of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>To give life requires shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Without shepherding, it is hard for the divine life to work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Chapter twenty-one is a very important appendix on shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>John is a book on the divine life, but the divine life depends upon shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Even in our human life, family life, and marriage life there is the need of shepherding, and shepherding requires cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Husbands and wives need to cherish each other all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If a couple does not know how to cherish each other, they will have trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Parents also need to shepherd their children.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If shepherding could be practiced everywhere, the whole of society would become a utopia.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Misunderstandings and oppositions mainly come from the shortage of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We the co-workers must learn to cherish people.</S>
