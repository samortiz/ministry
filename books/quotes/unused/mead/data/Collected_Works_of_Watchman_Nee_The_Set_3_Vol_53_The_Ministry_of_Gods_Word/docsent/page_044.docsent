   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does it mean for God to reveal His Son in us?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot describe this; no one can describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even Paul could not describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can we tell whether or not a person has God's revelation in him?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some people can say that they have seen the revelation, whereas others are unable to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some are clear, but others remain unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We struggle, labor, think, and pursue, yet we still do not see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when God grants us mercy one day, our eyes are opened immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today we may pray to the Lord, "May You be my all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May You fill all and be all."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We pray this way, yet we do not know what this means.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We say what we do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God grants us mercy and reveals His Son in us, we will say spontaneously and effortlessly, "Thank God, He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All my past spiritual experiences are behind me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All my past works and pursuits are behind me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even my love, faith, righteousness, holiness, and victory are behind me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything but Christ is behind me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is everything."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only then can we say that He is over all and fills all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a fundamental revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is on the basis of this revelation that we seek to understand God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the starting point from which we seek to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We begin by knowing God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After this we proceed to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we go on in this way, everything will become transparent to us, and we will say, "I did not understand many things, but today I am beginning to understand them."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is where a man must learn to turn and become like an infant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He must learn to be like a child.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How does a child learn about a cow?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, he can have a book with the picture of a cow on the page and the word cow beside it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, he can be taken to see a cow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Which of these ways gives the child a more genuine understanding of the cow, a picture or a real-life cow?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The cow in the picture is only a few inches tall.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The child may think that a cow is only that tall.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you put him in front of the cow, however, his understanding will be different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose a child has seen a living cow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Within him there is an impression of something a cow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But he does not know what it is called.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now if you point out a cow to him in the book and tell him that it is called a cow, he will readily understand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His questions will be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should be like a little child.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May God cause us to know Christ at least once, to touch Him in a fundamental way at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we read the Bible again, everything will be clear and obvious to us; we will see everything through the light of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once the foundational experience is right, everything else will be right.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once this is established, everything else will be in place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everything will be related and linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you merely give a person a Bible and tell him the things contained in it, you will not get very far.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One brother studied many books on botany.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He read about a certain plant with a certain kind of leaf and flower.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He went up to the mountain in search of this plant but could not find it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is relatively easy to learn a word by looking at a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But it is not that easy to identify an object by comparing it to a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This brother tried to find the plant by the description in a book, but he could not find it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The same is true when it comes to identifying a man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is easier to look at a man first and then look at his picture.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It may not be easy for us to identify a person from his picture.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a very simple illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We find this experience among many children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We find this in Paul and Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One day God granted mercy to them, and they knew Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Himself said, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" Matt 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is entirely a matter of God's mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We know His Son because He has chosen to reveal Him to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>From the day we begin to know Him, we begin to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order to know the Bible, we have to know Christ first.</S>
