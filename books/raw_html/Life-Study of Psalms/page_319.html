<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE PRAISE OF THE SAINT<br>IN HIS GOING UP TO ZION CONCERNING<br>JEHOVAH'S BLESSING TO ISRAEL FROM ZION<br>AND THE PROSPERITY OF JERUSALEM<br>IN THEIR ENJOYMENT</H2><P>Psalm 128 is the praise of a saint in his going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's blessing to Israel from Zion (signifying the overcomers in the churches) and the prosperity of Jerusalem (signifying the church as God's kingdom) in their enjoyment. This indicates once again how precious are Zion and Jerusalem in the experiences and praises of the saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. They Eating the Labor of Their Hands,<br>and It Going Well with Them</H2><P>"Blessed is everyone who fears Jehovah,/Who walks in His ways./You will indeed eat the labor of your hands;/You will be blessed, and it will go well with you" (vv. 1-2). They will eat and they will have peace. Food and peace are two basic elements for our daily life. If we lack food, we will not have peace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Their Wives Being like Fruitful Vines,<br>and Their Children Being like Olive Shoots</H2><P>According to verse 3, their wives will be like fruitful vines in the innermost parts of their houses, and their children will be like olive shoots round about their tables. In this way will the man be blessed who fears Jehovah (v. 4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Blessing Them from Zion,<br>and They Seeing the Prosperity of Jerusalem</H2><P>Jehovah will bless them from Zion, and they will see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of their life. They will also see the children of their children under the peace of God upon Israel (vv. 5-6).</P>
