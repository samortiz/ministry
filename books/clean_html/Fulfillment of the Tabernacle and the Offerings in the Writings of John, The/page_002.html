<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WORD, THE TABERNACLE, THE LAMB OF GOD, THE DOVE, THE STONE, AND THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1-2, 14, 29, 36, 32, 42, 51</h1><p>This is the first of a series of messages on the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John. In giving these messages I take it for granted that you have read through all the messages in the Life-study of John. If you have not read those messages, I would encourage you to read them. Otherwise, certain matters that we shall cover in this series of messages may be puzzling to you.<h2 class=head1>THE TABERNACLE AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><p>These messages also assume some knowledge of the book of Exodus. Do you know what was the goal of the exodus of God’s people from Egypt? The goal was that the Lord would have a dwelling place on earth with a serving priesthood. Actually, the dwelling place and the priesthood are one. First Peter 2:5 says that we are “being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood.” This verse indicates that the spiritual house and the priesthood are one. Therefore, the priesthood is the building, and the building is the priesthood. In the typology in the book of Exodus we have two matters—the tabernacle and the priesthood. But in the New Testament fulfillment of these types, the building and the priesthood are one. The building is God’s spiritual house, and it is also a group of priests, a body of serving ones. Today, on the one hand, we are God’s dwelling place; on the other hand, we are a priesthood serving God. It is God’s goal to have this dwelling place, this priesthood. If we understand this, we shall be prepared to see the fulfillment of the types of the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the offerings in the writings of John.<h2 class=head1>EXTRACTS OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>As we proceed chapter by chapter through the Gospel of John, our concern will be with what we may call the extract of each chapter. We shall not study the chapters verse by verse. What is the extract of chapter one of John? An extract may be understood as a liquid extracted from a plant or other organic matter and that contains its essence in concentrated form. A synonym for extract is “spirit,” which is the essence of a substance extracted in liquid form, especially by distillation. Wine, for example, may be regarded as an extract, or spirit, of grapes. Whenever you extract the essence of a particular substance, you get the spirit of that substance. It is not our purpose in these messages to repeat the Life-study of the Gospel of John. Our purpose is to see what is the extract, the spirit, of each chapter. In this message we shall consider the extract of John chapter one.<p>Many teachers and expositors say that the first eighteen verses of John 1 are a prologue, an introduction, to the entire Gospel. This understanding is correct. However, after further study of this Gospel, we have come to realize that all of chapter one is an introduction or prologue to the Gospel of John. Often the introduction to a book is actually an extract of the book, for it usually gives the reader a brief outline of the book as a whole. Such an outline is the extract of the book. In chapter one of the Gospel of John we have an extract of the substance of the following twenty chapters.<p>The extract of John 1 includes six matters: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the dove, the stone, and the house of God. John 1:51 says, “And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.” This refers to Jacob’s dream of a ladder with angels ascending and descending on it. Jacob called the name of the place where he had that dream Bethel, which means the house of God. In the first chapter of John, we see the Word (1:1), the tabernacle (1:14), the Lamb of God (1:29), the dove, which is a symbol of the Spirit (1:32), the stone (1:42), and the building, the house of God, Bethel (1:51). The first of these six items, the Word, is found in verse 1, and the last, the house of God, Bethel, in verse 51. In between we have the tabernacle, the Lamb of God, the dove, and the stone. In verse 51 we see the ladder that joins heaven to earth, and earth to heaven. This is the house of God, Bethel. These six matters are the extract of John 1.<p>You may have read this chapter through many times without seeing this extract. If some were asked what chapter one of John talks about, they may say, according to their experience, that this chapter tells us that all those who have received Christ have been given the authority to become children of God, those who are born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (vv. 12-13). This, of course, is a wonderful matter. Others may say that John 1 reveals that the Lord Jesus is the Lamb of God. However, not many readers of the Gospel of John have seen as a whole the six matters of the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the dove, the stone, and the house. We need to be deeply impressed that the extract of John 1 includes these six matters.
