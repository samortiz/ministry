<h2 class="head1">THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARENTS</h2>
<p>Apart from the book of Proverbs, the Old Testament does not seem to give us much teaching concerning parenting. In the New Testament, however, Paul wrote something about being parents. Most books in the world teach children how to be children; not many books teach parents how to be parents. Most people pay attention to teachings for children. But the New Testament pays much attention to teachings for parents. It does not pay much attention to teachings about being children. Although it does teach us something about children, the emphasis is not on children. Both Ephesians 6 and Colossians 3 put more emphasis on parents than on children. We should learn to be proper parents because God pays more attention to parents than to children.</p>
<p>If we try to summarize the words in the Bible concerning parenting, the main thing parents should do is nurture their children in the teaching and admonition of the Lord and not provoke them to anger or discourage them. This means that parents must exercise self-control and must not be loose in any way. This is Paul&rsquo;s teaching concerning the subject.</p>
<p>As difficult as it is to be a husband or a wife, I hope you will realize that there is something more difficult&mdash;being a parent. Being a husband or a wife involves only two people; being a parent involves more. Being a husband or a wife is a matter of personal happiness; being a parent is something that affects the well-being of the children of the next generation. The responsibility over the future of the children of the next generation is on the shoulders of the parents.</p>
<p>We have to realize how serious this responsibility is. God has placed a person&rsquo;s body, soul, and spirit, even his whole life and future, into our hands. No individual influences another individual&rsquo;s future as much as parents. No one controls a person&rsquo;s future as much as parents. Parents almost have a say in whether their children will go to hell or to heaven. We must learn to be good husbands and good wives, but above all we must learn also to be good parents. I believe that the responsibility of being a parent is more than that of being a husband or a wife. (<em>Messages for Building Up New Believers,</em> vol. 2, pp. 519-520)</p>
<h2 class="head1">UNFEIGNED FAITH</h2>
<p>Verse 5 of 2 Timothy 1 says, &ldquo;Having been reminded of the unfeigned faith in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded dwells also in you.&rdquo; Here Paul reminds Timothy of the unfeigned faith, which is in him. This faith first indwelt Timothy&rsquo;s grandmother and then his mother. Now it dwells in him. (<em>Life-study of 2 Timothy,</em> p. 5)</p>

<p>Mary as a young woman was very familiar with the Old Testament. Mary was the right person, the proper vessel, selected by God to be the channel for the Savior&rsquo;s incarnation. In ancient times, females were not as well educated as males. However, although both Mary and Elizabeth were females, they both had gained a great deal of knowledge from the Old Testament. (<em>The Practice of Prophesying,</em> pp. 23-24)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s poetic praise is composed of many quotations from the Old Testament. This indicates that she was a godly woman, qualified to be a channel for the Savior&rsquo;s incarnation. It also indicates that the Lord Jesus would grow up in a family which would be filled with the knowledge and love of God&rsquo;s holy Word.</p>
<p>Although Mary was a young woman, she was very knowledgeable concerning the Old Testament and could quote verses from it in her praise to God. Actually, her praise was a composition of quotations from the Scriptures. Surely she was the right person for God to use in conceiving the Savior who was to be born.</p>
<p>As we consider Mary&rsquo;s praise, we can see something of the reason she was chosen by God for the conception of the Man-Savior. No doubt Mary also taught the Lord Jesus many portions from the Scriptures as He was growing up. (<em>Life-study of Luke,</em> pp. 33, 37)</p>

<p>Everything we do is some kind of sowing, either to the flesh or to the Spirit. Wherever we may be and whatever we are doing, we are sowing seeds. You sow at work and also at school. The elders sow while they are caring for the church, and those who minister the Word sow as they minister. Husbands and wives are constantly sowing in their married life, and parents are sowing in their family life. Everything parents say to their children and do with them is a seed sown into them. Day by day we all are sowing. The Christian life is a life of sowing. Furthermore, the place where we live and work is our farm. You are sowing even by the way you dress or style your hair. Virtually everything you do is an act of sowing. It is crucial for us to realize that the Christian walk must be a walk by the Spirit and a life of sowing to the Spirit.</p>
<p>In our experience, the flesh should be crucified. As Paul says in Galatians 5:24, &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.&rdquo; We should not continue to walk according to the flesh. We should not be in the flesh in expressing our attitudes. In speaking to their children, parents need to be in the Spirit and according to the Spirit. Otherwise, what they say will be a sowing unto the flesh. We should also be careful of the way we express our attitude. Even the expression of an attitude may be sowing according to the flesh. On the other hand, we may express our attitude by sowing unto the Spirit. We should also be cautious in expressing opinions. Do you have the assurance that the utterance of your opinion is according to the Spirit? If not, be careful, lest you sow unto the flesh. If we all sow unto the Spirit day by day, many problems will be eliminated. The troubles in the church life and in the family life will diminish. Most problems and troubles come from sowing unto the flesh.</p>
<p>Seeds are small. Have you ever seen a farmer sow seed which is a foot in diameter? No, the seeds a farmer sows are tiny. The same is true of our sowing. We may regard certain things as tiny&mdash;a little gossiping or a little criticizing&mdash;but they are seeds sown into others. Have you ever asked yourself how many seeds you have sown into others, seeds that are not according to the Spirit but according to the flesh? In the church life we are constantly sowing tiny seeds. Even the way one brother looks at another is a seed. We certainly sow to the flesh when we criticize, argue, or condemn. In principle, all that we say or do is a seed sown either to the flesh or to the Spirit.</p>
<p>In 5:25 Paul speaks of walking by the Spirit, and in 6:8, of sowing unto the Spirit. Actually, to walk by the Spirit is to sow unto the Spirit. Whenever we walk by the Spirit, we sow unto the Spirit. Sowing unto the Spirit, we eventually reap life eternal.</p>
<p>The fact that we may sow either to the flesh or to the Spirit and thereby reap either corruption or eternal life should encourage us to be careful in what we say and do. Let us realize that everything in our daily living is a sowing either to the flesh or to the Spirit. (<em>Life-study of Galatians,</em> pp. 258-261)</p>

<p>The word <em>sowing</em> is actually equal to living. To be careful in our sowing is to be watchful concerning our living. I repeat, sowing causes a certain result. This was the reason Paul warned us to be careful of our sowing. (<em>Life-study of Galatians,</em> p. 311)</p>

<p>The first kind of relationships in human life is family relationships. First Timothy 3:4 says, &ldquo;One who manages well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity.&rdquo; Managing one&rsquo;s house is a matter of taking the lead, but Paul&rsquo;s concept here is not mainly related to authority. As a husband and father, an overseer should take the lead in his family not merely by ruling but by establishing a good example and pattern. A family is not like a government or an organization, which are led by authority. A father&rsquo;s leadership in his family should not mainly be based on his ruling with authority but should instead be based on the pattern of his daily living. Similarly, to be an elder does not mean to rule the church with authority. This concept is absolutely wrong. A father&rsquo;s management of his family is very different from a supervisor&rsquo;s management of a business. A supervisor may hire and fire employees, but a father cannot hire or fire his children. The basic need in a family is the father&rsquo;s example. As a father, an elder must live properly before his family. This is the proper way to manage one&rsquo;s house. In our home we should not try to exercise our authority as a king, law officer, administrator, or school principal. Paul&rsquo;s concept in this section concerns the overseers&rsquo; daily living. It does not work to merely discipline our children. God&rsquo;s ordained principle is that a father must live a life that is a pattern, an example, to his children.</p>
<p>As overseers, we must take the lead in our family by presenting a pattern in our living. This is our duty. However, if our children are in subjection with all gravity, we should not think that it is because of our doing; instead, we have to worship the Lord for His mercy. Although the disposition of our children is not under our control, this does not mean we can neglect our duties to live as an example and to spend as much time and energy as we can on our children. Nevertheless, we must realize that the way our children turn out ultimately depends on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. We know that this is true, because if two children are siblings and are raised by the same parents with the same care, they may still turn out very different. One may have a good character and become a seeking believer, while the other may have a poor character and not even be saved. Therefore, we must do our duty to live a proper life as an example to our children, but we should not be discouraged or proud because of how our children turn out.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word concerning an overseer&rsquo;s children in verse 4 does not involve salvation or spirituality. We should be a good example to our children, but whether or not they will eventually be saved depends on God&rsquo;s predestination. Jacob and Esau were twins, but Romans 9:10-13 shows that their destiny depended on God&rsquo;s selection. We cannot cause our children or anyone else to be spiritual, but we can establish an example by living a sober, temperate, and orderly life and by seeking the Lord. If two flesh brothers listen to the same gospel message, one may be saved, but the other may not. We have seen cases like this. Therefore, we must be zealous in preaching the gospel and convincing people to receive the Lord, but we must also realize that a person&rsquo;s salvation ultimately depends not on our effort but on God&rsquo;s predestination. We should not think that because it depends on God&rsquo;s predestination, we do not need to preach the gospel. We must do our duty. Similarly, we should not assume that our children will behave well if we are a good example, nor should we neglect our duty. The best and most proper way to be a parent is to live as an example to our children and pray for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>If our living establishes a proper standard, we are not liable if our children behave badly. However, if we do not live as a pattern, our children&rsquo;s bad behavior is our responsibility. If they are good, the credit does not go to us, but if they are bad, we receive the &ldquo;debit.&rdquo; This is the divine accounting. We should not say that God is not fair. Romans 9:20 says, &ldquo;O man, who are you who answer back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him who molded it, Why did you make me thus?&rdquo; We cannot argue with God. If our children behave well and are eventually saved and live before the Lord, we must worship the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I am nothing. Even my best behavior is like dust; it means nothing. I can only thank You for Your mercy.&rdquo; We should not ascribe anything to our goodness. We have to acknowledge God&rsquo;s predestination, His mercy, and His grace. If our children begin to live sinfully, we must humble ourselves, praying, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I accept the blame because I may have neglected to adequately care for them in some aspect.&rdquo; This must be our attitude.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s concept in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 concerns the overseers&rsquo; living. Whether our children behave well is secondary; the primary matter is whether we have a proper living. We must take the lead and manage our family well by having a living that presents a positive pattern to them. This depends on what we are; it is a matter of life.
