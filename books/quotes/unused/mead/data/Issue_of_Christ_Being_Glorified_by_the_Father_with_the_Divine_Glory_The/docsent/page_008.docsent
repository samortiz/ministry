   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GLORIFICATION TRANSFERRING CHRIST FROM THE STAGE OF HIS INCARNATION INTO THE STAGE OF HIS INCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Such a glorification is a transfer, transferring Christ from the stage of His incarnation into the stage of His inclusion, in which He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we glorify a certain person in the sense of praising and exalting him, this kind of glorification does not transfer him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No matter how much he is glorified by being exalted and praised, he remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, God's glorification of Christ transferred Christ from one stage to another stage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was in the first stage, the stage of incarnation, but He was transferred out of that stage into the second stage, the stage of inclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the stage of inclusion He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ's being glorified was a drastic change not only in His condition and situation but also in His nature, element, and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we glorify someone by exalting him, we may change him in his condition and situation, but we do not change him in his nature, element, and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because he is now praised instead of despised, his condition and situation are changed, but his nature, element, and essence remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The glorification of Christ was very different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to see that Christ's being glorified by the Father was a drastic change not merely in condition and situation but also in His nature, in His element, and in His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was the release of the glory of Christ's divinity through the baptism of His death on the cross.</S>
