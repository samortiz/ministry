   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ's Coming and Going to Produce the Mutual Dwelling of God and Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospel of John reveals that the Father is in the Son, coming to be among humanity, and the Son became the Spirit to enter into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His entering into man was accomplished by means of His going in death and His coming in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ's going was not to leave the disciples but a further step to come into them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By the first step of incarnation He came to be among them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After that, He needed to take another step to enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Incarnation was the first step of His coming, and death and resurrection was the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Apparently Christ's death was His going, but actually it was His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His going to die did not mean that He left the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It only means that He took another step to get into them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, the Lord could say, "If I go I am coming" 14:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He seemed to be saying, "Do not be sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not think that I am going to leave you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have come to you, but at this time I am only among you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is only the first step; I cannot yet enter into you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I must do something further so that I can be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I must take a further step to die and resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After death and resurrection, I will then be able to enter into you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, My going is My coming."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, the Gospel of John does not say that after Christ died and resurrected, He left the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, it tells us that after He died and resurrected, He came to them and entered into them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 20 the Lord said, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you," and in verse 3 He said, "Where I am you also may be."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On "that day" the disciples would be where the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Where is the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, in that day they would be in the Father also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While the Lord was speaking this, they were not yet in the Father because Christ had not yet died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord was still in the form of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He needed to die and resurrect, and after His death and resurrection, He was transfigured into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then, at that time He was able to enter into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since the Lord was in the Father and they were in Him, spontaneously they were also in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is in this way that the Lord brought them into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now where the Lord is, we are there also.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way God becomes our abode, and we become God's abode, so in the following chapter there is the mutual abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 15:4 says, "Abide in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By His coming in incarnation, Christ brought God into man, and by His going through death and resurrection He brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now God and man, man and God, become a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We abide in God, and God abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The way has been paved, and the fact has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we simply enjoy this mutual abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now, in the Father's house, that is, in the temple of God, the church, each one of us not only has a place, but each one of us is a "place."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We not only have an abode; each one is an abode.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Revelation 21 and 22 it is difficult to see who the dwellers are in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The twelve apostles are not, strictly speaking, the dwellers there; they are the foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may compare them to bricks in a building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not say that bricks dwell in the building; they are only part of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in another sense, the building becomes the dwelling place of the bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Similarly, when we are built into the church, the building of God becomes our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All of the saved and redeemed ones are parts of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who then is the dweller?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is the Triune God.</S>
