<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(57)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 10, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER L. Y.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. Because of my active personality, I did not want to be bound by the job of a shopkeeper. I had revolutionary thoughts, and I joined the Revolutionary Army at one time. In the army I saw an opium addict who experienced a great change when he believed in the Lord. He took me to a gospel meeting. I became acquainted with Christ through his influence and picked up an interest for the Bible, prayer, and spiritual books. Once I knelt down to pray and confessed my sins, and joy filled my heart. Later I attended the church and was baptized into the Lord's name. At my baptism, tears rolled down my cheeks. I was a very tough person, and it was hard for me to cry. Later I read Rethinking the Work and learned the truth concerning the church. Through reading The Orthodoxy of the Church, I also came to know the history of the church. Later I found out that there was a training on this mountain, and with Brother Nee's approval, I was able to come. It is the Lord's mercy that I am able to be here.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Our brother has been running a very straight pathway, and his spirit is fairly strong. I hope that our brother will understand that there are two aspects to our service to the Lord: First, there is obedience to the truth, and second, there is obedience to the discipline of the Spirit. Our brother should learn more lessons in obedience to the discipline of the Spirit. He should learn to yield to the environment and allow God's breaking hand to operate on him. Some people have strong experiences of obedience to the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Others do not experience the same thing. A person with a meek disposition does not need strong discipline from the Spirit, but a person with a stubborn disposition needs strong discipline from the Spirit. With some it is not a matter of difficulty in the work of discipline but a matter of their unwillingness to accept the discipline. If a man refuses to learn the inward lessons, he will never be clear about the way of life.</p><p>On the one hand, God grants us the knowledge of Himself through His truth. On the other hand, He arranges the environment around us in such a way that we can become clear of His ways. When these two things combine together, we have a balanced experience. Some submit to the environment, but their obedience to God's commandment in His Word is not that clear. This is not enough. Some have learned some lessons concerning God's commandments in the Bible, but they lack the discipline in the environment. As a result, they also become a problem. Actually, we learn to submit to the outward environment for the sake of taking care of our inward needs. If a man only pays attention to his inward feelings, it is easy for him to become self-confident. When he makes a mistake and others exhort him, he may say, "Let me pray and see how I feel about it." Such a person will have a problem obeying the commandments. If an officer issues an order to his subordinate or if a master tells his servant to do something, it is totally wrong to respond, "Let me consider it a little." He should obey immediately. If I tell my cook to prepare some porridge, and he says he will consider it, his consideration will cost his job.</p><p>The same can be said of spiritual things. If you tell a person who has believed in his heart to be baptized, he should not say that he will consider it. The Bible clearly says, "Believe and be baptized." It does not give anyone the ground for consideration. Many people, however, have their own thoughts. Some are quick to obey the truth but short in obeying the inner lessons. Some have their own plans, preferences, and opinions, but when God deals with them, they drop these things. Others cannot drop them and cannot submit. In any case, God will lead you into His will. The truth will make your outward pathway straight, and the discipline of the Spirit will deepen and purify you, encouraging you to go on. The more we are on the way of the truth, the more we will experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Naturally, both aspects of God's work are for our edification. These two ways are one, and they work together to produce one kind of riches. In fact, the two ways eventually become one way. In other words, there will be no difference between the inward and the outward. When both lines have done their work, God will have a useful vessel in His hand.</p><p>Many have received supply from the truth and the discipline of the Spirit, enabling them to serve others. The discipline of the Holy Spirit begins the day you place yourself unreservedly in God's hand. Once you genuinely consecrate yourself to the Lord, He will begin arranging everything. He will not spare anything. Once you place yourself in the Lord's hand in a definite way, the discipline of the Spirit will come. He will not let you go. He will surround you, smite you, wall you in, and force you to take His way. It is a pity that many Christians have neglected the discipline of the Spirit. It is possible for a man to say that he has not received any supply from the church because he cannot find fellowship, or that he does not have the supply of the ministry because something is wrong with the ministry. But no one can say that he does not have or is short of the discipline of the Holy Spirit. It is possible for a brother or sister to be without the supply of the church or the ministry for five or ten years. However, it is impossible for him to be without the discipline of the Holy Spirit. This discipline is always present. God will never give up those who have committed themselves to Him; He will always discipline them.</p><p>We have to learn to take care of two principles with regards to the way of life. The first relates to one's ministry, and the second relates to the way one deals with others. Both aspects involve great principles. Some Christians have both, while others have none. Some have only one aspect, while others are strong in one and weak in the other. I hope that the church will have a straight pathway in the future. But this pathway greatly depends on us. People may be different, but that will not make much of a difference. The few dozen people here on the mountain can serve as a fairly representative group of all men. We can all learn to serve in the ministry, in the way of life, and in our dealing with other people.</p>
