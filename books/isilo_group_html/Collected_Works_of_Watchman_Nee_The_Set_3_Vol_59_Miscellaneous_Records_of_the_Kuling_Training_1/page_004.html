First Corinthians 2 speaks of a kind of people whose spirit discerns all things. As God's children, we know things by our spirit. We all have a spirit. However, it is strange that many people cannot use their spirit; their spirit does not function. It would be terrible if all the lights in the city of Foochow refused to work when we needed them and worked when we did not need them. Perhaps three or five brothers among us can use their spirit. The rest only touch their spirit occasionally and accidentally. If we cannot use our spirit, we can only depend on our eloquence, our mental ability, and our cleverness. May the Lord have mercy on us and judge us when we work by our eloquence, mental ability, and cleverness.</p><p>The most fundamental thing for a worker to have is his spirit. If I work as a telegraph operator, I need one basic faculty&mdash;my ears. An operator cannot have a problem with his ears. In serving the Lord, we can have a problem with our ears, eyes, hands, feet, or mouth, but we can never have a problem with our spirit. Once we realize that we serve and worship God with our spirit, we should learn not to trust in our emotion or our strength. We should pray instead that the Lord would empower us to exercise our spirit. If you do this, we can send you away in peace, and the church can send you away in peace as well. We should not think that this is a simple matter. This demands our very life. Our entire being has to change. We have to tear down our theology and learn instead to exercise our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BENEFITS OF EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Those who are able to exercise their spirit reap four benefits from their exercise. First, they are able to live before God. While they contact others with their spirit, they are able to keep themselves in God's presence at the same time. They do not have to turn back to God after they have contacted men. Second, those who exercise their spirit know men. Third, they can release the power that is within them. Ephesians 6:10 says, "Be empowered." This has nothing to do with praying for power to come upon us from on high. We have to be the ones who will to be empowered. When we want to be empowered, the power within us will be released. When we do not consciously will to be empowered, the power within us will not be released. When a man exercises his spirit, it is easy for his very being to flow out. His spirit is not gagged but instead flows out easily. This means that his entire being opens up to others easily. It is hard for some people to release their spirit because they have too many shells; their outer man is not broken. Fourth, it is easy for those who exercise their spirit to receive others' spirit. It is also easy for them to receive the Holy Spirit. It is easy for such ones to receive help from others because their spirit is open.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
