   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE THE SERVICE IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>LISTENING TO OTHERS TALKS 8</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Date:Morning, January 19, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Place:Brother Cheng's home, Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF SPIRITUAL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man always pays attention to methods and ways.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, a way is just a law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has no intention for us to know the methods, but He intends for us to have the knowledge of the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At present, our knowledge concerning spiritual matters, such as loving the Lord or consecration of material things, is not genuine enough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not sufficient for a person merely to know that there is air and light; he has to have a genuine realization of what air and light are.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past seven or eight years, many times we have probed for ways; we hoped to find out the proper way to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But what God is after is our genuine knowledge concerning Him and concerning spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE BODY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Service is not an individual matter; it is a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible uses the body as an illustration of this matter 1 Cor 12:12-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Any time a member is isolated, it becomes useless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The minute we mention the members, we think of their functions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As far as our function is concerned, we are the members, not the sons, the workers, or the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can be God's workers individually, and we can be brothers and sisters or children of God individually.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we cannot be members individually.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible mentions the Body in at least three places.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are 1 Corinthians 12, Romans 12, and Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's Will Being the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 12 first mentions consecration v. 1 . Next, it speaks of knowing the will of God v. 2 . After this, it speaks of the Body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today, many people talk about Romans 12, verses 1 and 2, but they separate these verses from the Body mentioned in the following verses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The period after verse 2 should be removed, because verse 3 is connected to verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 2 mentions the will of God, and in verse 4 we see that God's will is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Chapters one through eight of Romans speak of God's work, and chapters nine through eleven speak of God's mercy and selection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Based on His work and selection, we should consecrate ourselves to Him, and the goal is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Coordination in the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Corinthians 12 speaks of the coordination in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we do not see individual members; we see only the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul used many words to explain this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every Member Coordinated in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ephesians 4 also speaks of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There we see that all the brothers and sisters need to coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, the mouth may be very useful, but it can only fulfill its function when it is coordinated in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A member is not the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some people may be "first-class" members, great members, but they are nevertheless members only.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the other hand, other people may be small members, but they can never be so small that they cease to be members.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is much that we can say about this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You can ask a medical doctor, and he will tell you that if the coordination in the body is out of order by a little, the body will be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Someone has once said that sickness is caused by the malfunction of the coordination in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every member has to learn to coordinate with other members.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This may cause one member to feel uncomfortable, or it may cause another member to feel uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, even if it involves bringing discomfort to ourselves, we must nevertheless not care only for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Almost all the mistakes committed by Christians are on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once the Body is not comfortable, the supply will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we want to be coordinated together, we must ensure that the Body feels comfortable.</S>
