   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GATE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Praise the Lord that He is not only the wall but also the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the wall He excludes us and condemns us, but as the gate He brings us into God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are in the sphere of God s building today, it is because Christ as the gate has brought us in.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is our gate, our door.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus tells us that He is the way to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Apart from Him, no one can come to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is the gateway for us to enter into God and into God s interests, God s building, and God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may realize that Christ is the door, the gate, but we may not know Christ as the gate in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ezekiel, however, saw the details concerning Christ as the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Measurements</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The depth of the gate, from the front to the rear, is fifty cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The breadth of the gate, from side to side, is twenty-five cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These numbers are both multiples of five, the number of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Stair of Seven Steps</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In front of the gate is a stair of seven steps.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The steps of ascent are quite high, indicating that in order to get into the building, we need to go up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he has the sense that he is going up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when we participate in certain worldly amusements, we have the sense that we are going down.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever we come to the Lord Jesus, we sense that we are on a staircase going up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Composed of Four Sections</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The gate is composed of four sections: the outer threshold, the passage, the inner threshold, and the porch.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are three thresholds, which are the outer threshold, the inner threshold, and a passage between these two which may be considered a hallway.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The middle part, the passage, is also called a threshold, but as a help to our understanding we may use the word passage.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, here we have the outer threshold, the passage, the inner threshold, and the porch.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The porch is somewhat like a lobby to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By passing through the outer threshold, the passage, the inner threshold, and the lobby, one can enter into the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then one must take another flight of stairs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This time the ascent is even higher, being eight steps rather than seven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Entry of the Gate</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By referring to figure 2 , which is a drawing of the gate detail, we can see that within the gate is the entry of the gate, which is exactly ten cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is significant that the opening of the entrance is ten cubits in width.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Bible the number ten first refers to the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever the Ten Commandments require, the entry of the gate fulfills.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The width of the entry is exactly the span of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that the Lord Jesus fulfilled all the requirements of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are faced with the Ten Commandments, we are excluded by them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the Lord Jesus was able to fulfill every commandment, and He has become the gate for us to enter into God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whereas the entry, or opening, of the gate is ten cubits wide, the gate itself is thirteen cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On both sides of the gate, the wall measures one and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By adding the two together, we have three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Three is the number of the Triune God and also the number of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here the three is divided, with one and a half on each side.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I would ask you to remember that in the tabernacle the standing boards were each one and a half cubits wide and that two boards formed one unit of three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All these numbers are significant.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They indicate that the Lord Jesus, who fulfills all the requirements of the Ten Commandments, is the Triune God who became a man, was put to death, and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In His death Christ was split, cut into halves, and then He was resurrected.</S>
