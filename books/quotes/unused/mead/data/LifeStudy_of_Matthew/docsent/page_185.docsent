   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST TRANSFIGURED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ON A HIGH MOUNTAIN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew 17:1 says, And after six days Jesus takes with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since the Lord s transfiguration transpired six days after the revelations concerning Christ and the church in chapter sixteen given at the very foot of Mount Hermon , the high mountain here must be Mount Hermon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To receive the revelation concerning Christ and the church we must be far away from the religious environment; but to see the vision of the transfigured Christ we need to be on a high mountain, far above the earthly level.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 2 says, And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not many Christians realize that Christ s transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the past we pointed out that the Lord s coming will not take place suddenly; rather, it will come gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In a sense, the Lord will come back from heaven; but in another sense, He will come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He fully lives Himself out of us, that will be the time of His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Matthew 17:1 with 16:28, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He was transfigured, He was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we must see what it means to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Christ, who is God, became a man, His divinity was incarnated in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was a unique person, one possessing both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His divinity was concealed within His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Outwardly, He was a man, but inwardly He was the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God was hidden, contained, concealed, within this man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Glory is God manifested, God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is nothing other than God Himself manifested and seen by man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The God hidden within the humanity of Jesus was the very glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, the glorious divine element was concealed within the human element of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As He walked on earth, no one could see His glorious divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many saw the miracles and realized that He was someone extraordinary, but prior to His transfiguration no one had ever seen the glory concealed within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then one day He brought three of His most intimate disciples to a high mountain, and was there transfigured before them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the Lord Jesus to be transfigured meant that His humanity was saturated and permeated with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may say that His humanity was soaked with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This transfiguration, which was His glorification, was equal to His coming in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that Christ s coming in His kingdom is linked with His transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Where His transfiguration is, there the coming of the kingdom is also.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The coming of the kingdom is the Lord s glorification, His transfiguration; and His glorification is the saturation of His humanity by His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the meaning of transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because the Lord has been transfigured, He is now in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Christ s transfiguration, His humanity was glorified; it was brought into God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before that time, God was in Him, but His humanity was not in God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In His transfiguration His humanity was thoroughly saturated with His glorious divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the coming manifestation of the kingdom, Christ will be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He will be the very Christ with both divinity and humanity, but His humanity will be soaked with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The day is coming when we shall not only see this, but also experience it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We now have the divine life with the divine nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, we still have our natural humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No matter how spiritual and holy we may be, our humanity is still natural.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It has not yet been saturated with the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But at the time of the manifestation of the kingdom, our humanity will be glorified by the glorious divinity within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps the opposers will label this evolution into God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But this is not evolution into God it is glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The opposers need to read Romans 8:30: And whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would like to ask the opposers what they think it means to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do they think that to be glorified is merely to enter the realm of glory?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a very superficial understanding of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be glorified is to be saturated with God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is to be transfigured, not from without, but from within.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One day we shall be a great surprise to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Second Thessalonians 1:10 says, When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The unbelievers will be shocked by our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because in our humanity we are the same as the unbelievers, they can see no difference between us and them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the day is coming when they will see a glorious difference, for our humanity will be saturated with divinity, and we shall become a glorious people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We shall not just be spiritual, holy, pure, and clean.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We shall be glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the coming of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are waiting for this to take place.</S>
