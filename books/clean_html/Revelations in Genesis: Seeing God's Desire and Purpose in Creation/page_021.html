<h2 class="head3">Everything outside of God Being Death</h2>
<p>May we be enlightened to see that as long as something is outside of God, whether it is knowledge, good, or evil, it is not God; rather, it is death. Some people may think that only evil is death and that only evildoers belong to death. They do not consider doing good to be death, nor do they consider studying knowledge or developing the mind to also be death. The Bible reveals that only God is life; everything outside of God, whether it is knowledge, good, or evil, is death. Knowledge, good, and evil do not represent Satan directly; they represent everything outside of God, the ultimate destination of which is Satan.</p>
<p>Everything outside of God is related to Satan. One day the Lord said that He must go to Jerusalem and be killed. Peter, who loved the Lord, took the Lord aside and rebuked Him, saying, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; But the Lord immediately rebuked Peter, saying, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan!&rdquo; (Matt. 16:21-23). Even Peter, who loved the Lord, was called Satan. I hope that we would see the light revealed here. The tree of life is God, because only God is life. Everything outside of God is death, Satan. Our hatred is Satan, and our love may also be Satan. Whether our love is Satan depends on whether our love comes from God, because only God is not Satan. People think that to do evil is satanic, but to do good is angelic. This, however, is not the case. A good deed that is not in God is of Satan.</p>
<p>God has enlightened us to see these two trees. Moreover, these two trees represent everything in the universe. One tree represents God, and the other tree represents everything outside of God. Only God is life. Anything outside of God, whatever it may be, is death; it is Satan. Even the words of the Bible can bring man into death if the Spirit is not in them. Only God is life, because only God is Spirit (John 4:24). Only the Spirit can cause man to gain God in order to enliven man (2 Cor. 3:6). Everything outside of God is related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the totality of which is Satan and the ultimate end of which is death.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Embodiment of Satan</h2>
<p>From Genesis 3 to the end of Revelation, the Bible mainly speaks of Satan indirectly through his deeds and hidden activities in persons, matters, and things. Even in Genesis 3 the name Satan is not mentioned; rather, there is mention of a serpent, which is Satan. If someone says that Satan is in Genesis 3, he is being too rigid. We must take a more indirect way and say that there is a serpent in Genesis 3, that Satan was hidden in this serpent, and that the serpent was the embodiment of Satan. Satan was in the serpent; therefore, the serpent was Satan.</p>
<p>Isaiah 14:12-15 says, &ldquo;How you have fallen from heaven, / O Daystar, son of the dawn! / How you have been hewn down to earth, / You who made nations fall prostrate! / But you, you said in your heart: / I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne. / And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / In the uttermost parts of the north. / I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will make myself like the Most High. / But you will be brought down to Sheol, / To the uttermost parts of the pit.&rdquo; Bible scholars acknowledge that these verses refer to Satan. On the surface these verses are about the king of Babylon, but Satan was hidden in the king of Babylon.</p>
<p>In the same principle, Ezekiel 28:12-17 says, &ldquo;Take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, O you who sealed up perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, you were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering...The workmanship of your tambourines and your pipes was prepared with you on the day that you were created. You were the anointed cherub who covered the Ark; indeed I set you, so that you were upon the holy mountain of God; you walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you. By the abundance of your trading they filled your midst with violence, and you sinned. So I cast you out as profane from the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness. I cast you to the ground; I presented you before kings that they may look at you.&rdquo; This portion does not speak explicitly of Satan but of the king of Tyre. However, Satan was hidden in the king of Tyre.</p>
<p>When Peter rebuked the Lord in Matthew 16, he was not being evil but good; however, Satan was hidden even in Peter&rsquo;s good. In John 13 Judas was also Satan (vv. 21-27). In Revelation Antichrist is Satan (13:1-8). This is a principle: Satan is hidden in persons, matters, and things.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the brothers and sisters are speaking, I am clear that they are brothers and sisters on the outside but Satan on the inside. They are children of God, but they are Satan on the inside; their words make them oracles of Satan. Satan often speaks from within our friends, relatives, spouses, parents, and children. He is not only in persons but also in things. Some things may be an embodiment of Satan, because he hides in and behind them. He has a cunning plan to disguise and embody himself in many things. This is another principle of Satan.</p>
<p>In Genesis 3 Satan was embodied in a serpent. The serpent was originally pleasant to the eye, being delicate in shape and having a beautiful pattern. It became hideous later because of the curse. The serpent may have climbed up the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and coiled itself around it in order to get Eve&rsquo;s attention. When he caught her attention, he spoke, and Eve was tempted. Eve did not know that Satan was in the serpent. Many people seem to be worshipping idols, but they are actually worshipping Satan, because Satan is behind every idol.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we can see Satan&rsquo;s subtle tactics. The principle of his activities is usually not to do things himself. He wanted to frustrate the Lord Jesus from going to the cross, but he did not do this personally; instead, he used a disciple who loved the Lord. Peter thought that he loved the Lord, but he had no realization that Satan was using him (Matt. 16:21-23). Therefore, we must be watchful. If our loving intentions and loving heart for the Lord can be used by Satan, how much more can he use our love for the world and the things of the flesh? If our considerations for the Lord and our love for the Lord can be used by Satan, we should not think that Satan cannot use other things. In fact, outside of God every thing, matter, and person is Satan.</p>
<p>Some saints may ask, &ldquo;How can someone such as me be Satan?&rdquo; But even their asking this question is Satan. If we understand Satan&rsquo;s tactics, we will realize that he is everywhere; he is in every matter, in everything, and in everyone. Everything outside of God is Satan. Satan is often behind someone&rsquo;s attitude and words; he is behind someone&rsquo;s glare and behind the things that gleam in our eyes. Many persons, matters, and things are Satan. If we understand this, we are blessed.</p>
