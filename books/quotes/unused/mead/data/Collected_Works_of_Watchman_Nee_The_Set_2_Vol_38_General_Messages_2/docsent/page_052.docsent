   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SUPPLY IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One principle of the Body is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fellowship of the Body is not just a matter of receiving but also a matter of supplying.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you think that all you have to do is receive and behave in an orderly and quiet way without causing any trouble, you do not know what is meant by the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have become a hindering stone, a sickness, and a burden to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brothers and sisters, you have to remember that fellowship has to do with the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fellowship is the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every part of the Body is open to continuous circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever any part of the Body is cut off from fellowship, it becomes dead.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever a part is sick, the other parts will come to its rescue.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the law of our physical body; it is the same with the spiritual Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The principle of the Body life is mutual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever a member acts against this law, he brings death into the Body and becomes a burden to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul told the Corinthians, "Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let all things be done for building up" 1 Cor 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many come to meetings as spectators; they are bystanders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To come to the meeting in this way is to bring death to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A meeting often dies at the hand of the bystanders.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brothers and sisters, we must supply each other not only at the bread-breaking meeting but also at the message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every part of the Body is in circulation, and no one can be stagnant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Anyone who becomes stagnant is halting the life of God and bringing death into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is impossible to have one member stagnant without causing damage to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No member can be useful without the supply of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some become hurt and decide to hide themselves and to be alone, pursuing spirituality individually.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But let them try and see whether they can truly be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Life cannot become stagnant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Never think that a person can be spiritual by hiding in a place alone to have a spiritual retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The vessel God is after is a Body, not individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who are independent and detached from the Body will not last for long.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus was thirsty one day as He sat by the well of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Samaritan woman was thirstier than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord gave her the living water, she was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the disciples came back with food, the Lord was no longer hungry John 4:5-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we serve others and quench their thirst, we become satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we learn to bear others' burdens, our own burden becomes light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no retirement in spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working" John 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever we stop functioning, we stop living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A Christian must supply others not only in meetings but also in his daily life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May the Lord open our eyes to see the Body, to have the protection of the Body, to be restricted by the Body, and to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the Lord show each one of us that we all have a part in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not enough for us to speak about the Body; we have to practice the Body in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Body of Christ is not a doctrine but a real life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, if we find that we can live and walk without the protection, restriction, and supply of the Body, we have not seen the revelation of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After a person has received God's life, he will feel dry if he walks according to his natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same way, after one has received the revelation of the Body of Christ, he will feel wrong as soon as he walks in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not have the revelation, it is easy for us to forget this, and we will remember it only as long as we remember the doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if we have this revelation, the revelation itself will become a law of life in us, and there will be no need to remember anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, we do not have to remember to blink our eyes; spontaneously our eyes blink.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we have received the revelation of the Body of Christ, spontaneously we will feel the need for the Body; there will be no need for us to remember anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who walk according to outward laws are the Jews, and those who live according to their memory are living according to the law and not according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are touched by the Lord within, and if our eyes are opened to see the Body of Christ, we will spontaneously live in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, the most important thing is to have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God is recovering the life of the Body rather than the doctrine of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Body of Christ is a life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Body of Christ is a matter of experience, and we have to enter into the reality of this Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers and sisters, if we are in the Body of Christ, we will know that it is something real and concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must not only understand the principle of the Body of Christ, we must also see the principle of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we see the Body, we will have the Body life spontaneously.</S>
