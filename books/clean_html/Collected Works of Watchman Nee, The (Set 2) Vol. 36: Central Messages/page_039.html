<h2 class="head2">The Rock Being Peter's Confession</h2><p>The church is built upon this rock, and this rock is Christ, the Son of God. The rock is also the revelation which God has given to man. Furthermore, the rock is the confession which issues from those who have received the revelation. We need to see. But confession is also very important. When our Lord was on earth, He said, "I am" (John 8:24). He is pleased to hear us confess, "You are." God is always pleased to hear and accept our salutation when we say, "You are." We say to the Lord, "You are Lord!" This is a very important word. We declare, "Jesus is Lord!" This is a very powerful declaration. Sometimes everything around us seems to be in confusion; Satan mocks us and tells us that we are through. At such times, prayer may not work, and the best thing to do is to declare loudly, "Jesus is Lord!" You will find that the difficulties are nothing and Satan's mockery is nothing. When you are put into any trial, you should rise up to speak. You may speak in your own room or in the prayer meeting. But wherever you are, you should say, "Jesus is Lord!" and tell Him, "You are!" The Lord likes to hear such a declaration. This will give us strength from within.</p><p>The Lord Jesus likes to hear the words "You are!" Otherwise, why would He have asked His disciples? If the disciples did not know the answer, what was the use of asking them? If they knew the answer, what need was there for the Lord to ask them such a question? The Lord Jesus asked this question because He wanted Peter to speak out. We have to remember that the foundation of the church is not only built upon the revelation from God, but upon Peter's declaration of the revelation he received. God has revealed His Son to us and unveiled His masterpiece to us. When we speak out and confess this revelation from God, and when we confess that Jesus is the Son of God and the Christ, we have the church. The church is Christ's voice on earth. God allows the church to remain on earth as a declarer and a confessor of Christ. It was not enough for Peter to say in his heart, "I believe that the Lord is powerful, that He reigns, and that He is glorious." It was not enough for Peter to say to the Lord, "Lord, I believe You in my heart." The Lord asked, "Who do you say that I am?" "You" refers to the Lord's disciples. "Who do you say...?" The disciples had to do one thing, which was to say, to speak with their mouth. What should they say? They should say who the Lord is. They should speak out the Lord Himself; they should say who He is. We have to pay attention to the phrase, "Who do you say that I am?" We have to remember that the church is built upon our confession of the Lord. The Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it." If we have not seen the relationship between the church and the gates of Hades, we will not realize the importance of speaking; we will think that believing in the heart or praying is all that is needed. But if we see that the church is here to close the gates of Hades, we will realize that a declaration of who Jesus of Nazareth is is a declaration with life, with power, and with authority. Some can testify that they have often encountered difficulties before the Lord, and they could not get through no matter how hard they tried to believe. It seemed as if neither faith, prayer, nor supplications would work. But one day they stood up and said, "Lord, You are the Lord. You are the King! You have trodden the devil under. You are the One who has destroyed the work of the devil!" When they declared this, the power came. Therefore, the best prayer is not a supplication. The best prayer is to say, "You are! You are!" This should be the church's declaration of faith. Let me repeat this again: the church is not only built upon God's revelation, but also upon man's declaration of this revelation. A declaration that comes as a result of a revelation has spiritual value to it; there is power to it, and it shakes Hades.</p><p>We know that Peter was a talkative person. The Lord interrupted his speaking more than once. But this time, He allowed Peter to go on and even called him blessed after he finished. Peter's word represented the voice of the church. It is a voice that heaven loves to hear and a voice that is hard to find on earth. It is also a voice that Hades dreads to hear and a voice that God desires to find! In our prayer meetings, in the bread-breaking meetings, and in our personal prayers, we should learn to say more and more, "You are!" The Lord Himself declared on earth, "I am!" We should gladly respond, "You are! You are!" There are no better words than these. "You are" is the foundation of the church. The foundation of the church is built upon the Lord Himself; it is built upon God's revelation of the Lord. The foundation of the church is also built upon our declaration before men and the devil, a declaration of the Lord which comes as a result of our knowledge through revelation.</p><p>After Peter declared, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Lord Jesus said, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona." Simon is Peter. The prefix Bar means a son. Barjona means the son of Jona. The Lord pointed out Peter's name and said, "Blessed are you," and He even mentioned Peter's father's name. The Simon who was so blessed was not any Simon, but Simon the son of Jona. Following this, the Lord said, "You are Peter." This shows us that this revelation is a personal one; it is absolutely personal. This declaration and confession are also personal, absolutely personal. Those who do not have such a revelation before the Lord and who do not have such a confession have no part in this blessing.</p><p>In short, this rock signifies three things: (1) This rock is Christ, the Son of the living God. (2) This rock is the revelation of Christ, the Son of the living God. (3) This rock is also Peter's confession of Christ, the Son of the living God. When we combine these three aspects together, we have "this rock" that the Lord spoke of.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IS BUILT UPON THIS ROCK</h2><p>The Lord Jesus said, "You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church." The name "Peter" means a little rock in the original language (John 1:42), while the word "rock" means a big rock. The Lord's choice of words here is very meaningful. He was saying, "You are a little rock, and I will build My church upon this big rock." The foundation of the church is Christ Himself. Christ is like a big rock. The church is built upon Christ. "You are Peter." This means that "you are a little rock. You Peter are a part of Christ." The Lord showed us that He needs many little rocks. He will build His church with these many little rocks. "This rock" is the big rock, which is the foundation. There is only one foundation, but there are many small rocks. We need to join with Peter to know who this Jesus of Nazareth is, and we need to join with Peter to confess who He is.</p><p>The foundation of the church is Christ Himself. The church is built upon Christ. This building is still going on, even today. He is building the little rocks upon this foundation. If a man wants to be a useful vessel to the Lord, he must know the Lord Jesus as the Son of God and as the Christ of God. We must not only see Him as the Savior, but as Christ and as the One appointed by God to accomplish His goal. The church must have this revelation, this testimony, and this declaration before the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. All the temptations of the devil and everything that death can do will fall before such a church. The church overcomes all the power of Satan through its inward revelation and through the testimony of its mouth. Hallelujah, the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church. Death is swallowed up by life because the Lord has built His church upon "this rock"!</p>
