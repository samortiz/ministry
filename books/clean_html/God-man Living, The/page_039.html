<h2 class="head5">7) Recognizing and Praising Reverently That the Kingdom,<br />
the Power, and the Glory Belong to the Father Forever</h2>
<p>The prayer to the Father concludes in this way: &ldquo;For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen&rdquo; (Matt. 6:13). Here is the realization and praise of God&rsquo;s kingdom, power, and glory. This also refers to the Triune God. The kingdom is of the Son, which is the realm in which God exercises His power. The power is of the Spirit, which carries out God&rsquo;s intention so that the Father can express His glory. This indicates that the prayer which the Lord teaches us to pray begins with the Triune God, in the sequence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and ends also with the Triune God, but in the sequence of the Son, the Spirit, and the Father. Thus, the prayer taught by the Lord in His supreme teaching begins with God the Father and ends also with God the Father. God the Father is both the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega.</p>
<p>Such a critical prayer surely increases our seeking of the kingdom of the heavens as the Father&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and affords us our need of the divine supply of grace to fulfill all the supreme and strict requirements of the kingdom of the heavens for the Father&rsquo;s good pleasure. On the one hand, we are seeking for something according to the Father&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. On the other hand, we have the supply to fulfill something for the Father&rsquo;s good pleasure.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Four Negative Charges as Warnings</h2>
<h2 class="head5">1) Not Praying As the Hypocrites Do</h2>
<p>The Lord warned His disciples not to pray as the hypocrites do with a mask. They love to make a show publicly that they may be seen by men and receive glory from them according to the lust of their fleshly desire. Instead, the disciples should enter into their private room, shutting their door and praying to the Father in the heavens to be seen by Him in secret and repaid by Him (vv. 5-6). We have to learn to be secret persons. We should pray in our private place to be seen by the Father in secret, not by others for an outward public display. If we pray properly, God will repay us as a reward. The hypocrites have received their reward already, but we want to receive our God&rsquo;s repayment.</p>
<h2 class="head5">2) Not Praying As the Gentiles Do</h2>
<p>The disciples should not pray as the Gentiles do, babbling empty words, supposing that in their multiplicity of words they will be heard. This is because the Father of the disciples knows the things that they need before they ask Him (vv. 7-8). Some have accused us by saying that our pray-reading of the Word is repetitious, but pray-reading is spiritual breathing. Breathing is always repetitious. If we do not repeat our breathing, we will die.</p>
<h2 class="head5">3) Forgiving Men&rsquo;s Offenses</h2>
<p>If His disciples forgive men&rsquo;s offenses, their heavenly Father will forgive the disciples also; otherwise, their Father will not forgive their offenses. This annuls their prayer to their heavenly Father (vv. 14-15).</p>
<h2 class="head5">4) Not Fasting like the Sullen-faced Hypocrites</h2>
<p>His disciples should not fast like the sullen-faced hypocrites, disfiguring their faces that their fast may appear to men. The disciples should fast by anointing their head and washing their face that their fast may not appear to men but to their Father who is in secret and who sees it and will repay them (vv. 16-18).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Second Time Being<br />
in the Conclusion of His Supreme Teaching<br />
concerning the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>Now we want to consider the second time the Lord taught the disciples concerning prayer in His supreme teaching on the mount. The second time is in the conclusion of His supreme teaching concerning the kingdom of the heavens, when He made a promise to the seekers of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 7:7-8. The Lord said, &ldquo;Ask [indicating the prayer at a distance] and it shall be given to you; seek [indicating the pursuit of what is prayed for] and you shall find; knock [indicating the reaching of the goal of what is sought] and it shall be opened to you.&rdquo; Such a promise assures the seekers of the kingdom of the heavens that they will be given an open door to enter into all the blessings in the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>When we read the supreme teaching of the Lord on the mount recorded in Matthew 5&mdash;7, we may be disappointed and think that we cannot make it because of the supreme, strict requirements. So at the conclusion, there is a prayer which is actually a promise. The Lord promised us that if we ask, we will receive; if we seek, we will find; and if we knock, it will be opened to us. If we ask, seek, and knock, we will enter into all the blessings in the kingdom of the heavens for our supreme and strict kingdom life. This promise affords us the grace that we need to fulfill the supreme and strict requirements. The door will be opened wide for us to enter into all the blessings of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
