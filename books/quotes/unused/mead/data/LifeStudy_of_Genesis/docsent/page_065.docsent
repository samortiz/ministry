   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 There Was No Man to Till the Ground</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And there was not a man to till the ground."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This signifies that there was no man to work with God in coordination by human labor with the divine cf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 Cor 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians are too super-spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When they are too "super," they become superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are superficially spiritual, saying, "We should not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit does everything."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do nothing, God cannot do anything, for He needs human labor to cooperate with His divine labor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is the use of the rain coming down if there is no man to till the ground?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If, as a man, you have tilled the ground, you have the right to pray, "Lord, I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Send the rain."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then God will send rain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, suppose there is no man upon the earth claiming the rain and some angel says, "O God Jehovah, why don't You send the rain?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God will reply, "If I send My rain, it will be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am waiting for a man to till the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once the man on the earth has tilled the ground, I will send rain."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In these days the church is concerned about gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose, however, there is not one Christian in Anaheim working with God and some angels in the air pray, "O God Almighty, save the people in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Send out Your voice and everyone will repent."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God would reply, "This is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When there is no one in Anaheim working with Me, how can I save people?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you remember the story of Cornelius?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although an angel came to him with a message, the angel could not preach the gospel Acts 10:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The angel told Cornelius, "You need to send for Peter and ask him to come.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I cannot till the ground because I am an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The human beings have been ordained to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ask Peter to come."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While there was no man on the earth to till the ground, God did not send the rain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was no man to work with God in coordination by human labor with the divine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must labor in coordination with God's divine labor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Day and night we must pray for our relatives and our friends.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must work on them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the rain will come.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not cooperate with God by tilling the ground, the rain will never come.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God does not waste His rain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When it comes, it comes to produce life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>3 No Life Had Grown Out of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This signifies that there was not yet any life, for life had not grown out of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since there was no one to till the ground and no rain had fallen, it was impossible to have life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>4 A Mist Went Up from the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground" v. 6 . This signifies that there was only something out of the earth to work on the earth; there was nothing from heaven coming down to cause the earth to grow out life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These four items compose the background of the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we approach these verses in an allegorical way, we will find them worthy to be in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I love Genesis 2:5-6.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we may understand that we need the rain and that God needs us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God needs our co-labor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then the rain from heaven will descend to mingle with the dust of the earth to produce life.</S>
