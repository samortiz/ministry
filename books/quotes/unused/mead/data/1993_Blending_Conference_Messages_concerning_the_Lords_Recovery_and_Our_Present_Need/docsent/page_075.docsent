   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST FOR HIS BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY IN HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is for His bountiful supply in His death and resurrection that the believers may live Christ and magnify Christ Phil 1:19b-21a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit mentioned in John 7.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time the Spirit was not yet, but at the time Paul wrote Philippians, the Spirit was.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the glorified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God before incarnation, but the Spirit of God compounded with the elements of Christ's incarnation, human living under the cross, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul experienced both the Lord's suffering in His human life and the Lord's life-giving resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, to Paul this Spirit was the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we live Christ and magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To magnify Christ is to show, declare, exalt, and extol Him without limitation, regardless of the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we become one with Christ in our life and living to such an extent that we and He live as one person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE SEVEN SPIRITS, THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT, FOR THE OVERCOMERS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>IN THE DEGRADATION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus far in this message we have seen the progression and the consummation of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Initially, the Spirit was of God for creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is outward and objective.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Next, as He entered into His relationship with man, He was the Spirit of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is subjective and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then He was the Holy Spirit to sanctify humanity for Christ's incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although He was the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit, He was also the Spirit who was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that some aspect of the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit of God became a life-giving Spirit with a new function not just to create outwardly, to merely be related to man, or even to sanctify man in the situation for Christ's incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now the Spirit has become the life-giving Spirit to enter into humanity to give life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the Lord Spirit, He is the Spirit who transforms the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the essential Spirit of God, He is the Spirit of life to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the economical Spirit of God, He is the Spirit of power to empower us to carry out God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to understand how one Spirit could have so many functions and carry out so many things in God's economy, the Old Testament type of the compound ointment is needed to reveal the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This compound Spirit is now the anointing Spirit, anointing us, flowing over us, to bring all the elements of this compound Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ, He is related to all the believers in the suffering of human life, the power of resurrection, and the bountiful supply, respectively.</S>
