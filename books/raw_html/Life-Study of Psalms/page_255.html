<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE SEEKING OF THE SONS OF KORAH<br>FOR THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL</H2><P>The subject of Psalm 85 is the seeking of the sons of Korah for the restoration of Israel. In verse 4 the psalmist prays, "Restore us, O God of our salvation,/And cause Your indignation toward us to cease." In verse 6 he goes on to ask, "Will You not again revive us,/That Your people may rejoice in You?" In verses 8 through 11 the psalmist writes about Jehovah's speaking peace to His people, about His salvation being near to those who fear Him, and about glory, lovingkindness, truth, and righteousness. Verses 12 and 13 conclude, "Indeed Jehovah will give what is good,/And our land will give its increase./Righteousness will go before Him/And make His footsteps a way to walk in."</P><P>This seeking for the restoration of Israel was based upon God's promise to Israel's forefathers to give land, peace, and many other good things to their descendants. Eventually, however, the sons of Korah experienced God's punishment and the desolation and degradation of God's people. Hence, in their seeking as recorded in this psalm they prayed for restoration. Surely this was good and also important, but we need to see what God would say about it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SEEKING OF DAVID<br>FOR HIS PERSONAL SALVATION</H2><P>Psalm 86 is concerned with the seeking of David for his personal salvation. As we read this psalm we need to pay special attention to verses 2, 11-13, and 15-16. In verse 2 David prayed, "Keep my soul; for I am godly;/Save Your servant who trusts in You, O You who are my God." In verse 16 he said, "Turn to me and be gracious to me;/Give Your strength to Your servant,/And save the son of Your maidservant." David's seeking for his personal salvation was important; however, it was important not for itself but for something else. We may use eating as an illustration. Eating is important not for its own sake but for something else. Likewise, it is important to be saved, but salvation is for something else, not for itself.</P>
