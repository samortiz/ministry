   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>On the Lord's Day after the Lord's table, I received a designated gift of two dollars that had been placed in the offering box.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The next day an older brother came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before he left he put an envelope on my table, saying, "Brother Lee, this is for you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then he left.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was ten dollars in that envelope.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later some registered mail came to me with a twenty-dollar money order from a city far away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I asked a young brother, who had lost his job and was staying with me, if he would go with me to the post office to get this money order cashed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On our way to the post office, I saw a bicycle store.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I went in this store and saw a bicycle for sale that seemed very appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The owner said that it would cost me a total of thirty-two dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I agreed to buy it, and he promised to deliver the bicycle to me in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After getting the money order cashed at the post office, we returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the evening, the store delivered the bicycle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I went to my room to kneel down, pray, and thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While I was thanking the Lord, He impressed me within to count how much money I had received since the Lord's Day evening.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Two dollars from the offering box, ten dollars from a brother, and a money order for twenty dollars totaled exactly thirty-two dollars!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I realized what the Lord had done, I thanked Him with tears for His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was the way we co-workers lived by faith in the early days of the Lord's recovery in China.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many were raised up to serve the Lord full-time, but the financial situation was not that good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, the co-workers had to pass through many trials of poverty, and many became sick.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In one meeting Brother Nee told us that about one-third of our co-workers had died of tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I pointed out in a previous chapter that Brother Nee used one-third of his income to support others for the Lord's work, but the need among us was great.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Nee's second brother was an expert in pharmaceutical chemistry, and he began to produce some medicine in China.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not know how to manage, so he asked Brother Nee to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Nee took that as an opportunity to do some business in order to supply the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was in this business a little over two years, from 1940 to 1942.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then there was a misunderstanding among the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I would say that this mostly came from ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some of the brothers who were working in the pharmaceutical factory were ambitious for higher position.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The misunderstanding became bigger and bigger and developed to such an extent that the entire church in Shanghai became rebellious toward Brother Nee with a few exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the same time, the Japanese military police were there trying to arrest Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This situation forced the church in Shanghai to "close its doors."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Japanese military police attempted to force the church in Shanghai to join the false Christianity association under the Japanese military police.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church could not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Also, within the church there was a big turmoil against Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, the church had no way to go on.</S>
