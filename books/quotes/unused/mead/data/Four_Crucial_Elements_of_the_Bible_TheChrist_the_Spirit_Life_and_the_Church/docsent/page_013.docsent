   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Being Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Timothy 2:5 says that Christ is also man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is more difficult to speak of Christ as man than to speak of Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man is very ordinary; there is almost nothing special about being a man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the apostle Paul said, "For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that the Lord Jesus is not only God but also man; hence, He is qualified to be the Mediator, the go-between, of God and men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This does not mean that He tired of being God and became a man instead, after which He became God again.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, in eternity He was God and not man, but two thousand years ago He was born of the virgin Mary through the Holy Spirit to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since then He is both God and man; He is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a man, the Lord Jesus was not remarkable in appearance; He was an ordinary man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One time He entered the city of Jericho, and people crowded around to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Zaccheus was there too, but being small in stature, he climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As He came to that place, Jesus looked up and spoke to Zaccheus Luke 19:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the Lord Jesus had been tall in stature, Zaccheus would not have needed to climb a tree in order to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, verse 5 indicates that the Lord may have recognized Zaccheus before Zaccheus recognized Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the Lord Jesus truly had a remarkable appearance, Zaccheus should have recognized Him first.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Israelites have a wrong concept in thinking that the Messiah is One who is excellent in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The prophet Isaiah said, "His appearance was marred more than that of any man,/And His form more than that of the sons of men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him,/Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him" Isa 52:14; 53:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the man Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is remarkable that in the record of the four Gospels we rarely find expressions such as benevolent, just, moral, and good, which are used to describe the sages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We see, however, a man whose living was a human living, yet it was so wonderful, extraordinary, and perfect that even expressions used by the followers of Confucius for human relationships, morality, and benevolence cannot fully depict it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although He lived a human life, His living far exceeded benevolence and morality; it is indescribable with human vocabulary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We always create an appropriate vocabulary to express what we have in our human culture, but in human society no one has ever lived a life that was like the one lived by the Lord Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, there is no human vocabulary to express that kind of living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Luke 10 a certain lawyer of the Pharisees stood up and put Jesus to the test.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was elated, considering himself to be wise, unashamed to be a teacher of the Mosaic law, who understood the essence of God's law, that is, to love God and to love one's neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wanting to justify himself before the Lord Jesus, he asked Him, "Who is my neighbor?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>25-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then the Lord Jesus told a story, a parable that was marvelous yet easy to understand vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>30-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It seems that He used that story to tell the lawyer, "You are elated and self-justified, yet you do not realize that you are the man who fell from Jerusalem to the place of curse and who was beaten on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Jewish religionists have beaten you half dead, stripped you, and left you alone, and the priests and the Levites, the moralists, have passed by and ignored you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only a good Samaritan, who was journeying, was moved with compassion toward you and has cared for you in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you still remember that formerly you said that I am a Samaritan and have a demon John 8:48-49 ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not have a demon, but I am definitely a Samaritan,' a lowly person whom you have despised and slandered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am your neighbor, and only I can take care of you by pouring oil and wine on your wounds to anoint and heal you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am the very neighbor who loves you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This story implies some deep matters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It shows us that we were fallen people "beaten half dead" and "stripped of our clothing."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Neither the religionists nor the moralists can save us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the Lord is the good Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was God who became a despised man to pass through human life for us and journey through human life as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When He came, He not only saved us but also healed and soothed us with oil and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, He carried us on His own beast, not in an impressive car or on a big horse but on a little donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He brought us to the inn, the church, not in a way to show off His mightiness but in a lowly manner.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord did not use a big hotel but a small inn as a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He entrusted us to the care of the small inn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He also promised that He will return and repay for us all the necessary expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Oh, what a sweet and lowly One He is!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually, good is not adequate to describe the sweetness of His conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His kindness, which is far beyond what man can measure, is more than just sacrificing oneself for others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We cannot find any expression on earth to adequately describe His beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is our Lord, the One who is altogether pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is truly a man, the Man among all men and the Man above all men, outstanding and unequaled in beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, His excellence is not in His appearance or merely in His great actions, but in many small things.</S>
