   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING GRACE BY HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 5:15: "But it is not that as the offense was, so also the gracious gift is; for if by the offense of the one the many died, much more the grace of God and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ have abounded to the many."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 17: "For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ."</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can also reign in life due to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 21 says, "In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 17: "But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which you were delivered."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a vital doctrine in our belief: that by faith, we are crucified with Christ, and the old man is annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not crucify myself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Christ was crucified, I was crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By this I am set free from sin, being no longer a slave to it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way I can reckon myself dead to sin and alive to God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a big doctrine that hinges on the person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>LIBERATED IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 7:24-25: "Wretched man that I am!</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here is a man who was constantly defeated by his own fleshly lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When he was at the end of his hopes, crying for deliverance, he saw the way of salvation: liberation by the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The power of liberation is also in the Lord.</S>
