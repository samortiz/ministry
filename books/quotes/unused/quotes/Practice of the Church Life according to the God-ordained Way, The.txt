If we attempt to read the Bible without the help of others' writings, we may not see the light concerning the divine revelation in the Bible
Wuest said that to prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is not to predict but to impart the divine revelation to others
To reach the high standard of prophesying unveiled in the Bible, there is a prerequisite, a condition that must be fulfilled first
In this message we will consider four items as a prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way
Although the economy of God is mentioned clearly and strongly in the Bible, many Christians do not know anything concerning God's economy
In 1 Corinthians 9:17 and Ephesians 1:10, the King James Version renders the Greek word oikonomia as dispensation
Although this rendering is not wrong, the proper significance and denotation of the word dispensation has been lost in the English language
When we speak of God's dispensing of Himself, the meaning is clear, but if we speak of God's dispensation, the meaning is obscure
Gods economy is for an organism and this organism is not for our interest benefit or attainments it is for Gods expression in His Trinity
Infuse my mind with Your thought, with Your thinking, and infuse my emotion with Your affection, with Your feeling'
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
God is expressed in the Father's love, in the Son's grace, and in the Spirit's fellowship, that is, in His Trinity
He said that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ for the producing of an organism, that is, the church
If we have never seen this, we will not have any aspiration to prophesy, because only prophesying can build up such an organism
When we see the economy of God, we realize that without prophesying, it is impossible to build up the church as an organism
The Body of Christ is constituted with the divine dispensing and transmitting of the Triune God into the believers as the church
The Body of Christ is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with the believers as the unique Body in the universe
Some of his messages spoken during that time were compiled by Angus Kinnear to form the book The Normal Christian Life
In every meeting he asked one of the trainees to give a testimony concerning how he came to know the Body of Christ
At the end of the synoptic Gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke the Lord commanded the disciples to go and preach the gospel
What is depicted in Ephesians 4 is not three-in-one but four-in-one one entity comprising the Spirit, the Lord, the Father, and the Body
In the whole universe there is such an entity: the Triune God the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father mingled with a group of men
Because the Triune God is the life element to this Body, it is not a dead corpse but an organic entity, an organism
When we read Paul's fourteen Epistles, we sense that in every page there is the dispensing of life into our spiritual being
In order to practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, we also need to realize the recovery of the Lord
The first major item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of Christ and of Christ as life to the believers for the church
The situation of today's Christianity is like that of the church in Laodicea in the Lord's epistle in Revelation 3:14-22
In the past years we have recovered Christ as everything and also Christ as life to us, the believers, for the church
In one of his publications Brother Nee said that he had a dream in which he saw that in every city of China there was a local church
Although he saw the local churches in his dream, under the Lord's sovereignty he was not allowed to see the fulfillment of that dream
In the Lord's recovery we do not have so-called pastors who speak, pray, and do everything for the other members in the churches
We all need to see that in the recovery, that is, in the local churches, we are all pastors and we are all pastored ones
The Southern Baptists boast of their revelation concerning baptism by immersion thus they even name themselves according to this revelation
According to Paul's teaching, differences among Christians are unavoidable, but no difference is qualified to be a factor of division
They also say that the emphasis of my ministry has changed, and that this has changed the nature of the Lord's recovery
According to them, once the apostles establish elders in a locality, the apostles should keep their hands off the church there
Similarly, from 1927 to 1952, Brother Nee remained in Shanghai, and the church in Shanghai was under his leading for twenty-five years
If someone insists on baptizing people by sprinkling, this would not be a justification for anyone to make a division
Another item of the prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the Godordained way is to avoid churchlessness and division
In their consideration, as long as they believe in the Lord Jesus, love Him, and are zealous for soul winning, that is sufficient
If we would practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, we must not neglect the goal of the God-ordained way the church
Even if a close relative such as our husband wife father mother brother or sister is a divisionmaker we must turn away from their division
Once the leprosy was healed, that man was declared clean, and he could come back into the fellowship of God's people
According to Leviticus 13 and 14, to discern whether or not a person was leprous or was cleansed from leprosy was a difficult thing
In the past four years they have spoken and even written a number of things that are divisive and very misleading
In the previous message we covered four points of the prerequisite of the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way
The fifth point of the prerequisite is to have a clear view concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery
The first was 17:9, which says, 'The heart is deceitful above all things/And it is incurable;/Who can know it'?
You should not pray only once but should pray again and again concerning what you have heard, until you have prayed thoroughly
In order to have a clear view concerning the present situation, we need to have a spirit of wisdom and revelation
To know God's economy intrinsically, we need more than knowledge and understanding; we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation
In Ephesians 3:14-19 Paul prayed for 'this cause': that we may know Christ in such a way that He will be able to make His home in our hearts
For this particular cause Paul did not pray lightly; rather, he prayed in an earnest and formal way, bowing his knees to the Father
We are small slaves of the Lord, and in His great house we should not say that we like or dislike certain things
When we attempt to get into the intrinsic nature of the twenty problems raised by the dissenting ones we can see that none of them is simple
To enter into the intrinsic nature of all these items, we must not have any opinion but must be full of discernment
Because of the rebellion in these past four and a half years, many negative things were spoken by the dissenting ones
In this message and the next, my intention is to fellowship with you concerning twenty 'problems' raised by the dissenting ones
The control has not been exercised so much directly, but very much indirectly, through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings'
It is true that my trainings conferences publications and tapes exercise a considerable control over thousands of people around the globe
Without such 'control,' many people might have done certain things that would have damaged themselves and their families
You must bring what you hear to the Lord; then the Lord will lead you to see what the intrinsic thing is within the shell
In 1 Corinthians 4:16, 11:1, and Philippians 3:17, Paul entreated the saints to imitate him because he imitated Christ
Sometimes, when a church has not submitted its standing order, the office asks the church to turn in its order
It is mainly concerning these kinds of things that the office has communicated with the churches to coordinate with them
The dissenters have also said that the ministry is a system, and all the churches have been systematized into this entity
The hall in Rosemead was built with funds from the sale of Elden Hall in Los Angeles, which was bought through my hand
The opposers also say that the churches that follow the ministry are 'ministry churches' and are no longer local churches
There Brother Nee said that the missionaries who went to China built up mission churches instead of local churches
Although Paul's ministry built up a number of churches, it is not right to call any of these churches 'Pauline churches'
The missionaries went to China and built up their mission churches, but our ministry has built up not 'ministry churches' but local churches
The dissenting brothers also said that after appointing the elders, the apostles should keep their hands off the local churches
From that year, 1927, he never left Shanghai; he stayed there for twenty-five years, until 1952, when he was put into prison
The dissenters adjusted their speaking, saying that according to God's Word, the apostles are always plural in number
One of them said that there are many apostles today and that he could give the names of a number of these apostles
They told people that before 1984 Witness Lee was right, but after 1984 he is wrong because he does not teach anything concerning life
At the end of 1988, one of the four leaders of the conspiracy spoke the same words to a group of brothers in San Diego
If the four Gospels are the teaching of the apostles, all the Epistles should also be the teaching of the apostles
Now, if whatever we speak is according to the New Testament, our teaching also is the apostles' teaching; it is not our teaching
Today the saints in the recovery should not follow me they should follow my teaching if my teaching is according to the apostles teaching
The Lord's recovery was raised up in China through Brother Nee's teaching for exactly thirty years, from 1922 through 1952
Of course, the foundation was laid by Brother Nee's teaching, but by whose teaching has the building up been carried out?
A number of years ago, some brothers took the way of the Lord's recovery, but they would not practice the Lord's table
Whether they liked to have the Lord's table or not, they had been received by the Lord, so we had to receive them
Gradually, the brothers and sisters who did not practice the Lord's table heard about it and wanted to practice it
If one brother is a Sabbath keeper and another brother practices meeting on the Lord's Day, the differences between them are outward
The ground of the church involves not allowing anything but the locality in which we live to separate us into local churches
If Paul did not do something in addition to the church meetings, why would he have needed to use a place which was like a school?
If there were no need for the saints to be trained, why would Paul stay in the city of Ephesus for three years?
They have said that we are too narrow, that we feel that only we are right, and that we do not receive other Christians
The dissenting ones have also raised an issue concerning the apostles' existence and how they relate with one another or work together
When one moves his arm, the shoulder, elbow, hand, and fingers move by keeping an excellent order according to their functions
Suppose the fingers would form a conspiracy and say to one another, 'Why should we fingers be under the shoulder'?
The opposing ones have also rejected the truth concerning deputy authority, claiming that they are under the direct headship of Christ
A principal is the head of a school, the teachers are under the principal, and the students are under the teachers
Because of policemen, the traffic is controlled and kept in a good order, thereby reducing traffic accidents and deaths
The opposing ones have taught the autonomy of the local churches and have accused us of trying to federate the churches
To say that all the local churches are separate in administration, in a certain sense, is right, but this is only one side
One brother in the past pointed out that if a speaker cannot speak something higher than himself, he is a poor speaker
In 1988 the dissenting ones claimed that there should be democracy among us since the church is the church of the saints
Democracy is better than autocracy in the political realm, but among God's people, neither of these ways should have any place
According to the Bible, there is no base, no reason, no excuse, no justification, and no vindication for any kind of division
If we teach the same thing as the New Testament teaches, our teaching is also a part of the apostles' teaching
They have neglected the Lord's word in John 16 which says, 'I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now
Some Christians also consider that only the words spoken directly by the Lord Himself in the four Gospels are the Lord's word
They do not believe that what was spoken after the four Gospels in Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation is the Lord's word
In the summer training of 1992, we intend to cover the Minor Prophets, and in the winter training, we will study the book of Job
By the end of 1994, if the Lord wills, the life-study of the entire Bible can be finished and will have taken twenty years to complete
Its head of gold, corresponding to the first beast in Daniel 7:3-4, signifies Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon
Because the head and feet of the great image signify Babylon, we may say that the entire human image is Babylon in four stages, four empires
The Babylonian locusts, the Medo-Persian locusts, the Greek locusts, and the Roman locusts did not let the nation of Israel have any peace
Some opposing ones have said that we can simply read the Bible itself without the help of the Recovery Version or the Life-study Messages
The words Trinity and triune are not written in the Bible; but the fact of the Trinity was discovered by the church fathers
They did a marvelous job concerning this matter, and through the centuries their interpretation has come to us
If we do not understand a certain part of the book of Genesis, we can go to the Life-study of Genesis for help
The Lord said through Amos that the wife of Amaziah would become a harlot and that his children would be killed
In the Old Testament, God first recognized the function of the prophet, then the function of the priest, and later the function of the king
Corinthians 14:1 says, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy'
Among the three functions of the prophet, the priest, and the king, the function of the prophet is the highest
For this reason, the prophets could reprove, instruct, and teach the kings , and they could also teach the priests
We all were born to be priests and kings, but we should not forget that another function, the function of the prophet, is waiting for us
1 Corinthians 14 tells us that the most useful function for building up the church as the Body of Christ is prophesying
The third kind of prophet is one who speaks for God and speaks forth God in the meetings of the church for the church's building up
Chapter twelve indicates that not all believers are prophets, but chapter fourteen indicates that all believers can be prophets
Wuest, in his New Testament translation, renders the word prophesies as 'imparts divine revelations to others'
In order to speak the word of God, we have to separate all the vile, worthless things from the precious things
If we do not keep the precious things separate from the vile things, we will lose the position to be the mouthpiece of God
To love the Lord, to be close to Him, and to be one with Him is another qualification for those who would prophesy
We first should practice to have a noise; then we gradually will be able to speak in a proper order so that our sound is a voice
The corporate Son includes all of the New Testament speakers; hence, it is the totality of the New Testament speakers
The first speaker is the individual Son, and the speakers who follow are the members of the Son, the members of His Body
Christianity has been used by the enemy of God to take away the speaking of God from the majority of the members of the church
The speaking in the church is no longer a corporate oracle among the saints; it has become the job of certain professionals
Today we are standing as the Lord's recovery, yet we are surrounded by the background and environment of Christianity
During the time of the Reformation, many felt the need to spread their ideas through the printed word, through articles and papers
Christianity is a total loss to the Lord in the sense of annulling the functioning of the members of the organic Body of Christ
There is nothing of the Lord's interest in either Protestantism or Catholicism, but how about the Lord's recovery?
When two hundred people meet together and their speaking is exhausted in less than one hour, is this not a shame to the Lord?
If you do not speak in the meeting, and another brother or sister asks you about the meeting, you may say that the meeting was poor
If you would say 'Amen' three times, at the beginning, middle, and end of the meeting, you would be stirred up
A boy may have many capacities by birth, but if he were restricted to lying on a bed, these capacities could not be cultivated
After the brothers finished their prayer, the relatives from the denominations asked whether the brothers were preachers or pastors
The relatives were surprised that merchants could pray so well, and they also admitted that they did not know how to pray
Among us in the Lord's recovery, the believers' spiritual function should be manifested to enrich the church's service in the Lord's economy
Some would say that they are not like other brothers who have been manifested to be very useful in the church's service
They should simply attend the church meetings and at the right time stand up and speak a word for the benefit of the church
If we have a meeting full of everyone speaking, such a meeting defeats the old way of Christianity and is the victory of the Lord's Body
The practice of one man speaking and the rest listening has annulled the capacity of the believers in the divine life
Another loss of not practicing to prophesy is that the believers are left unedified in undergrowth and in ignorance
The elders dare not touch these unattached brothers because they realize that they are very fragile, like thin glass, and are easily broken
The silence of the saints may promote some ambitious ones to build themselves up as a clerical class, a hierarchy
To prophesy is something from the heavens, to speak in a proper way is something on the earth, and to gossip is something from Gehenna
Because He is faithful, He will do everything for us according to His word, according to His promise, and according to His covenant
According to theology, they are taught that God is one, yet they may have difficulty concerning God also being three
The Greek word for hypostasis, the singular form of hypostases, refers to a support under, a support beneath, i
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the hypostases, the supporting substances, that compose the one Godhead
In order to understand the aspect of the essential Trinity, we have used the three words substance, element, and essence
Within this divine substance, there is the divine element, and within the divine element is the divine essence
In the three of the Divine Trinity, the Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence
Any kind of move or activity involves some kind of economy, plan, arrangement, or way to carry out a certain purpose
The Triune God has His essential aspect the essential Trinity, and His economical aspect the economical Trinity
These two spirits correspond with each other, communicate with each other, and are mingled with each other to be one spirit
Our understanding concerning the fall of man in Genesis has been printed in the Life-study Messages of Genesis
My burden in having the life-study of the entire Bible was to open the Bible to the Lord's children by interpreting it
The Spirit told Philip to join himself to the chariot, and as Philip ran up to the chariot, he heard the eunuch reading the prophet Isaiah
If you have a question and turn to the notes in the Recovery Version or the Life-study Messages, you can get the answer
At that time the Bible will not only have been inspired, written, and translated, but will also have been entirely interpreted
In Genesis 12 and 22, God prophesied to Abraham that in him and through his seed, all the nations would be blessed
If you do not know the truths, you will be short not only of material but also of the proper terminology when you prophesy
When we interpret the Word, we need to unfold it in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion
In order to practice prophesying, we not only need to learn the truths, but also need to have the experiences of life
The initial experience of life is the experience of the Spirit's sanctification that leads the sinners to repent
Many Christians do not know what justification and redemption are and what the difference is between these two items
Justification is God's application of Christ's redemption upon us to make us righteous in Christ, to justify us
We must not only be able to tell people the doctrine of regeneration but also be able to share our experience of regeneration
We must experience the death of Christ, and we must also experience the life-imparting of the resurrection of Christ
On the other hand, those who are silent must speak because the church meetings have been killed by their silence
God wants all of His people to speak, but Christianity has produced the clergy as the speaking class and the laity as the nonspeaking class
In the previous message, we fellowshipped that in order to prophesy we need to learn the truths and the experiences of life
According to Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, to be a functioning member of the Lord's Body is not an easy thing
Even if we have learned the truths and the experiences of life, there may still be other problems with our prophesying
There may be problems in our speaking with regard to the exercise of our spirit our mouth our voice our speed our gesture and our accent
When you speak in anger, without any consideration, without any fear, and without any care, you spontaneously release your spirit
We should realize that to exercise our spirit and to exercise our mouth are part of our job whenever we come to the meetings
If we come to the meetings without any stirring of the spirit and without any speaking, the meetings will be dead and will deaden everyone
If we exercise to speak with the proper sound and tone, the meeting will not be cooled down; rather, it will be stirred up by our speaking
To speak in the meetings, we must exercise our spirit, our mouth, our voice, our speed, our gesture, and our accent in a proper way
We must remember that when we meet together or contact people by visiting them that we are carrying out our kingly duty
In Matthew 28:19, the Lord Jesus as the King-Savior charged us, saying, 'Go therefore and disciple all the nations'
Some in the denominations heard about Brother Nee's visit and invited him to speak in a meeting of a conference they were holding
For this reason, there is the need of a few 'selahs,' that is, a few short stops, when we exercise our voice to speak
By the fellowship in this message we can see that we need instruction learning and exercise to speak for the Lord in the most effective way
A coach may coach his players, but when they practice, often they are able to play the game much better than the coach
In the previous message we covered the exercising of our spirit, our mouth , and our voice in the practice of prophesying
No doubt, this was a reference to the exercise of athletes in the Olympic games, for in Paul's time the Olympic games were prevailing
Do not think that we are merely common persons, sinners, who have been accepted and regenerated by God to remain in our present state
Many Christians, when they come to a Christian meeting, do not consider it important to bring a Bible, and most do not like to come early
If a meeting is scheduled to begin at 7:30, very few would begin to come to the meeting at 7:00, a half hour before the meeting
If we would come to the meeting early and exercise ourselves to pray, sing, and praise the Lord, this would burn the meeting
In giving a message, the most difficult thing is not only to find a subject but also to find the proper way to begin the speaking
In Chefoo, in Shanghai, in Taiwan, and here in Anaheim, a number of times the atmosphere in the prayer meeting was low
To praise the Lord six or seven times at the Lord's table is not too much, but it all depends on how we exercise
When we pray a number of times in the Lord's table meeting, we need to consider how we will begin and how we will carry out our prayer
We may think that because God is almighty, He can simply say, 'Let the whole world be saved,' and it will be so
We do not need to labor to bring people to salvation, or to set up a training or a meeting to teach people the truth'
After the three and a half years of His ministry, He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive, complicated death
Why would God not use the angels to visit all the corners of the backward countries to proclaim the gospel to them?
You may be very eloquent, smart, and excellent in speaking, yet after your speaking you may not have released the truth
On the other hand, a person may be very stupid, but in giving a message he may do a good work in presenting the truth
When he acts, an actor dresses himself and conducts himself in a manner that is different from what he is normally
When we come to the meeting, we must be active; this is not only our duty and our responsibility but also our obligation
As an illustration of the proper way to begin a speaking, we may open in this way: 'As Christians we need to be transformed in everything
If we use an outline in our speaking, when we stand up to speak, we should not drop our head to look at our outline
When we speak with an outline, we should avoid dropping our head and looking down at the outline before speaking
We all have our natural way, and we not only allow our natural way to act, but we also trust in our natural way
Give us a seeking heart and, Lord, a sober mind, even an open spirit, open to You and to Your way, to Your economy, to Your speaking
Although God came to visit man and came down upon man as the Spirit of Jehovah, God still remained by Himself, leaving man alone
Jesus Christ as the God-man and His all-inclusive death are the fifth and sixth major items in the history of the universe
Christ's resurrection, the church, and the New Jerusalem are the last three of the nine major items of the history of the universe
The Old Testament says Jehovah's Spirit came upon the prophets or that the burden of Jehovah's word came upon them
When He came to His disciples on the day of resurrection, He came with a body that could be touched by their fingers
In Revelation 1:12-13 John saw the Son of Man, after His resurrection and ascension, walking among the golden lampstands
The matter of prophesying, or speaking for God, in the principle of incarnation is seen clearly in the writings of Paul
Without the training it would have been impossible to send sixty brothers and sisters to Russia in less than six months
During this time they like to hear the saints speak concerning the Bible God Christ and the church which consummates in the New Jerusalem
God's economy in faith comprises only God, Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem
If you know all these truths and you know how to exercise yourself in keeping the principle of incarnation, wherever you go you can speak
After speaking many times in each meeting for half a year, they can reduce their speaking to allow others to have more time
In the previous two messages we have seen that we need to exercise our spirit, our mouth , and our voice in the practice of prophesying
If we speak with little or no gesturing, our speaking will appear to be unnatural and lifeless, and it will not be attractive
The practice of pray-reading and reading portions from The Holy Word for Morning Revival has been a great help to many of the saints
We also need to practice by composing our inspirations into a short message for our speaking in the practice of prophesying
When we pray-read the Word, we exercise our spirit, and the indwelling Spirit is stirred up by our pray-reading
Her speaking did not result from an instant 'inspiration' but issued from an accumulation of the word that had been stored in her being
Finally, we all need to seek the infilling of the Spirit and the outpouring of the Spirit upon us as power from on high to be our impact
Most Christian groups select only a small group of believers and send them to a seminary to become educated according to their theology
In contrast in the United States if we are able to get one person saved and baptized and brought into the church life we become very excited
For the past eighteen years it has been difficult to gain an adequate increase, especially among the Caucasians
In both cities we have thirty full-time serving ones laboring to visit people, to feed people, to nourish people, and to perfect people
No other group would do this; they all still employ the old way of one preacher taking care of one congregation
The promise, the hope, of the Lord's recovery in Russia is not with the older people but with the college students
It may be that after ten years they will be prepared to come to the United States to re-evangelize this country
In Russia there is a great need for brothers and sisters who can go to visit people and speak to them about Jesus
They have been sitting under the ministry for many years, listening to the messages on the books of the New Testament and the Old Testament
For many years mainland China was closed to Taiwan, but in recent years mainland China has been opened to Taiwan
After we get one saved, we need to consider him our spiritual babe, our spiritual child, and we should consider ourselves his nursing mother
They were concerned that this country would fall just as the Roman Empire fell, because of its decadent and luxuriant living
The priesthood in the Old Testament was not a priesthood of gospel preaching, but a priesthood of offering the sacrifices
In the Old Testament priesthood the priests got cattle from the herd and sheep from the flock in order to offer them to God
All the Gentiles gained by Paul through his preaching of the gospel became saved and regenerated sinners as members of Christ
Cain was rejected by God because he did not offer Christ to God; rather, he offered his own work, typified by the fruit of the ground
In the prayer meeting there is much prayer for the gospel preaching and the fruit-bearing, but the saints do not go out
On the Lord's Day the church in Taipei has over one hundred district meetings, with more than five thousand attendants
Until about two or three years ago they did not take the definite step to go out for the practice of the New Testament gospel priesthood
As a result of his speaking, one-third, or more than seventeen hundred saints, were stirred up to practice the going out
The Lord's answer was that if she did not know, she should follow the footsteps of the flock and feed her kids beside the shepherds' tents
We should not simply seek the Lord by ourselves; as we pursue the Lord, we should bring our 'kids,' our spiritual children, with us
Third, after one has been saved and nourished for several months, he surely will have a certain amount of growth in life
For the group meetings, we can group together a number of the saints who have grown in life by being nourished
To group the saints together in a spontaneous way is another definite step in the practice of the God-ordained way
They need to pick up the definite step of studying improving and carrying out one thing that is to prophesy in the Lords Day morning meeting
Some of the young people need to take the lead to set up a model, an example, of how to prophesy in the church
To get people saved, you must have 'thick skin'; that is, while you are preaching the gospel, you must have no sense of shame
One day Brother Nee told us publicly that if we did not have thick skin, we were finished in the matter of gospel preaching
Although she was naturally a shy person, when she stood on the platform before a thousand people, she had the power and the boldness
To nourish and cherish people, we must have patience, we must have love, and we must give them whatever we want to give ourselves
If we are not able to give people what we want to give ourselves, we are not qualified to nourish the new ones
In our practicing and learning of the God-ordained way, we should not care for problems, hardships, and frustrations
If we would begin to practice one step of the God-ordained way, after a short time we may encounter a number of problems
In practicing the definite steps of the God-ordained way, we must do so with faithfulness, endeavoring, patience, endurance, and much prayer
If we do anything by taking the way of laboring, struggling, and energizing ourselves, we will surely have a success
Within half a year he stirred up the entire church in Taipei, which has over five thousand regular attendants each Lord's Day morning
Through this stirring up, one-third of the saints began to practice the regular going out for the preaching of the gospel
Another brother in Taipei picked up this burden, and today the saints in his district in Taipei are excelling in the matter of prophesying
Taipei has almost sixty brothers' and sisters' houses, with nearly four hundred college-age young people living in those houses
Finally, every evening before going to bed they have an evening prayer time, along with some fellowship concerning the truth
The coworkers also share with the students concerning how to be a priest of the gospel by contacting people and preaching the gospel to them
Because they are so burdened for their group meetings, once a week the students fast and pray for the new ones in the group
The full-timers in Taipei have been successful mainly because they have transferred the burden of the work to the students
All of us who are now in the recovery should pick up a burden to practice certain steps of the God-ordained way
We should endeavor to practice the group meetings with no formality, no religious service, and no religious worship
We should meet together simply as believers in Christ coming together to fellowship, making everything so natural
All the attendants in the group meetings have the right to ask questions mutually, and everyone has the right to answer mutually
In this way the saints' knowledge of the truth will increase every week, and they will be educated and perfected
Those who are burdened for the practice of the group meetings can come together to pray and even fast for the group meetings
Those who have a burden to improve the prophesying in the church meetings must bear the burden and get others to work with them
As we have mentioned previously, the first item in the practice of the God-ordained way is the universal priesthood of the gospel
Because of age or physical weakness or some other circumstances, many saints are unable to go out regularly to contact sinners
Like a nursing mother , we need to exercise our patience, our endurance, and our love to feed the newly saved ones
A number of saints can spend time to come together to study the situation and the need and to find out the secrets
We need wisdom to discern whether we should speak to them quickly or slowly, or whether we should be stern or mild in our tone
To pray is not only to entreat the Lord to do things for us but also to cause our spirit to be exercised and strengthened
If we contact people in society, we will find that a great number of people like to have a good religion for them to rest on
On the one hand, man has a heart to seek after God; on the other hand, man has a need for something that can be called religion
According to the teaching of Christianity, if a person has some trouble, he has Someone, a Savior, to whom he can go
It is easy to attract people into such a religion, especially in a wealthy and highly developed country like the United States
