   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Falling Down in the Light Shanba</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was led by the Lord to leave Sian and return to Shanba on November 8.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I stayed in Peking for more than ten days; then I spent six days in Guisui, thirteen days in Salachi, and seven days in Baotou.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have served a little in the churches in these localities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By the Lord's mercy, I understand a little of what it means to fall down in the light on the way to Damascus!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the past I have spoken, discussed, and prayed, but I did not know about this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I now understand something of the meaning of falling down.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we see the Lord, we fall, our views fall, our personality falls, our prejudice falls, our good judgment falls, our good criticism falls, our great zeal for the Lord falls, our work for the Lord falls, our thoughts fall, our spiritual haughtiness falls, our falseness falls, and our incorrectness falls; everything falls inwardly and outwardly!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only those who have fallen in this way can be used by the Lord and can coordinate in the Body to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only those who have fallen down in the light are in fear of their selves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the Lord allows, I will visit the brothers and sisters in the localities in western Suiyuan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I deeply feel that I am useless and unable to supply life to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please remember me in your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chao Xu-dong</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>December 9, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Gospel Always Has a Way Bangbu</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The house we meet in has two rooms and can only contain about sixty people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are now almost completely filled.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We desperately need a larger meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are praying earnestly and hope to be able to get a place in a good location with quiet surroundings and room to seat more than two hundred fifty people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also want a large yard to leave room for expansion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Great blessing cannot be brought in without a large vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But there are not many large houses in Bangbu.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We look to God to give us the best arrangement according to the needs of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Recently the brothers who are scattered throughout the northern regions of Anhwei like Yinshang, Jieshou, Shouxian, Tienjiaan, and Zhengtang have gradually begun to fellowship with us by letter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They really feel lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they discovered that Bangbu had an assembly, they wanted to come here to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is particularly true of the elderly brother, Yang Hua-cheng.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After he returned to Yinshang, he testified of what he had received to the brothers in the China Inland Mission, and many were willing to fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the geographical situation, it seems that God has measured the northern region of Anhwei province to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There have been three baptism meetings here, and with the original brothers there is now a total of more than sixty people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are forty-five people who meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Thursday night edification meeting is on what we have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We speak concerning basic matters, but we feel that our speaking is not focused enough, and we cannot grasp the central points.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Recently, we have clearly seen that the Lord has begun to work in Huaiyuan especially in the Southeastern Medical College which moved from Shanghai .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A few brothers and sisters from Bangbu and Shuxian passed their entrance examination, and now the college has twelve or thirteen brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They need a meeting, but they lack responsible ones and a place to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are many saved people in the school's Christian fellowship group.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A few have come to Bangbu to fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They all have a heart to pursue the Lord and are suffering because they cannot find a spiritual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A sister is planning to move to Huaiyuan to start a soy milk factory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have asked her to rent two more houses and begin prayer meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are also willing to make some time to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have begun to apply the methods from the book Seen and Heard in the gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We always ask a newly saved brother to give a testimony of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord is constantly adding saved ones to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Praise the Lord that His gospel has a way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Han Zeng-wu, Shao Yi-ming, Shu Pei-zhi</S>
