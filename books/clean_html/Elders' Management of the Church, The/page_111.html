<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Leading Others to Accept the Cross</H2><P>This is an absolutely necessary lesson. There is a reason for me to put this point as point number thirteen. Up to this point, you have to help the brothers and sisters to practically, seriously, and deeply learn the lesson of the cross. The things to deal with are the carnality, the flesh, the ambition, the haughty aspirations, and the desire to accomplish something for oneself. There is the need for the cross to break the desire for greatness in a person. By this point, a person has somewhat become a vessel. There is a certain amount of danger and a great temptation in being a vessel. It is easy to go from being a vessel to becoming famous. On a larger scale, a person can become renowned in Christianity. On a smaller scale, that one can become the pivotal figure in a local church. He can manipulate the situation and can influence the brothers and sisters. By that time, you have to help such a one to learn the lesson of the cross. The carnality, the flesh, the ambition, the aspirations, the self-interest, and the desire to be great must all be terminated on the cross.</P><P>Brothers, I have been severely taught in this matter. I know that there is such a need here. If we do not do this, all the labor we have exerted in the past will again go to waste. Without the cross, points one to twelve will all be wasted, and the person will be damaged. He will be damaged by greatness. You have spent so much energy and effort to perfect such a one. In the end, his ambition and aspirations will cause your labor to disappear into thin air. In addition, you will end up with one more problem in the church. This one has learned something; he is able to manipulate the situation and can influence everyone. Consider this pride, this striving for self-interest, this desire to be great, to be superficial, and to be famous. Will it damage such a person alone? Will it hurt him alone? This will damage the whole church. Therefore, up to this point, you have to learn this lesson, and you have to help him learn this lesson. Otherwise, the coordination will be affected.</P><P>If there is no cross in the coordination, the church will be without any protection. As far as you are concerned, you may have the mercy to supply others the grace despite whether they are great or small. But as far as they are concerned, they are damaged. And as far as the church is concerned, the loss is even greater! Hence, for their sake, for the church's sake, you have to help them learn the lesson of the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Leading Others to Learn Brokenness</H2><P>A person who has accepted the cross is not necessarily one who is broken. The cross solves the problems of man before man. Brokenness solves the problems of man before God. Our natural strength must go through God's breaking. The problems before men are the carnality, the flesh, the ambition and aspiration, the desire for achievement, fame, and greatness in the church. But even if you have solved these problems, you have to remember that the natural strength in serving the Lord must be broken by Him. You have to allow God to touch you deeper, to touch the hollow of your thigh, so that you would fall down. You have to help the brothers to this stage. Otherwise, the coordination will not be long-lasting. They can coordinate with you, but very soon they will be damaged. For this reason, you have to help the brothers to accept the breaking and to be a person subdued before God.</P>
