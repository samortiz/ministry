   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GENUINE PREACHING BEING A LIFE OF CRUCIFIXION AND RESURRECTION TO MANIFEST CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have said, John 12 shows us the way for Christ to be increased.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can one grain of wheat be increased into many grains?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We often speak of verse 24, but most of the time we think that this verse applies only to Christ as the one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must realize that in principle this verse is also for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In these days, we at least have a heart to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do we realize that to preach the gospel is to have Christ increased through us?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How then can this one grain be multiplied?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not merely by telling our neighbor, "You have to realize that you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God loves you, and I love you too.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You need Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is nothing wrong with this, but it is too short.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We preach the gospel not only by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While we speak with our neighbor, the enemy Satan, the subtle one, may work within him, causing him to think, "You say I have not been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you mean that you are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the difference between you and me?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Are you better than I?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I am a poor sinner, how about you?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To me, you are more poor."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The subtle one puts many questions within that person, so this kind of preaching may not work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot convince such a person, and he can point his finger and ask, "What about you and your mother, your wife, your brother, and all your in-laws?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You have too many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me tell you how to deal with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not need your preaching; you need my preaching."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes our relatives, neighbors, schoolmates, and colleagues are polite.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They would not say a word outwardly, but they say much within themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes, even many times, the more we preach, the more nothing happens, and people become disgusted with our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this case it may be better to be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can the one grain be increased into many grains today?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is by a real crucified life, by being a crucified person, dying day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here is the universal principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Where there is the divine death, there is the divine resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we simply will die, Christ will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is by this process of death and resurrection that Christ is manifested to our friends and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There may be no need for us to preach very much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are lifted up on the cross, this will attract people to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need a real testimony by experiencing the death and resurrection of Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not have a real testimony in life, then the more we preach, the more we will hinder the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many dear Christians simply cannot preach the gospel to their relatives because they have no testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one knows our lives better than our relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we cannot have a proper testimony in life through death and resurrection, then the more we live in a place, the more all the neighbors will keep away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The real preaching is a life of crucifixion and resurrection to manifest Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This convinces people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not argue with people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more we argue, the more we lose the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we must convince people by our dying, our daily walk, and our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Throughout the last two thousand years the crucifixion, the death, and the cross of Christ have been speaking to many hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need the death of Christ, we need the cross, and we need the crucifixion to speak Christ more than we need our mouths to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This does not mean that we do not need to open our mouth to say something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, the most basic thing is the life testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to die; there is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not argue with your neighbors, your schoolmates, or your classmates; rather, die to them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it can never be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This multiplication is the very outreach of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We Christians are always dreaming.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is no need to seek the miraculous gift of dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are all experts in dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We think that if we pray three nights and three days, we will be empowered, powerful to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In actuality, there is no such thing; I say a thousand times, no. Rather, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, there is no multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Regardless of how many days, nights, months, or even years we pray, the answer to proper prayer is, "You have to die."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you are going to have the multiplication, if you are going to have the increase, you have to die.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Unless the grain dies, there is no possibility of any kind of increase.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I say again, this does not mean that we do not need preaching by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need it, but the preaching by speaking must be based on the crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The crucified life must open the way for our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Otherwise, our life will only close the way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Regardless of how much we speak from our mouth, our speaking will only make it worse.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we do not have the life testimony, it is better to shut our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The way of increase is death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It seems that John 12:24 applies only to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we read on, however, we come to verses 25 and 26, which clearly tell us that the principle of verse 24 is also for us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are going to serve the Lord, we have to be in the place where He is.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is in the way of death; He is on the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, we have to be there too.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We all have to see that the real gospel preaching is for the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Christ is in us, so we are a grain.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Within us there is life, but there is also the outer shell.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This shell has to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It must be put into the earth to die there.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then the inner life, that is Christ Himself, will be manifested, and by this manifestation, Christ will be imparted into others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This imparting is His very increase.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not simply a matter of preaching the doctrine of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is a matter of imparting Christ into others by a life that is crucified and resurrected.</S>
