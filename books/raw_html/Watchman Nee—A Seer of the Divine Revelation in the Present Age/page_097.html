<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Letter Six</H2><P>May 25, 1972<br>Eldest Sister Pin-cheng,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Tomorrow, I will be reassigned from Feng-Shu-Ling to Shan-Shia-Pu Farm. When you come, do not buy your ticket for Feng-Shu-Ling. Instead buy your ticket for Shan-Shia-Pu. It is a little further away from Feng-Shu-Ling, at the next station. I have sent you one letter before this one. I do not know if you have received it. I hope to see you soon.</P><P>I wish you well.</P><P>Shu-tsu</P><P style="text-align:center">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>This letter to his sister-in-law shows that on May 26, he was to be transferred from the farm in Feng-Shu-Ling to another more remote farm in Shan-Shia-Pu, one station away.</P><P style="text-align:center">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Letter Seven</H2><P>May 26, 1972<br>Hsing-tao,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>While in Feng-Shu-Ling I wrote you a letter, hoping you could obtain a certificate for me from the commune administration, which would clearly indicate your desire to receive me and guarantee my living. (You know my eldest sister is supplying my daily needs.) Your attitude should be firm and clear.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>[Series of long dashes supplied by Watchman Nee here.]</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Today I was transferred from Feng-Shu-Ling to the Convalescent Group at Pai-Yun-Shan. I hope you will try your best to do this and give me a reply. The certificate should be sent directly to Group No. 14, Pai-Yun-Shan Farm. In the salutation it should be the commune administration writing to Pai-Mao-Ling Farm, Kwang-Te County, Anhwei province. But when you mail it, you should address it to Group No. 14, Pai-Yun-Shan Farm, Kwang-Te County, Anhwei province.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>I hope very much to go back to my relatives. Please make an effort.</P><P>I wish you well,</P><P>Shu-tsu</P><P style="text-align:center">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
