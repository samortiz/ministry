On the other hand, the Holy Spirit is creating a new nature and a new character in us little by little, with its new living and new habits
Man's own effort to tear himself down will only result in outward adornment; it will only hinder the growth of the spiritual life
In order to clarify the breaking and constituting work in us, we will use the phrase the discipline of the Holy Spirit for now
God arranges the outward environment, but the Holy Spirit translates this arrangement into something inward and applies it to us
