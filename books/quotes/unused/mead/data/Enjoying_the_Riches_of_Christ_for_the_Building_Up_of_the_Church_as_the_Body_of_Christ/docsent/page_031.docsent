   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS WISDOM TO US FROM GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hallelujah, we are in Christ Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is of God that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We were not born in Him, but we were made to be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ was made wisdom to us from God as three items: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Righteousness is for our past, sanctification is for our present, and redemption is for our future.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ as Our Righteousness for Our Past</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As an older person, I dare not look at my past.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even a young man of twenty years of age realizes that his short past is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>None of us has a good past.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because our past is awful, we need Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the real remedy, the real cure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hallelujah, we have Christ as our righteousness for our past!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we should no longer say that our past is awful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can say, "Our past is glorious, because our past is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Formerly, our past was awful because of our wrongdoings, but now it is glorious because of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ as Our Sanctification for Our Present</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our past is glorious, but what about our present?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is our righteousness for our past, and Christ is our sanctification for our present.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes our present is awful, but we have to say, "Hallelujah, I have Christ as my sanctification!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sanctification is more than holiness; it is holiness "to us," not in a doctrinal way, but in a subjective and experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whereas holiness is the thing itself, sanctification is holiness becoming our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not something objective but something very personal and subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose a brother has a wife who gives him a hard time, irritating him, humiliating him, and causing him to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The teaching of fundamental Christianity would tell him that he must love his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps on his wedding day he was told by his pastor that he must love his wife according to Ephesians 5:25.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In his hard circumstance, he may exercise his mind to remember to love his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, this does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He should not try to remember this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When his wife gives him a hard time, he should call, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to enjoy Christ, apply Christ, and appropriate Christ in our situations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many of us can testify that this truly works.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way Christ becomes our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead of losing our temper we gain Christ as our holiness in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sanctification is Christ becoming holiness in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Among Christians today there is much talk about sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, sanctification is a person Jesus Christ to be experienced today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we experience Christ today, that is a part of our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sanctification includes many things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the present trend of this age, very few women can overcome the department stores.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As they look in the windows and at the showcases, they get captured, and eventually they buy some of the up-to-date fashions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then when they wear them, they lose their sanctification; instead of experiencing sanctification they experience worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What should the sisters do?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a sister looks at the show windows of the department stores, she should call, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if she is already at the counter, it is not too late.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She can still say, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This may cause her to leave what she has picked up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then if she continues to call, the Lord within her may tell her to go home and forget about the store.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In such a way she will experience Christ as her daily and hourly sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not a mere doctrine; this is Jesus as our personal sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many young men today like to have long hair.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a brother has long hair, do you believe that people will realize that Christ is his sanctification?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I do not believe so.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some long-haired Christians today call themselves "Jesus People."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, these people of Jesus are not wearing Jesus; they are wearing their long hair.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If a young man with long hair calls, "O Lord Jesus," as he combs his hair, the Lord Jesus may say, "Cut it."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even the length of our hair is not a matter of regulation or outward correction; it is a matter of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Jesus Christ should be our haircut.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the experience of sanctification in all matters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many Christians today are poor because they have the doctrines, but nothing is effective.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They have the gifts, but there is no change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Day by day, we need to experience Christ as our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every aspect of our daily walk must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our haircut must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our shopping must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our clothing must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our attitude must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our relationship with our family must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even the pair of shoes we wear must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this way Christ becomes prevailing in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the experience of life with Christ as our daily sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus, we are sanctified, separated, marked out, and absolutely different from the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our shopping and our clothing must be different from that of the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is not merely my teaching; it is our experience of Christ as our daily holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christ as Our Redemption for Our Future</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Christ is also for our future.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some day He will come, and we will be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>That will be the redemption of our body Rom 8:23; Phil 3:21 .</S>
