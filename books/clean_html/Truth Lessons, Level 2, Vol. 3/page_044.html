<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>41. The Author of Salvation</H2><P>Hebrews 2:10 says, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings." The last step of God's great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory. In order to accomplish this, God needs an example, a model, to be the Author of salvation. Hence, He made Jesus perfect through sufferings. However, this does not mean that there was any imperfection of virtue or attribute in Jesus, but only that the completing of His experience of human sufferings was needed to make Him fit to become the Author, the Leader, of His followers' salvation. As the self-existing and ever-existing God, the Lord Jesus is complete from eternity to eternity. However, He needed to be perfected through the processes of incarnation, the partaking of human nature, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension that He might be qualified to be God's Christ and our Savior.</P><P>The salvation spoken of here saves us from our fallen state into glory. Jesus, as the Pioneer, the Forerunner (Heb. 6:20), took the lead to enter into glory, and we, His followers, are taking the same way to be brought into the same glory, which was ordained by God for us (1 Cor. 2:7; 1 Thes. 2:12). He cut the way, and we are now taking the way. Hence, He is not only the Savior who saved us from our fallen state but also the Author, the Pioneer, who took the lead to enter into glory that we may be brought into the same estate.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>42. The Forerunner</H2><P>Hebrews 6:19-20 says, "Which we have as an anchor of the soul, both secure and firm and which enters within the veil, where the Forerunner, Jesus, has entered for us, having become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec." Anchor signifies that we are on a stormy sea. As the Forerunner, the Lord Jesus took the lead to pass through the stormy sea and enter the heavenly haven. As such a Forerunner, He cut the way to glory. The heavens (4:14; 9:24), into which the Lord Jesus entered, are today the Holy of Holies within the veil. Our hope, as a secure and firm anchor, has entered there, and we may now enter there in our spirit (10:19-20). Therefore, we need to follow Him in our spirit and go on to enter the Holy of Holies that we may reach God's New Testament goal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>43. The Apostle</H2><P>Hebrews 3:1 says, "Consider the Apostle...of our confession, Jesus." The Apostle is the One who was sent to us from God and with God (John 6:46; 8:16, 29). As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness. This is typified by Moses, who came from God to serve the house of God. Christ as the Apostle was sent to take care of and to be over the house of God. In His humanity Christ is the good material for God's building, and in His divinity He is the Builder. He is not only a part of God's house; He is even the Builder of God's house. Today in the church as the house of God we may practically enjoy and experience Christ as such an Apostle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>44. The High Priest</H2><P>Hebrews 4:14 says, "Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession." The Lord Jesus first was sent from God to us through incarnation to be our Apostle, our Author, and our Leader. He then went back from us and with us to God through resurrection and ascension to be our High Priest to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs.</P><P>As our great High Priest, Christ is excellent, wonderful, glorious, and most honorable. He is great in His person, work, and attainment. He is the God-man, who is merciful and faithful (Heb. 2:17) and who is fully qualified to be our High Priest, continually ministering God and the riches of God's life to us. He was appointed the High Priest not according to the powerless letters of law but according to the powerful element of an indestructible life (7:16), which nothing can destroy or dissolve. This life is endless, being the eternal, divine, uncreated life and the resurrection life, which passed through the test of death and Hades (Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18). It is by such a life that Christ ministers today as our High Priest.</P><P>"Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them" (Heb. 7:25). Christ as our High Priest undertakes our case by interceding for us. He appears before God on our behalf and prays for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose. "For such a High Priest was also fitting to us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners and having become higher than the heavens" (v. 26). In His ascension Christ passed through the heavens, and He is higher than the heavens, far above all the heavens. Christ, as the High Priest in the heavens, brings us into heaven, from the earthly outer court into the heavenly Holy of Holies. As the One who ministers as a priest in heaven, Christ is the Minister of the heavenly tabernacle (Heb. 8:2), who ministers heaven (which is not only a place but also a condition of life) into us that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth, as He did while He was here.</P>
