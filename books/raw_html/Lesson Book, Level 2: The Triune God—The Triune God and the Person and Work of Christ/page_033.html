Jesus was the Triune God manifested in the flesh. From His birth to His death the Lord lived on the earth for about thirty-three and a half years. The Lord's life described in the four Gospels shows us that He lived as a genuine man. Furthermore, His human living was perfect, without flaw. His living was according to the finest and highest standard. In this lesson we will see how Christ's humanity is the pattern for our own human living. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CHRIST BEING A GENUINE MAN</H2><P>We saw previously how Christ's incarnation shows that He was a genuine man. His childhood and older years also prove that He was indeed a man. As a baby, Jesus was circumcised, named, and offered to God on His eighth day. Jewish law required this for all Jewish boys. Philip saw Him as "the son of Joseph, from Nazareth," a real man (John 1:45). His own countrymen called Him "this man." They knew Him as "the carpenter's son," with a "mother," "brothers," and "sisters" (Matt. 13:54-56). These facts strongly prove that He is a man, not a bit different from an ordinary man. He ate with men (Matt. 9:10-11; Luke 7:36; John 12:2). He, "being wearied from the journey" and being thirsty, asked a woman for a drink (John 4:6-7). He "wept" as did those who were present at that time (John 11:33, 35). All these actions prove that He is a man. </P>
