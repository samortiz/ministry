The last two messages which reveal that Gods desire is to gain the church as the mystery of Christ were given on January 22 and 24 of 1963
All of these key words and phrases, and the answers to all these questions, reveal what God planned to do in eternity past
In the old days, when Chinese people saw someone that they knew, they did not say, 'Good morning, how are you'?
They believe that Christ is life, light, and many other things, but they do not know Him as these things in their experience
As a result of this bombing there were many refugees up and down the railway lines and at the stations and the trains were often not on time
They knew that as long as the sky was covered by clouds, the Japanese bombers would not be able to see the train, and they would be safe
When the people on the train heard these words, they said to me, 'Sir, you are very deep in religious matters'
God planned in eternity past that He would be manifested through Christ and that through Christ He would be experienced by man
Through our troubling situations and the working of the Holy Spirit within us, we experience Christ as our heavenly way
In this message we would like to consider several of the major verses found in the four chapters of the book of Colossians
The first point is that God has transferred us out of the authority of darkness-the kingdom of Satan-into the kingdom of the Son of His love
If we spend some time to read Colossians 1:13-19 and to meditate over these fourteen items, we will see what a Christ we have
God's kingdom has been committed to Him, He is the Son of God's love, and He is the image of the invisible God
With regard to creation, He is the Firstborn of all creation and all things were created in Him, through Him, and unto Him
He is also the One who has the first place in all things and the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells
By meditating on these fourteen items revealed in Colossians 1:13-19, we will have a deeper realization concerning who Christ is
Not merely do all wisdom and knowledge dwell in Christ, but even more, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge dwell in Him
We need to pay careful attention to these four expressions: received, walk in, having been rooted, and being built up
In the original Greek this expression-carries you off as spoil-conveys the thought of being captured away and made prey of
There are so many things in this world that are trying their best to make us a prey and take us away from Christ
In these two verses we see that food drink feast days a new moon and the Sabbath are all shadows and figures the reality is Christ Himself
In addition, this Christ who is our life will be manifested in glory, and when this happens, we will be manifested with Him
Verses 15 through 17 say, 'And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body; and be thankful
Whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him'
Within, the peace of Christ will arbitrate, and without, what we express with our mouth will be the word of Christ
We need to be filled with the word of Christ to the extent that we express Christ with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs
Verse 6 says, 'Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one'
The third point in the line of thought in Colossians is that since Christ is the mystery of God, God has made Him to be everything
He is the Son of God's love, the image of the invisible God, and the One within whom all the fullness of God dwells
In addition to being the Firstborn of all creation, Christ is the One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created
Through Him indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was accomplished
To God, Christ is the Son of God's love, the image of the invisible God, and the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells
In the past we may have realized that Christ is our life, but did we realize that the Christ who is our life is such a Christ?
In this book these things do not refer to bad things but to many good things, such as philosophy, human knowledge, and human wisdom
The teachings of Confucius may appear to be good but actually they are enemies of Christ capturing people and carrying them away from Christ
He is the image of the invisible God, the center of the whole universe, the Head over all things, and a real person to be our life
We are not here just to learn His teachings; we are here to learn how to live in Him, with Him, by Him, and through Him
He writes, 'Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath'
After listing all these positive items, the apostle goes on to say, 'Which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ'
The custom was that everyone would rise up early in the morning , put on new clothing, and begin to do many things to celebrate the New Year
By telling us that Christ can be all these things to us, the apostle Paul gave us a practical way to experience Christ as our life
Christ is the reality, and by taking Him as the reality of all these things, we can have the practical experience of Christ as our life
As the Son of God's love, the image of the invisible God, and the One in whom God's fullness dwells, Christ is everything to God
Finally, as the Firstborn of resurrection and the Head of the Body, Christ is everything to the new creation, the church
As we receive more spiritual understanding, we should also pray that the Lord would give us the spiritual language, the spiritual utterance
We will not only love the things of God but will be able also to utter them and even give a message concerning them
According to Colossians 1913 first we receive the knowledge of Gods plan and then based on that knowledge we walk worthily of the Lord
When this happens, we will have wisdom in our spirit and heart and spiritual understanding in our spiritually enlightened and renewed mind
When we brothers sat down to eat, everyone saw that the wife had not cooked anything new but had put out leftovers from the day before
The little girl spoke to her for some time, and then suddenly the young daughter stood up onto the bench upon which they had been sitting
As soon as she stood up, the whole meeting just burst; the whole meeting was immediately filled with praises and hallelujahs
After these three experiences-knowing, walking, and being strengthened-we should add a fourth-giving thanks to the Father
We should sing hymns, offer praise, and give thanks to the Father for qualifying us for a share of the portion of the saints
The more we have the revelation of God's plan and the more we experience Christ, the more we will feel that we are in the light
When the sun is shining and the lights in the room are turned on, however, we are all kept in a state of order
The more we experience Christ, the more we have light, because light is nothing other than the life of Christ that we experience
Love is the substance, essence, and element of life; life is the energy and strength of love; and light is the shining forth of love
When the life within us is lived out of us, it is lived out of us as love, and when this life is lived out of us as love, it shines
We have been delivered out of this kingdom and translated, transferred, into the kingdom of the Son of God's love
We have received Christ as our life, but we must realize that this life, Christ Himself, is a sphere, a kingdom, for us to walk in
In the same way, everything related to good and evil are foreign to a man who is living in the kingdom of Christ
We are citizens of the kingdom of Christ, so we do not understand good or bad; we know only one thing-Christ as our life
These two verses contain four very important expressions-received the Christ, walk in Him, having been rooted, and being built up
As a result, they were not walking in Christ-they were not 'living in their own country' but had been brought into 'foreign kingdoms'
We also had a good amount of fellowship concerning what terms, utterances, words, or phrases we were going to use in the messages
In this fellowship Brother Nee would often say, 'Brother, that word is not the right word for the kingdom of God'
Using words that are appropriate for the kingdom of God is just one small example of what it means to walk in Christ
As citizens of the kingdom of God, which kingdom is simply Christ Himself, we must live a life that is suitable to Christ
Colossians 2:6 tells us that we have received Christ and that we should walk in Him; verse 7 reveals that we also have been rooted in Him
The fact that we have been rooted in Christ reveals that we have a very particular kind of unity and identification with Him
We all need to see that we are like little plants that have been rooted in Christ so that by His nourishing and supplying we will grow up
All these items mentioned in Colossians-receiving Christ, walking in Christ, and being rooted in Christ-reveal Christ to us
After telling us that we have received Christ, we might expect that the following phrase would tell us to keep Him
One such verse is 1 Corinthians 3:9, which says, 'For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's cultivated land, God's building'
As God's cultivated land, we must be rooted in Christ as our soil in order to grow; as God's building, we must be built up
What then is the relationship between growth and building, and how can being rooted and being built up be merged into one?
From the verses we have just considered, we can see that growth is for building and that building is the result of growth
The building of the church is not the result of some kind of work; it is the result of the growth of the life of Christ in all of us
If there is no growth of the life of Christ among us, there is no possibility that the church will be built up among us
After some time passes, however, it is manifested that they have not truly been built together, because they all are still primarily clay
When a little water falls on the pieces of clay that you have glued together, the clay will dissolve, and your building work will be gone
If a person breaks one of his bones, as long as the two bones are held together, after a month or so they will grow back together
As those who have received Christ, we must learn to take Christ as our life and allow the life of Christ to increase within us day by day
Before such a brother can be built with others, he must grow up more in Christ; he must have his mind transformed into the image of Christ
When the two sons of Aaron died before the presence of the Lord, the Lord told Moses to tell Aaron not to weep
Do you think that if Paul were to come to you while he was undergoing severe suffering that he would come to you with tears?
One day, his other sons returned from Egypt with proof that Joseph was alive and had become the highest ranking person in all of Egypt
In order for you to be built up with the other brothers and sisters, Christ must gain the ground in and occupy your emotion
You must allow the Lord to grow in and transform your emotion so that your emotion will no longer be natural but spiritual
Loving the Lord causes us to know the Lord, and when we truly know the Lord, we will no longer be so easily moved or hurt in our emotions
It will not matter how the brothers and sisters treat us; regardless of how they treat us, we will remain the same
Since the church is built up by the growth of the believers, we must consider another matter related to our growth
Any message, book, or literature that speaks of the building of the church must stress the experience of Christ as life
God desires that Christ would come into our spirit as the Spirit to mingle together with us and to be our element
All visible physical things are not real; they are simply figures and shadows of the reality, which is Christ Himself
But we should also check to see whether we are acting by ourselves or whether it is Christ who is living in us
In other words, when we are doing all the things that we do in our daily life, do we truly apply Christ in what we are doing?
Day by day, moment by moment, and in whatever we are doing, we will check to see whether or not what we are doing is Christ living within us
He says that we are dead , that we have been buried , that we have to put off the old man , and that we have been circumcised
As vessels made for the purpose of containing Christ we must be emptied of everything that is not Christ before we can be filled with Christ
If we are no longer living, then it will be very easy for Christ to fill us with Himself and become everything to us
Only real sufferings can bring us to an end, for the more we suffer, the more we will realize that we are nothing and Christ is everything
Conversely, it seems that often when there is a brother who loves the Lord and seeks after Him, his wife is very much against Him
God is sovereign over all our circumstances and is arranging all our situations for one thing-to bring us through pressure and burning
The only way for us to be saved is for God to put us into situations that will press us, burn us, and bring us to an end
We may need not only one wife but also several children to be the pressure and the burning power to bring us to an end
On the one hand, to experience Christ is to enjoy something, but on the other hand, to experience Christ is to suffer something
The more we suffer, the more we will realize that we are nothing, and the more we suffer, the more we will realize that Christ is everything
In light of this we can see why Paul uses in Colossians 1:11 the expression unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy
After all these years of suffering, he will be brought to the point where it will be very easy for him to apply Christ to his daily living
Whenever they contact him, they will sense that he is a man who is living Christ, walking with Christ, and lost in Christ
At this point in this brother's experience it will also be very easy for him to be builded together and joined with the other saints
We all need to pray that the Lord would give us more revelation of His desire and direct our hearts into this way
Christ is God the Creator, the Firstborn of creation, the means of creation, and the center and Head of all that has been created
He is also the Firstborn from the dead, the Head of the church, and the One whom God intended would have the first place in all things
As the mystery of God, Christ is not only our life and everything, He is also the reality of every positive thing in the universe
If we do not have Christ, we are surely hungry and without food, because Christ is the real food for our whole being
In His eternal plan, God has made Christ to be our real food, our real life, and the reality of all positive things in the universe
We must realize that Christ is everything, and that Christ also fills everything-He is the 'the One who fills all in all'
Every morning when we put on our clothes, do we have the sense that Christ is our real covering and our real clothing ?
When we are preparing to lie down on our bed, do we have the realization that Christ is our true rest, our real bed ?
When we are walking upstairs, do we realize that Christ is our real stairs and that apart from Him we can neither go up nor down ?
Rather, we are coming to the living Word of God to gain the deep sense that Christ is everything and to be brought into this experience
Although very few of the Lord's children realize this, God's intention is that Christ would be everything to us
Ephesians 3:17a speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts: 'That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith'
Finally, chapter four, verse 13 says that we will eventually arrive 'at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ'
The reason that a glove is created according to a hand with four fingers and a thumb is so that a hand can fit into the glove
Although we were created according to Christ, many of us may have a mind, emotion, and will that are absolutely without Christ
When the Lord was on the earth, sometimes He became angry, and as those created according to Christ, anger is one of our emotions
God desires that we would be filled with Christ not only in our spirit but also in our mind, emotion, will, and heart
Verses 9 through 11 continue, 'But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you
These two verses contain three key phrases: the Lord is the Spirit, the Spirit of the Lord, and the Lord Spirit
The important thing to see in all of the above verses is that Christ today is the Spirit, and as the Spirit, He lives within us
He said that many times we pray to the Lord in the same way that a sick person asks his doctor for a dose of medicine
If you put something bitter into a baby's mouth, although he has never heard of the word bitter, he will immediately spit it out
You have such a sense because you have Christ within you, and because you have Christ within you, you have such a sense
Sometimes after we have been speaking with a brother or sister for a while, we have the sense that we have spoken enough
The sense of life within us is Christ Himself, and by going along with the sense of life, we apply Christ to our living
We must realize that we are no longer the ones who are living, but that it is Christ who is now living within us
If we go along with this sense, applying the death of the cross to our self and old man, then we will experience and apply Christ
As a result, when we go to have some fellowship with a certain brother or sister, we may not remember any of this
Just as it requires practice to learn to drive a car, it also takes practice to learn to apply Christ in the way we have discussed above
When we are about to have some fellowship with one of the brothers or sisters, we have to practice all these things
Christ will have the ground and will take the opportunity to occupy our mind, emotion, will, mouth, and language
We need to spend much time in the presence of the Lord to pray in a particular way concerning this very matter
The Bible does not record very many of the prayers of the apostles, but it does record some of the prayers of the apostle Paul
Paul prayed very much that we might have the opening of our eyes, the revelation, concerning God's eternal plan
We must ask the Lord for revelation; otherwise, we will never be able to experience Christ as our life to the fullest extent
When this knowledge of revelation is impressed into our spirit, heart, mind, and entire being, it will become a controlling factor within us
The first and central aspect of this revelation is that God's eternal plan is that Christ would enter into us to be our life
The Lord is the Spirit, we have a spirit, and we can receive the Lord Spirit into our spirit and be mingled together with Him
Merely to receive some teaching or to hear about something will not cause us to have the reality of what we have been taught or have heard
If you cannot see the germs, you may feel that the item is quite clean, and what they have told you will not mean anything to you
Only when we see this, will we be able to realize and experience to the full the fact that Christ is life to us
After seeing that Christ is our life, the second aspect of the revelation that we must see is that we are dead, buried, and finished
We died with Christ on the cross on the day that Christ died, and we were buried on the day that we were baptized
Most of us know the doctrine that we were buried in our baptism, but we need not only the truth of this matter but the revelation
Before you receive such a revelation, you may read the Scriptures, pray, come to the meetings, and try to do good and overcome evil
When faced with evil, you will try your best to overcome, and when faced with the opportunity to do good, you will try your best to do it
You will not try to overcome it because you will have the deep realization that you have been buried and are through with this world
When you have the opportunity to do good, since you realize that you have been buried, you simply will not try to do it
It is not wrong to say all these things, but to answer in such a way indicates that you have not realized that you have been buried
If you were to go to a cemetery and speak to the people who have been buried there, would you receive an answer?
The same principle applies if one of your schoolmates suggests to you that you do something good to help others
To tell you the truth, neither a brother with a bad temper nor a brother with a good temper can be built up with others
She answered, 'I received the light that husbands must love their wives in the same way that Christ loves the church
He replied that he also had read Ephesians 5 and had received the wonderful light that wives must subject themselves to their husbands
If you have such an attitude when you come to the Word, the Word will be open to you and you will receive revelation in your spirit
You will experience Christ more and more in your daily life and will avoid the temptation to do good and to overcome evil
If you do not know Christ, you do not know the mystery of God, and if you are not in Christ, you are not in the mystery of God
If you would like to meet Christ, know Christ, and receive something of Christ, you must contact the Body of Christ, the church
People today are busy with education and politics, but if you were to ask them what they are living for, they might be shocked
In China we have a little proverb that says that human life is nothing but three times of satisfaction and one time of sleeping every day
You do not know what you are, where you are, where you are going, or what the meaning of the universe or human life is
As each of the living things created by God were brought before Adam, he looked at them and gave each one a proper name
If Christ is meekness within you, you will be very meek, but you will have no consciousness that you are being meek
If you were to hear others saying of you, 'This person is so meek,' you would think that they were speaking of someone else
In the same way, when Christ is love to you and you love others through this love, you will not feel that you are a person who loves others
The church life is not a life of goodness, meekness, gentleness, or love; the church life is a life of living out Christ
The only way for us to have the real church life is for us to be transformed from the natural man into the new man, the spiritual man
When we reject ourselves and know the grace of God, Christ will have the full ground and opportunity within us as the Holy Spirit
If we try to solve problems by discussing them, once one problem is settled, ten more will be caused by the way it is settled
We all must give Christ the free way, so that He can attain what He has been seeking for generations and generations
Today people pay attention to many so-called spiritual works, but most of them neglect the heart's desire of God
King David was called a man after God's heart because he was always seeking to obtain a dwelling place for God
David not only prepared a tabernacle, a tent, for the ark of God, he also intended to build a temple, a house, for the ark
Although David did not do the building work directly, he prepared nearly all the materials for the building of the house of God
Since God's desire is the Body of Christ, all the work of Christ and all the work of the Spirit are for the Body of Christ
Of the thousands and thousands of people included in the two-the Jewish and Gentile people-the Lord created in Himself just one new man
The creation of this new man is the reason that the Lord Jesus died, resurrected, ascended, and came down as the Holy Spirit
We can realize from these verses that we are baptized in and are given to drink of the one Spirit in order to realize the Body life
Your growth, my growth, and the growth of every believer in the spiritual life is for the building up of the Body of Christ
All the functions, ministries, and gifts of all the members of the Body are also for the building up of the Body
All gifts including the gift of teaching the gift of speaking in tongues and even a little gift of love are for the building up of the Body
According to Romans 12, even the love that we show to other members of the Body is a gift that is for the building up of the Body of Christ
The gifted members-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers-are given to the Body for the building up of the Body
All growth in life and every gift, ministry, and function of every member of the Body are for the building up of the Body
All of these answers are correct, but we must also realize that regeneration has made us members of the Body of Christ
You also realize that you are still so individual and independent of all the other members, so you dare not say yes either
One of the leading brothers may say in response to this, 'I meet with the brothers and other believers every day'
They are both already in Christ, but one is in Christ with a Chinese mind, and the other is in Christ with an American mind
To be related to others, we all have to be normal brothers and sisters-normal to the extent that there is nothing special about us
The Spirit must overrule and govern the mind emotion and will that is our mind emotion and will must be under the control of the Spirit
We have to drink of the Holy Spirit day by day so that He will saturate our whole being, and in so doing, He will transform our whole being
In order to realize the real life of the Body, we have to be baptized by the Holy Spirit and to drink of this one Spirit
