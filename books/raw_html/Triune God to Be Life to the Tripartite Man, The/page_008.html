<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Putting Man before the Tree of Life Indicating that God Desires<br>that Man Would Take Him,<br>Signified by the Tree of Life, as Man's Life</H2><P>The tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9) is a symbol of God as life. God is Spirit (John 4:24); as such, He is abstract, difficult for people to grasp, understand, or touch. In His wisdom God used the tree of life as a symbol of Himself. The tree of life is a particular tree. All the other different kinds of trees, such as the apple tree, the peach tree, and the banana tree, are easily understood by everyone. But not many people understand what the tree of life is. Life is mysterious and abstract. The tree of life symbolizes God as life. Therefore, when we take the tree of life, we take God into us as our life. Although this seems very simple, the tree of life is not easy to understand.</P><P>On a radio program some years ago in Los Angeles, a famous preacher and Bible teacher was asked what the tree of life is. He replied that, since the tree of life no longer existed, there was no further need for us to know about it. His answer indicated that he was short of the proper biblical knowledge. The tree of life is mentioned not only in Genesis 2 but also in Revelation 2 and 22. Revelation 2:7 says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God." How could the Lord give us to eat of something that no longer exists? In Revelation 22:2 the Bible concludes emphatically with the matter of the tree of life. The tree of life continues to exist, but few understand the meaning of the tree of life. Life is inexplicable, and God also is inexplicable. The tree of life in Genesis 2:9 symbolizes God. Therefore, the tree of life can also be called "the tree of God."</P><P>According to the description in Revelation 22:2, the tree of life apparently is a vine. This verse says that the tree of life grows on the two sides of the river. Hence, it grows along the river on both of its banks. A pine tree, which grows upward, can never occupy two banks of a river; but a vine can. In John 15 the Lord Jesus said that He was the true vine (v. 1). The other vines are symbols, but the Lord Jesus is the real vine. If we put Genesis 2, John 15, and Revelation 22 together, we can see that God is the tree of life and that the tree of life is a vine. As a vine God can reach people wherever they are.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Prohibiting the Fallen Man,<br>by the Cherubim and the Flaming Sword,<br>from Taking the Tree of Life Indicating that<br>God's Glory, Holiness, and Righteousness<br>Do Not Allow the Sinful Man<br>to Abuse the Life of God</H2><P>Satan's tempting of man to take the tree of knowledge indicates that Satan wants to keep man from taking God as his life (Gen. 3:1-6). After man took of the tree of knowledge, God placed cherubim and a flaming sword (Gen. 3:24) before the tree of life in order to prevent man from taking of the tree of life also. God's prohibiting of fallen man by the cherubim and the flaming sword from taking the tree of life indicates that God's glory (signified by the cherubim), holiness (signified by the flame), and righteousness (signified by the sword) do not allow the sinful man to abuse the life of God. The sword signifies God's righteousness. In Revelation 19 the Lord is the One who judges in righteousness (v. 11) with the sharp sword that proceeds out of His mouth (v. 15). The Lord judges by the sword, and the sword is related to His righteousness. God's glory, holiness, and righteousness keep man away from taking God as his life. Fallen man has lost his position to enter into God to take God as his life.</P>
