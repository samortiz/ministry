   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These verses are crucial to our understanding of the definition of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. LIFE IS NOT DEVOTION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first point we need to see is that life is not devotion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many Christians consider devotion to be the spiritual life, but devotion is our exercise of piety.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is an exercise on our side by our own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul said in Galatians 2:20a, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that life is Christ living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to help the saints to realize that we should never consider devotion as life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One may be very devotional and yet not have much life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some nuns and priests in the Catholic Church may be very devotional, but that is merely their kind of pious exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Life is not any kind of activity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Life is altogether Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must stress this to the uttermost, helping the saints to know that life is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nothing can replace life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>LIFE IS NOT GOOD BEHAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Generally speaking, Christians consider that if a person's behavior is good, he has life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I was in China, I observed that a number of the disciples of Confucius behaved better than the Christian missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were so gentle, patient, and humble.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were also very meek, having the virtue of giving in to others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But this is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is merely good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Confucius said that we need to develop the "bright virtue" within us, which is actually the development of our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But we need to stress that life is not good behavior springing from our own effort to develop our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man was created good, but man was corrupted and damaged by the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Still there is something good within man which was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The teachings of Confucius are to help develop man's good nature, the natural, good virtues created by God within man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These virtues have been damaged but are still left in man's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The good behavior developed by man is according to his doing, but life is Christ lived out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Life is not our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul said in Philippians 1:21a, "For to me, to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, life is not good behavior; it is Christ lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Christ lives within us, and then Christ lives Himself out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to train the saints to discern the difference between good behavior and life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may admire a certain brother because he is gentle, meek, humble, and patient.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may think that he is full of life, but this means that we do not have the proper discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This brother whom we admire may be expressing his natural virtues in his good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Life, however, is Christ expressed from within us and lived out from within us.</S>
