A few were written by him, and one was written by Ruth Lee. Originally, it was called Hymns for the Little Flock. Later, this name was dropped because people used it to designate us as the Church of the Little Flock. The contents were classified as follows: words of praise, joy of salvation, springs of the valley of Baca, union with Christ, growth in grace, seeking in the spiritual pathway, consolation of the pilgrims, prayer meeting, consecration, spiritual warfare, the Holy Spirit, the work, general hymns, the praise of the sucklings, and the trumpet of the gospel.</P><P>2)Hymns: A larger collection of 1,052 hymns compiled and composed by Watchman Nee with the cooperation of some brothers.</P><P>3)Gospel Songs: A collection of one hundred songs and hymns compiled and composed by Witness Lee.</P>
