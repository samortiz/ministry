   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEAKING AND DRIFTING Issue No. 14 Scripture Reading: Heb 2:1-4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Hebrews contains various passages of warnings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every time there is a word of warning in Hebrews, we can find an important teaching immediately preceding or following the warning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>An important teaching may appear first, and then a word of warning follows.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Or an important teaching may be preceded by a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the structure of the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this book, there are five or six warnings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The passage we read in Hebrews 2 comprises the first warning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This warning is placed in between chapters one and two.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What does chapter one cover?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter one is on glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does chapter two cover?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter two is on shame.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Chapter one is on God and chapter two is on man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter one is on glory and chapter two is on suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chapter one tells us who Christ is from eternity past to eternity future, while chapter two tells us what He has accomplished in time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Chapter one is on His person, while chapter two is on His work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In between these two chapters, we have a word of warning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is this warning about?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a warning for us to give heed concerning the person of Christ and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What kind of attitude should we have when speaking of the person of Christ and His work?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First we must be clear concerning the teaching and the background of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before we study the first warning in Hebrews, we must briefly mention the ones to whom this book was addressed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We know that the book of Hebrews was written to the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A group of Jews were saved; they understood the things concerning the Old Testament, the temple, and the worship in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the same time, they also knew about the New Testament and the worship in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They had known Christ and believed in Him, received Him, and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now they had both of the above things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were Christians and not outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This letter was not written to the Gentiles, nor to those who had never known salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This letter was written to those who knew salvation already.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They were not unbelievers, but Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word Hebrews is very meaningful; it means river crossers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first Hebrew was Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Abraham lived first on the east side of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later he moved to the west side.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because he crossed the Euphrates River to the west side, he became a Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hebrews means the river crossers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The book of Hebrews was written to the river crossers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was written to those who had given up something behind them and were pursuing toward something before them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They left the former world behind, and following God's word, they journeyed on to a new place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God wrote through the apostle to the Hebrews who had forsaken the world and who were standing in a new realm.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were like us who have believed in the Lord Jesus, who have denied the former world, and who are standing today on a new ground and in a new sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This letter was written to this group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is very interesting that such a warning was given to this group of people: "Therefore we ought to give heed more abundantly to the things which have been heard lest perhaps we drift away."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the first warning; it was given to the Hebrews, the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Behind them was one world, and before them was another kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God issued a warning to this group of people through the mouth of the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This warning also tells us what the present danger is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The danger is to drift away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today we will study this warning in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It says that we should give heed, and that if we do not give heed, there is the danger of drifting away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This warning is needed because there is the danger ahead, the possibility, of drifting along with the current.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The result of drifting along with the current is to miss so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why do we have to give heed?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is because this great salvation has been accomplished by God already, and we have to give heed lest we lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to give heed because there is the possibility of missing this great salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Who is behind this great salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is God, the Lord, and the Holy Spirit; They have distributed it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Let us now consider Hebrews 2:1.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We cannot study all four verses.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can study only the first verse, using the other three verses as supplements.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 1 says, "Therefore,..."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that this verse is a continuation of what was spoken of before.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because the Lord Jesus, as spoken of in chapter one, is so lofty, glorious, and excellent, because He is such a God, full of glory, and above all men and even the angels, we have to give heed to the things that we have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because the things that we have heard convey such a Jesus to us, we have to give heed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Bible is a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Gospel of John is different from all the other Gospels, and the things it records are different from those that are recorded in the other Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When one reads Matthew, Mark, and Luke, he can place them side by side.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But one cannot put the Gospel of John alongside the other Gospels; it has to be placed in a different category.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It does not record the birth of Jesus by Mary, because it starts from the beginning, from eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everything it says has to do with things that are in glory, at the beginning, far above all, and before the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our gospel today does not merely tell men, either sinners or believers, about a fisherman who walked by the Sea of Galilee nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Nor do we want to show men merely a carpenter from Nazareth who lived nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Neither are we presenting to men a Jesus who is merely human, a son of man born of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Rather, we are presenting One whom God calls His companion.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We want men to know the Lord Jesus as the One who was there from eternity past and who is in the glory now.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have to speak about His relationship with us, and about the things we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is not a bastard.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Jews thought that He was just a bastard born in the land of Judea nineteen hundred thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But this is not what we preach.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We begin from eternity past; He was there in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is why we have to give heed to the things which we have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Friends, we have to give heed today.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But to what do we have to give heed?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have to give heed to the things which have been heard.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What have we heard?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have heard the things concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>How much have we heard?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I believe those who are sitting here have heard a great deal about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have heard so much.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>What should we do now?</S>
