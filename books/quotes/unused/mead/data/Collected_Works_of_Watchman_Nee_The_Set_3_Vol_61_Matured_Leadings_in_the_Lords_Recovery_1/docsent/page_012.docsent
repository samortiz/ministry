   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPIRITUAL FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the second point, that is, spiritual fire, I would like to say this: Fire relates to supply.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Individually, it depends on our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Corporately, it depends on fellowship, or the supply in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there is no problem with our personal consecration, it may be God's leading that we should seek His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Corporately speaking, the matter of fire relates to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without fellowship there is no fire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are in fellowship, we touch the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not a matter of gift, but of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Where there is ministry, there is fire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ministry is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is more in ministry than in individual pursuits, but we will cover this later.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, consider the individual aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Individually, we only need to check our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If there is a problem with our consecration, there is a problem with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There must be an absolute consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Otherwise, there is no fire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fire is from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord casts this fire on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This fire is also the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It enables us to serve, to withstand persecution, and even to sacrifice our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the personal side, fire depends absolutely on our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The amount of consecration we offer on the altar determines the intensity of the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If consecration is lacking, the fire will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we cannot hold back anything in our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Consecration, in turn, comes from light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We consecrate to God according to the light we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can only consecrate according to what we have received, according to what our spiritual eyes can see.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The light we see comes from our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through constant fellowship, God shines on us and grants us revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we are under His shining, we see His demand and consecrate ourselves to Him voluntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then God sends down His fire to take up our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, fire comes from God and is communicated to us through consecration; we do not light the fire ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the fire on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once the sacrifice is on the altar, the fire comes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consecration is not a one-time act, but a continual act.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the beginning we do not know what we should consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Gradually, we receive more light, and we consecrate more, and our consecration becomes more absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The stronger our consecration is, the greater is the fire on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consecration follows shining.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The amount of shining we receive determines the degree of consecration we render.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our consecration must match the light that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Individually, when we put everything on the altar, the fire comes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Between the light and the fire, there is the need of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If consecration follows the light, immediately there is fire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The stronger the consecration, the easier it is for the fire to start.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once the fire starts, others will catch it easily.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If our next-door neighbor's house is on fire, it is easy for ours to catch fire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This fire will turn even hard wood into hot flames.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a person tries to fan a spark before it develops into a flame, the fire will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, the more rubbing and friction there is, the easier it is to catch a fire.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the reason we have to rub each other until we are red-hot.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The hotter we become, the more fire there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are cold, fanning will only quench the fire; it will not build the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No one should seek for fire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as we have enough consecration and as long as we have enough friction, we will have the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the spiritual pathway is too easy and relaxed, the fire of the gospel will be extinguished.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more we go on in the spiritual pathway, the more we should not consider ourselves as experienced or matured.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we think that we have consecrated enough, we will quench the fire on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the Old Testament God commanded that the fire on the altar must not go out day or night Lev 6:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The entire life of a Christian, from the time he first believes to the time he goes to the Lord, must be accompanied by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Mark 8:35 the Lord said, "Whoever will lose his soul-life for My sake and the gospel's...."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is not only for the Lord's sake but also for the gospel's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul was an apostle who was consecrated for the gospel's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He said, "And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it" 1 Cor 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The more he advanced in his spiritual life and the deeper his life took root, the more the fire of the gospel burned in him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul said that he was a called apostle separated unto the gospel of God Rom 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The gospel not only includes saving sinners from hell, but every aspect of God's gospel, including salvation, sanctification, justification, the church, etc. The gospel covers a wide scope.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Paul said that he was the foremost among sinners, yet he was called to be a pattern to other believers 1 Tim 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He also said that he was less than the least of all saints, yet he received grace to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These verses show us that the Lord has called us for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have to shout aloud that we need to bring in a gospel spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the only way for the brothers and sisters to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Unless we have this spirit, our preaching will be like children playing with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In Foochow the fire of the gospel has been ignited.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The church not only must preach the gospel but must touch the gospel spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In order to touch the gospel spirit, the only way is for us to have a fresh consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The author of the book Seen and Heard, Mr. M'Kendrick, was a miner.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He did not even attend an elementary school, but he was a totally consecrated person.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Within him was the gospel fire.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>His heart was filled with a burning zeal for saving souls.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Once, while he was on the platform, he could not utter a word.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As he looked around at the unsaved people sitting before him, he began to cry, and tears rolled down his cheeks like torrents.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In the end he only shouted a word or two.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God's Spirit filled the entire congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>All were convicted of their sin and waywardness.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should not be afraid of shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>John the Baptist shouted in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Lord Jesus also shouted.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The apostles shouted many times in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Although Brother M'Kendrick did not have much education or gift, he had the gospel spirit, and countless numbers of people were saved through him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A young person may not have the gift of Moody, Finney, or Spurgeon, but he can learn to be a M'Kendrick.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A young brother may not necessarily have the gift of the gospel, but he must have the spirit of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In church history God raises up great evangelists only once in a long while.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But every lover of the Lord should and must have a gospel spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>On the one hand, we should increase our gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>On the other hand, we should increase our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Our consecration cannot stop.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Once we stop our consecration, the spirit of the gospel will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In order to recover the gospel, we have to recover consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Both things have to be absolute in us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Our foolishness lies in the misconception that we are behind the early church only in the power of the gospel; actually, our consecration comes far behind the early disciples as well.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>May the fire of God's gospel continue to burn in us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>May it ignite you and me first.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>May the church not become a hindrance to the world's salvation, but a channel through which the Lord is dispensed to the world.</S>
