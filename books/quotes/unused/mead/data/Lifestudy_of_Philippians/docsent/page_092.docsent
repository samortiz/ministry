   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL S GRACE AND OURS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider the meaning of the words my grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we consider this expression in the context of the entire book of Philippians, we shall see that the grace which was Paul s grace was nothing less than the Triune God whom Paul enjoyed and experienced and of whom Paul was a partaker.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, Paul s grace was not God in an objective way; it was God subjectively and experientially, the Triune God processed to be his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul truly enjoyed and experienced the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was rich in his experience of the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This processed Triune God was Paul s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are familiar with the hymn Amazing Grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although this is a good hymn, it does not speak of the Triune God as our portion for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When this hymn was written, the experiential knowledge of God among the Lord s people had not come to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even as recent as fifty years ago, Christians did not have the understanding of grace as the Triune God experienced and enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before us, we have come to know that grace is far more than merely unmerited favor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Grace is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit processed for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today our Triune God is no longer the unprocessed God, or the raw God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, He has been processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those with a background in systematic theology may be troubled by the expressions processed God and raw God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They may argue that in the Bible we cannot find such terms.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although these terms are not used, the facts are there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In like manner, we cannot find the terms Trinity and Triune God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, there is no doubt that the Bible reveals the fact that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, we cannot deny that the incarnation was a process.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, the crucifixion, which led to resurrection, and the resurrection, which led to ascension, were also steps in God s process.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has passed through a process not only to redeem us, but also to make it possible for us to enjoy Him as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the One we enjoy as our grace is the Triune God who has passed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As such a One, He is ready for us to take and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John 1:17 says that the law was given through Moses, but grace came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When this grace becomes ours in our experience, we then enjoy the Triune God, and we can speak of my grace, our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our grace is the very Triune God enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Recently my wife and I were praying, thanking the Lord for all the enjoyment of Himself that He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How good the Lord has been to us!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can testify that we have experienced Him and enjoyed Him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because we have partaken of Him, He has truly become grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This grace is now our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In your experience do you not also have your grace?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps you have experienced the Triune God as your grace in the church life and in your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A brother may testify that even in helping to arrange the chairs in the meeting hall he experiences God as his grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Also, a married sister may testify that in her life at home with her husband and children she experiences the Lord as her grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is very good to experience the Lord in this way and testify of it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But these situations can hardly be compared to what Paul faced in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE DEFENSE AND CONFIRMATION OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul experienced God both in his imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 1:7 Paul speaks of the defense and confirmation of the gospel ; he does not here mention the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To preach the gospel is not unusual, but to defend the gospel and confirm it are extraordinary things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul defended the gospel, on the negative side, from perverting and distorting heresies, such as Judaism, dealt with in Galatians, and Gnosticism, dealt with in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul confirmed the gospel, on the positive side, with all the revelations of God s mysteries concerning Christ and the church as unveiled in Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>During Paul s time, the gospel had been perverted and distorted by Judaism and Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because he defended the gospel, he was persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Neither the Judaizers nor the Greek philosophers were happy with him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In addition, Paul confirmed the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He made the goal of the gospel clear to people in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The goal of the gospel is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul preached message after message telling people about God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He taught that Christ is the mystery of God and that the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this way, he confirmed the gospel by making the positive goal of the gospel clear to all who received it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today there is also the urgent need for the defense and confirmation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Not many Christians are willing to speak concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result, even though they may preach the gospel, many do not know the goal of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Their goal in preaching the gospel is simply to save sinners, to win souls.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, there is the need for us to confirm the gospel by telling others of the goal of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do this, however, we shall meet opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Both the defense of the gospel and the confirmation of the gospel are difficult tasks and heavy burdens.</S>
