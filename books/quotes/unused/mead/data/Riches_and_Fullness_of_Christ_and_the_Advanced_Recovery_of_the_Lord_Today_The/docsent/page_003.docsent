   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HIS PERSON, NATURE, EXPERIENCE, WORK, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, AND ATTAINMENTS ALL BEING EXCELLENT BEYOND COMPARISON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all know that the person denotes the being of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our person is very insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only the person of the Lord Jesus is excellent beyond comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, He is God: the Lord Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Outside of Him, we cannot find God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition, He is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is unlimited in what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is power, He is authority, He is light, and He is love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the positive things in the universe are types of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Greatness, authority, honor, glory, and nobility are all expressions of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Human language can never describe in full the wonder of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, He is also man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus is not only God; He is also man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This makes His person complete.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the incarnation of the Lord Jesus, God was merely God; He was not a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But today, this God has become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The One whom the prophets in the Old Testament worshipped was only God; He was not a man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the birth of the Lord Jesus was God taking up humanity to become a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During the last three and a half years, when the Lord Jesus was fulfilling His ministry in preaching the gospel, those following Him always asked the question: "Who is this One?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Is He God, or is He man?''</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our natural concept, there is a clear distinction between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But here is One who is God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is man, yet in Him is God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Him, God and man are mingled together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, He is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mark 4 records one time that the Lord Jesus crossed the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suddenly, a great storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the Lord Jesus was asleep in the stern on a cushion vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>35-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that God does not slumber; neither does He need to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Lord Jesus slept peacefully in the stern of the boat, where the tossing was the most severe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The waves rolled in, one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the disciples were frightened.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They awoke the Lord and said to Him, "Teacher, doesn't it matter to You that we are perishing?'' v. 38 . When the Lord rose up, He rebuked the winds and the waves, and there was a great calm.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, He rebuked the disciples for their fear and lack of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The disciples feared greatly and wondered whether the wonderful One before their eyes was God or man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day, the Lord told Nicodemus that He was the One who descended out of heaven and who is in heaven John 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was not in heaven first, then on earth; rather, He is in heaven and on earth simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is also the One we believe in, the One who is now our life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today, not only is He in heaven and on earth, but He is even in you, in me, and in everyone here who has believed into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ephesians 4:6 tells us that He is above all, through all, and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Like the air around us, He can be everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These are His all-inclusive, unlimited, excellent, and unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's nature is also rich beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Holiness and righteousness are God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we believe into God, we have holiness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more you say that there is no God, the less holiness and righteousness you have.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can never explain this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is the same with the air.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not know all about the air, yet daily we are breathing it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we stop breathing for five minutes, I am afraid that we will be through.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Air is very important to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For our daily life we also need food and water.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But to get these two things, we have to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, there is no price for breathing the air.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Air does not need to go through any special process, and we can enjoy it without exerting any conscious effort.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, among these three things, the most important one is the air; we cannot live without it for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The thing that is most necessary is also the thing that is most available.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the way the Lord Jesus is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is the One that we need the most, and yet He is also the One most available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is so available because He is limitless.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We can enjoy His riches because He is everything to us.</S>
