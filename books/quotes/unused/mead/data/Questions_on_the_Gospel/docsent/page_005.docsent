   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6 Grace does not directly forgive man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This question has been misunderstood by many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They consider that God forgives sinners' sins because He is generous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This concept is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible does not say that God forgives sinners because He is tolerant, plays deaf, or is careless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 5:21 says, "In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sin reigns by itself, but grace reigns through righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Grace does not reign by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must know that God has not only grace but also righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God delights not only in saving man but also in safeguarding man's salvation with righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For God to give us grace does not mean that God is generous to forgive our sins in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, God devised and worked out a solution to the problem of our sins, affording us the opportunity to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we misunderstand God's grace and consider it merely as God's generosity, the cross of Christ would be unnecessary and totally meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Certainly without the love of God, there is no cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if there is only God's love without God's righteousness, there would still be no cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God knows that we have sinned, and He cannot overlook our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since we have no way to settle this sin, He caused His Son to bear our sins on the cross and solved the problem of sin once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's grace solves the problem of sin and then forgives our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why the Lord had to die before we could even possibly be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A sinner is reckoned as a sinner because: 1 his conduct is bad; 2 his nature is corrupted; and 3 God's righteous law has judged him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In saving a sinner God must: 1 forgive his sins, that is, his bad conduct; 2 regenerate him by giving him a new life; and 3 justify him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus has received the punishment of sins and died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God will forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some think that we have to beg God until He changes His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can obtain forgiveness because God has poured out His wrath and laid our sins upon the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we can say, "Thank and praise God that the Lord Jesus has been judged."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Righteousness requires a punishment only once; there will be no more punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>7 Grace does not directly forgive a believer's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This principle is the same as the one above.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose a Christian, after being saved, is incidentally overcome by transgressions and repents.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He does not need to beg God in order for God to forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not have to ask God to do something today, but believe in what Christ has already done.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since the Lord Jesus has died, God will forgive those who have received salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a Christian, unfortunately, commits sins, he must be clear about four things: 1 by confessing his sins, he will obtain forgiveness 1 John 1:9 ; 2 any kind of sin can be forgiven vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>7, 9; "cleanses us from every sin" and "cleanse us from all unrighteousness" means all ; 3 before he confesses his sins, God is willing to forgive him because the Lord Jesus is his Advocate before God 2:1-2 ; and 4 God forgives and cleanses him because, on the one hand, God is faithful and righteous and, on the other hand, the Lord Jesus is the Righteous One.</S>
