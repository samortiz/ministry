These illustrations also unveil the fact that the believers are righteousness, light, Christ, and the temple of God, and the unbelievers are lawlessness, darkness, Belial (Satan the Devil), and idols.</p><p>In verse 14 Paul says, &ldquo;What partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?&rdquo; There should not be any sort of contact between righteousness and lawlessness. There should be no relationship, no partnership, between them. Likewise, light and darkness have nothing to do with each other. They cannot have any fellowship. As believers, we are in the light. If we have fellowship, or intimate friendship, with unbelievers, that kind of friendship is fellowship between light and darkness. For a believer to marry an unbeliever is for that believer to have fellowship of light with darkness.</p><p>In verse 15 Paul continues, &ldquo;And what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what part has a believer with an unbeliever?&rdquo; Belial is another name for Satan, the Devil. There can be no harmony between Christ and the Devil. We believers are of Christ, and the unbelievers are of Satan. If we have friendship with unbelievers, that means we are making harmony between Christ and Satan. A believer does not have any part with an unbeliever.</p><p>In verse 16 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.&rdquo; Here we see that there can be no agreement between the temple of God and idols. Unbelievers have idols, but we are the temple of God. How then can there be any close relationship between believers and unbelievers?</p><h2 class="head1">THE TEMPLE OF THE LIVING GOD</h2><p>In verse 16 Paul says that we are the temple of the living God. As the living God, God dwells in us and walks in us to be our God in a subjective way that we may partake of Him and be His people, experiencing Him in a living way.</p><p>In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul says that we are the church of the living God. The living God who lives in the church must be subjective to the church and not merely objective. An idol in a heathen temple is lifeless. The God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living. Because He is living, the church is also living in Him, by Him, and with Him. A living God and a living church live, move, and work together. The living church is the house and the household of the living God. Hence, it becomes the manifestation of God in the flesh.</p><p>God has said, &ldquo;I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people&rdquo; (2 Cor. 6:16). This is our situation today. God is living in us, dwelling in us, and walking among us. He is our God, and we are His people.</p><h2 class="head1">SEPARATED AND RECONCILED</h2><p>In verse 17 Paul exhorts the Corinthians, saying, &ldquo;Wherefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean, and I will welcome you.&rdquo; To be separated is to be reconciled, to be brought back, to God (5:20) in a practical way. The words &ldquo;what is unclean&rdquo; denote that which belongs to lawlessness, darkness, Belial, and idols, as listed in verses 14 through 16. By not touching such unclean things we are separated to God and reconciled to Him. Therefore, to come out from their midst and be separated is to be brought back to God. When we are separated in this way, God welcomes us. The words, &ldquo;I will welcome you,&rdquo; point to God&rsquo;s glad receiving of the believers who are fully reconciled, brought back, to Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_113.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_115.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 2 Corinthians &nbsp; pg 114</div><br></body></html>
