<h2 class="head1">KEEPING UP WITH THE FLOW TO TURN THE AGE</h2>
<p>I hope the elderly saints would see that the age has turned. Whether we are an elder or a responsible one, we must realize that there is a flow that is moving forward today. This forward-moving current often may seem turbulent. The modernizing current in Chinese history came at the end of the Ching Dynasty, and no one could stop the current. Those who were wise kept up with it, and those who did not were eliminated. I have studied history seriously, and I know the development of world history, especially over the past hundred years. In my study I see one thing: when the current comes, we must keep up with it, because no one can stop it. It is the same in the Bible. The Lord&rsquo;s move is an unstoppable flow. If the churches want to remain in the way of the past twenty or thirty years, we will fall behind and soon be eliminated.</p>
<p>The truth does not change, but the truth always advances. From Enoch to Noah, from Abraham to David, the truth was advancing. In the New Testament John the Baptist came. His father, Zachariah, was a priest (Luke 1:8-9); hence, John was born a priest. Yet when he came out to serve, he changed the traditions and did everything in a new way. He had a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair and a leather girdle around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey. He did not live in the temple but in the wilderness; he was altogether new in appearance (Matt. 3:4; Luke 3:2-3). Nevertheless, John intrinsically participated in the reality of the things in the Old Testament temple. Similarly, our spirit is not different, but the exercise of our spirit has advanced. Whenever God&rsquo;s people reach a point of doing spiritual things without the spirit, the Lord must have a new beginning, and this brings in a new flow.</p>
<p>In the Far East today, Japan and South Korea do not yet have this problem, but from Taiwan to Indonesia, all the localities have a problem of not making way for the coming of a newer flow. When the flow comes, it is unyielding and uncompromising; everyone must keep up with the spiritual flow. Those who do not keep up with the spiritual flow will be left behind. No one among the twelve apostles whom the Lord Jesus chose was more than thirty years old. When the Lord came, there was a beginning of a new flow that required the coordination of people without oldness in their background.</p>
<p>All the brothers and sisters participating in the service, whether co-workers, elders, or various responsible ones, must see that they can no longer live according to their old experiences and old statuses. A new age has come, and we should keep up with it if we can. If we cannot keep up with it, we should know our limitations and withdraw ourselves, giving room to the able ones so that the younger generation may move forward. All those who have such feelings should give room. Giving such room comes from the great wisdom of knowing one&rsquo;s inability to keep up with the flow of the present age. When the older generation in a family can no longer handle things, either due to capacity, age, strength, or energy, they hand the family business over to their sons or grandsons. Even though the older ones may not be able to keep up with every matter, their rich experiences can still help the next generation to go forward in a good way.</p>
<p>The older ones should see that the age has turned, but the younger ones should respect and obey the older ones. The young people should also never drop the flow or compromise the flow. Their obedience must strengthen the Lord&rsquo;s flow. No matter what the condition of the older brothers is, the younger ones must release their spirit at the bread-breaking meeting. Even if the older brothers are set in an old method, the spirit of the younger ones must be released. The younger ones must be the Lord&rsquo;s army in the meetings to fight for the proper functioning and to swallow up all death with life. Even if a long message is given on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the younger ones should still be overflowing and filled with life.</p>
<p>The co-workers should be clear about our current situation and not give long messages. Forty-five minutes is sufficient for a message that used to take sixty-five minutes. Give the younger ones an opportunity to bring in the flow; everyone needs to cooperate in this. If the elders say that a message should still be given on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, then the younger ones should receive this fellowship. At the same time, the co-workers who used to give messages for thirty-five minutes should speak for only eighteen minutes. Their speaking should be strong in spirit as well as simple, concise, and clear in content and expression. The remaining seventeen minutes should be handed over to the younger ones for them to speak. If the younger ones truly have something, everyone will approve. We should take this spiritual way, and the younger ones must be bold. They should not be discouraged if the elders arrange for messages to be given. Our spirit should be strong in order to deal with the old ways whenever they appear. Nevertheless, we should obey the elders, because what they say is good. We must be able to adapt to the situation. In the end I believe that there will be changes, and the age will turn.</p>
