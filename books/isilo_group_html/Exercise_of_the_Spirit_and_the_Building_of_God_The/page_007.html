THE REALITY OF THE LORD JESUS</h2>
<p>All that God is, is now in the Lord Jesus, and the Lord Jesus is made real as the Spirit; He is realized as the Spirit. The Spirit glorifies the Lord Jesus in us and through us. When we bless and worship the Lord, the Spirit is able to occupy and fill us. The secret and the key to the work of the Spirit in us are that the more we bless and praise the Lord Jesus, the more ground the Spirit has in us and the more He can fill us. We might forget about the Spirit, but as long as we behold the Lord, worship Him, and speak of His beauty, we will be filled with the Spirit. We believe in the Lord Jesus, but we receive the Spirit. We bless the Lord Jesus, but we are filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Let me repeat, all that the Lord Jesus is, is made real in the Spirit. Only the Spirit can make the Lord Jesus real to us. When we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are life,&rdquo; the Spirit will make the Lord real to us as our life. Sometimes we do not know what we need. We might say, &ldquo;Lord, I need You. My situation is too difficult. I do not know whether I need You as life, as light, as the way, or as wisdom. I do not know what I need, but I know that I need You.&rdquo; If we would pray in this way, the Spirit will make a particular aspect of the Lord real to us, according to our need. If we need consolation, the Spirit will make the Lord Jesus real in us as our consolation. If we need light, the Spirit will make the Lord Jesus real in us as our light.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus is all that we need, but our experience of this depends on the Spirit of reality. Only when the Spirit is real to us can we enjoy the Lord Jesus as spiritual food, living water, light, the way, truth, and life. No matter what our need may be, when we call on the Lord Jesus and fellowship with Him, the Spirit will make the Lord real to us in order to meet that need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TURNING FROM OTHER THINGS TO THE LORD JESUS</h2>
<p>When we touch the key, prayer becomes an easy matter. We must not make numerous items the subject of our prayer. We should confess, but this is not the subject of our prayer. A normal Christian should confess his sins at least once a day, but he should not be excessive in confessing his sins. Being excessive can be compared to a disease. I met a brother who had made sins the subject of his prayers. Whenever he prayed, he would say, &ldquo;Lord, I am the most sinful person, and everything related to me, whether at home or in the church, is sinful.&rdquo; He was always confessing his sins. He never thanked the Lord. He never said, &ldquo;Lord, I am sinful, but I thank You because You are Jesus my Savior, and You have saved me from my sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject of our prayer must turn from confessing our sins to praising. The Lord Jesus Christ, not sins or weaknesses, should be the subject of our prayers. Our sins are a black background that cause the Lord of glory to shine forth.</p>
<p>There was a humble and meek brother who always mentioned being weak when he prayed. Initially, his prayers sounded good, but after hearing him pray in this way in a series of meetings, I had a negative feeling within. Paul said that he would most gladly boast in his weaknesses so that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him, for when he was weak, then he was powerful (2 Cor. 12:9-10). This shows that weaknesses should not be the subject of our prayer; only Christ should be the subject. The fact that we are weak should not be our prayer. The strength of Christ can be expressed in our weaknesses. We should be strong when we are weak. We are glad to boast in our weaknesses, but we should not live in our weaknesses. I should be able to say that it is good that we have weaknesses, for through them the Lord&rsquo;s strength can be perfected in us.</p>
<p>We should not continually talk about our weaknesses. The Spirit is not pleased to hear us speak about our weaknesses. The Spirit is pleased to hear us speak concerning Christ. Saying that we are sinful and weak makes the Spirit sorrowful. This is not the purpose of the Spirit. The Spirit convicts us in order to bring us into the reality of Christ. Our need is to behold the Lord Jesus and bless Him. The more we behold and honor Him, the more the Spirit will fill us, and the more ground He will gain in us.</p>
<p>I cannot forget a word that was spoken in January 1934 during an overcoming meeting in Shanghai. A servant of the Lord quoted Griffith Thomas, who said, &ldquo;There is now a common saying that if you look at yourself once, you must then look at Christ ten times. But I think this must be changed to look at Christ eleven times and do not look at yourself even once.&rdquo; This word really helped me to turn my gaze from the things outside of Christ to Christ Himself. That day I saw that only Christ should be my subject.</p>
<p>We should not focus on our weaknesses or our failures. Instead, we should focus on our glorious Lord. We should practice gazing on Him, blessing Him, worshipping Him, and asking Him to be with us. The more we practice this, the more we will be filled with the Spirit, and Christ will be realized in us. We will be delivered not only from sins and the world but also from our natural and individualistic self. We will be saved, and we will enter into God.</p>
<p>We should pray over the verses that we read at the beginning of this chapter. We must forget our problems, weaknesses, and sins and pray over the words in the Bible so that the Lord can gain ground in us. The Bible says that the Lord Jesus is meek, considerate, and full of faith; we should turn these words into prayer. If we would exercise to pray in this way every day, the Spirit will increase in us and fill us. Furthermore, our spirit will become living.</p>
<p>The way to be holy, victorious, and spiritual depends on our prayer. No one can be holy, victorious, or spiritual without prayer, nor can anyone enter into God without prayer. Messages cannot make us holy, victorious, or spiritual. Only prayers that have the Lord Jesus as their subject can make us holy, victorious, and spiritual. There is no need to mention our sins, the world, our bad temper, or our problems. Our only need is to contemplate Him, love Him, praise Him, and speak of Him. If we would do this every day, our sins, the world, and all the demons would depart from us. We do not need to take anything other than the Lord Jesus as our subject. Then we will be holy, victorious, and spiritual, and we will even enter into God as our portion. Furthermore, our spirit will be living because we will be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>I hope that we will all learn to be such praying people. Instead of merely listening to messages or attending meetings, we need to be those who take the Lord as the center of our prayer.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Spirit and the Building of God &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
