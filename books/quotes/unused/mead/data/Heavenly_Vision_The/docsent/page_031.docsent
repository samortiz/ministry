   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why in Romans 12:2 Paul says, "Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be fashioned according to this age is to be conformed to the present course of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead of being conformed to the present age, we should be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Are you clear about what the world is?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anything can become an item of the world to us, if that thing occupies us and preoccupies us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You need to be fully emancipated from every occupying and preoccupying thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The time must come when you will be able to say, "Lord, I praise You that I have been liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have been fully emancipated from every kind of preoccupation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On this earth there is nothing occupying me or preoccupying me."</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You will continue to need food, marriage, clothing, housing, and transportation, but none of these things will occupy or preoccupy you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we see the vision of the world, we will realize that we should not love anything worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not love any occupying or preoccupying thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, we should give our love fully, wholly, and absolutely to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All our capacity is for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the ground, all the room, in us is for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all need the vision of the world that we may see what the world is and how the enemy uses the world to keep us from realizing the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only when we have been liberated from the world will we be fully built up to realize the Body life.</S>
