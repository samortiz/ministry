<h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Keh-Dong County, Heilungkiang, Manchuria</h2><p>We have received one copy of Issue No. 16 of The Open Door. Sending a single copy makes it easier for us to receive it. It enables those brothers in far-off places to know of the footsteps and news of the saints in other places and to see how the Lord protects His children in the midst of difficulties to enjoy peace in Him. It fills our heart with thanksgiving and praise. God has been continually gracious to us in the meetings here. May we continually pray. The amount of money which we have sent through Brother Tien is to be used toward the need of item number four mentioned in "A Word on Behalf of the Editor" in Issue No. 16. May the Lord direct you to distribute it. (This amount has been distributed to the needy saints in northern Kiangsu&mdash;Editor.) Greetings to the saints in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Ren Jin-yi, May 11</p><h2 class="head2">Mo-Gan-Shan, Chekiang Province</h2><p>We can only describe our condition in the mountains with Psalm 91:2-7. A crisis happened suddenly. The Sun and Yu families are safe. This is comforting. The Lord's grace abides forever. Has Brother Tang returned to Shanghai? Where is Brother Chou Shin-yih? We are remembering many brothers and sisters in our prayers, and we need you to pray for us as well. The Lord's work increased in the midst of tribulation. There are now believers even in this little corner of the mountain regions. May all the glory go to Him, amen. The mail route has not been cleared yet, and we are sending this letter through Mu-Er.</p><p>Sun Wen-yuen and Chen Yao-jen, May 19</p><h2 class="head2">Lan-Si, Chekiang Province</h2><p>We have forwarded X dollars through Brother Chang Yu-zhi's hand. X dollars are for the needy saints who are in the midst of the war zones (Heb. 13:3). This amount was collected from offering boxes in various places. It is the willing offering of the saints. On the first day of the first month of the year, some decided to skip a meal, and others decided to eat only light porridge for a few meals or to save up money by other means to make this offering for the purpose of caring for the saints in need because of the war. We are learning to walk according to God's commandment.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Ma Chuan-foo, April 23</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-sha, Hunan Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Philip in the Lord:</p><p>During the past few days I felt that I had to take care of a few things personally, one of which is related to the passing away of my friend Ji Dun-wu of Shou-Jou, who is now with the Lord. God's will is always the best. Since my two long-standing friends are no longer with me, I have felt even more busy. My health is not good, and letters are piling up, waiting for my answer. I have been tired daily. Originally, I asked my co-workers to write this letter on my behalf, and then I would make the draft and sign it in order to save some energy. But sometimes I feel that I have to write a letter in my own handwriting. Furthermore, I would like the friends in Shanghai to know of the passing away of Mr. Ji Dun-wu. I still need others to pray for my health. Peace in the Lord. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Cheng Ji-guei, Ch'ang-sha Bible School, May 31</p><h2 class="head2">Tung-Ping, Hunan Province</h2><p>Our dear brother Zhang Gun-jih rested in the Lord at 6:00 a.m. on May 30! We thank all the brothers and sisters in the Lord who prayed for and asked about him in brotherly love. During the first semester of last year, Brother Zhang was led of the Lord to come to Yi-Yang to teach English at the Lutheran High School. After classes he would always talk with the students about the salvation of the Lord. In the evening he would study the original language of the Scripture with the help of a certain Western brother. On the Lord's Day he would conduct either two or three meetings. During the summer vacation he traveled to and from Ch'ang-sha twice in order to serve the brothers and to conduct conferences. He did not rest the whole summer, and his poor health deteriorated into illness. Brother Zhang always had a desire to pioneer in the frontier lands. Two days before he died, he said, "The work should be initiated by prayer and progress from places that are near to places that are faraway." His concern for the service of the Lord was seen in his heart, in his prayer, and in his words. Brother Zhang is gone, but his testimony will have a lasting effect on the Western and Chinese brothers and sisters in Hunan. His family is in a dire condition. Please pray for them.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Yu Yien-chuan, May 31</p>
