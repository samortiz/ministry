   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING BUILT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UPON THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 12 and Romans 12 show us that in God's arrangement or plan, there is no such thing as a pastor monopolizing the service of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Neither is there such a thing as a group of brothers and sisters serving while another group of brothers and sisters is being served.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What we see in the Bible is the whole Body being a priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is comprised of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's intention was for the Israelites to be a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in actuality, not everyone was a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The situation among the local churches today is a little bit better.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The brothers and sisters have the liberty to pray, to sing, to preach, and to take up responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we have to realize that this is still not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is built upon the universal priesthood of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is not built upon a few brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the priesthood is not universal, we have Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the priesthood is universal, we have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to see that service to God is not a matter of three or five people serving, or thirty or fifty people serving.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our service to God today must be entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to serve God today, everyone has to rise up to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NOT THE SERVICE OF THE MINISTERS,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BUT THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we were in Foochow, we noted the fact that in the past century, God raised up many spiritual giants, and that all of them were outstanding people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From 1820 until now, many spiritual giants have been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet strangely, among us today we see very few spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It seems as if the spiritual giants are all gone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we do not see the work of gospel preaching being done through the so-called great evangelists, men like Charles Finney and Stanley.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not easy to find giants like these anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seems as if God is taking a different way today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today is the day of the service of the church, not the service of the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is no longer a matter of individuals preaching the gospel, but a matter of the church preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Previously, we had to invite famous and eloquent speakers to come to preach the gospel, and we had to use much propaganda.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But today the church is coordinating together to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>NOT INDIVIDUALS PREACHING THE GOSPEL,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BUT THE CHURCH PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Take the case of Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Recently, when the brothers were preaching the gospel, we had some brothers giving messages on the platform, but there were no advertisements and no famous speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One brother who had been saved for only two or three years was doing the preaching, and all the other brothers and sisters went out to invite friends.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Twenty to fifty brothers and sisters could bring in four or five hundred people, and four or five hundred people could bring in a few thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before the speaker stood up, two or three hundred people were saved already.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those brothers and sisters who brought their friends along with them knew if the friends sitting next to them were saved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The speaker on the platform could be deceived, but the brothers and sisters were clear about the condition of their friends.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They could say that this one who stood up was genuine, and that one who stood up was not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the meeting they helped their gospel friends become clearer concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They helped them write down their names, showed them the direction to the meeting halls, and visited those who expressed their willingness to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Within one month in Foochow, almost a thousand people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today some people are still opposing, and this is why our work is still not that strong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there is no frustration, I believe that all of Foochow can be taken over by us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today the church is not a few special brothers rising up to preach the gospel; it is the whole church rising up to preach the gospel.</S>
