   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 11 says, "His head is as the most fine gold; his locks are bushy, and black as a raven."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The "most fine gold" refers to His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He possesses God's life and God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily" Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has established this Christ as our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything that is of God is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nothing that is of God is absent from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, if we are "holding the Head," we can grow "with the growth of God" v. 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"His locks are bushy, and black as a raven."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be black as a raven signifies His eternal power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He manifests Himself as the Ancient of Days, He displays His white hair Rev 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But what is portrayed here is His eternal and unfading power; therefore, His hair is black.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Bible describes a man's condition as being degenerating and fading, it speaks of his gray hairs Hosea 7:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But our Lord does not have any gray hair.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is "the same yesterday and today, yes, even forever" Heb 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 12 says, "His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The eyes express the sentiments, and these sentiments are intimate sentiments.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man's words and letters can express sentiments that can be felt from a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the sentiments of the eyes cannot be felt unless a person is very close.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The most beautiful thing about doves is their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"By the rivers of waters" speaks of their wetness, "washed with milk" speaks of their whiteness, and "fitly set" speaks of their orderliness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's eyes express His sentiments toward us, and to the believers these eyes are as beautiful as doves' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are full of vigor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are not dry, they are like those by the rivers of waters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are distinct and clear, as if washed with milk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are fitly set and have a healthy vision; they never make a mistake through faltering eyesight.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 13 says, "His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His two cheeks once suffered man's smiting Isa 50:6 and were reviled by men Matt 27:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is no wonder that the believers consider His cheeks as a bed of spices and as sweet flowers, beautiful as well as fragrant.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Lips" denotes the words that come from His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How pure are these words, and they are as fragrant as the droppings of myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Grace is poured upon Your lips" Psa 45:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is no wonder that men praised Him and marveled at the words of grace that came from His mouth Luke 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The droppings of myrrh do not mean just grace; they are related to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This denotes the grace that issues forth from His death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His lips drop myrrh; every word of grace that comes out of His mouth is based on His death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether it is, "Your sins are forgiven...Go in peace" 7:48-50 , "He who believes has eternal life" John 6:47 , or "Rise and take up your mat and walk" Mark 2:9 , all these words are based on His death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 14 says, "His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word "rings" is the same word as "folding" in 1 Kings 6:34.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The purpose of the folding is to prevent something from slipping and being lost.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The gold rings tell us that the works of the Lord Jesus are capable of accomplishing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They will not fail halfway, because all the works issue from God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the rings are gold.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"Beryl" is mentioned a few times in the Old Testament, including Ezekiel 1:16 and Daniel 10:6.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In both places, the meaning is stability.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the former verse, though the Gentiles reigned, God's governmental wheel made of beryl still turned.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the latter verse, we see the Christ of God whose body is beryl arbitrating the destiny of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, both the gold rings and the beryl speak of the stability of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word "belly" is the same as the word "bowels" in Songs of Songs 5:4.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that the Lord is a man of deep feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These feelings are directed toward His people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"Ivory" is not like gems, which are without life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to have ivory, there must first be sufferings or even death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This signifies that the Lord's feeling for His people comes from His suffering and the great price He has paid.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"Bright" can be translated as "wrought work of."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A wrought work is a fine work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows us that all His feelings are not shallow or casual.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"Sapphires," according to the Bible, are "the body of heaven in his clearness" Exo 24:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These sapphires overlay the perimeters.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that when His feeling comes into contact with us, the contact is under the control of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Verse 15 says, "His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the Bible, the feet indicate movement, while "legs" signify an upright posture.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"Marble" is translated many times in the Bible as "fine linen."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here it signifies His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"Pillars" signify gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that our Lord and all He has are unshakable because of the righteousness He has established.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All those who have followed Him cannot fail to have this impression.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the maiden's description of her beloved, she mentions gold three times.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This means that the thoughts in His mind, the works of His hands, and the stability of His feet are all of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God controls His whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is a totally submissive person, who fully satisfies God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the One whom we know.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"His countenance is as Lebanon."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is higher than the earth, and He is living in the high places.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everything about Him speaks of Him as a heavenly person.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>"Excellent as the cedars."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is a man, yet a glorified man.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Just as the cedar tree far transcends over all other trees, He is the only glorified man among all men.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Verse 16 says, "His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Finally, His mouth is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The word "mouth" is not just the ordinary mouth, but the mouth with special reference to the taste.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This word is the same as the word "taste" in 2:3.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is very different from the lips.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The taste refers to the mediatorial work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It means that everything from God is first tasted by Him before being transferred to us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Everything of God is first stored in Christ and then dispensed to us through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is His mediatorial work, and it is very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>After we have known Him in this way, we cannot help but acknowledge that everything is of God and through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>At this point, the listener's heart cannot help but be warmed, and the speaker's heart cannot help but be even warmer.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In reviewing the way we have taken, and considering the Lord whom we confess, we cannot help but exclaim, "He is altogether lovely."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Anything that we speak of concerning Him is altogether lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Those who have not yet followed the Lord in an absolute way should realize that this is our Beloved!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is our Friend!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Can we be blamed for seeking after Him?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This description of her impression of the Lord is in a sense a description of the very Lord she knows.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is also a description of what she has received of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is also a description of her union with the Lord and the fellowship that has resulted from this union.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Since she has seen the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face, she is reflecting His glory like a mirror and is being transformed to the Lord's image, from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>By the end of her speaking, the sun has dawned upon her soul.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Her words are full of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It is as if she is singing and proclaiming, "He is altogether lovely.</S>
