   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. In the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul's word in the New Testament is clear enough.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Corinthians 7:39, he told the widows to marry those who were in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second Corinthians 6:14 is a well-known portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It says that believers and unbelievers should not share the same yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These words do not refer to only marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But they certainly speak also of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Believers and unbelievers should not be engaged in the same business; they should not join themselves in one goal, like two animals plowing the field with one yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God does not allow this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does not allow a believer and an unbeliever to bear the same yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Old Testament, an ox and a horse could not be yoked together, and an ass could not be equally yoked with a horse.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You cannot have one that is fast and another that is slow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is impossible to have one going one direction and the other going another direction, or one turning to heaven and the other turning to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You cannot have one seeking after spiritual blessings and the other seeking after worldly riches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is impossible for one to pull in one direction and the other to pull in the other direction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you do, the yoke will break.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of all unequally yoked relationships, none is more serious than the marriage relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One may be unequally yoked with others in business ventures or in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But no yoke is more severe than the marriage yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a believer and an unbeliever share the responsibility of a family together, the result will be nothing but problems.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The ideal marriage partner is a brother or a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Never choose an unbeliever capriciously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you pick out an unbeliever carelessly, you will surely encounter problems later.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One will be pulling to one side, and the other will be pulling to the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One will turn to heaven, and the other will turn to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One will seek a heavenly gift, and the other will seek worldly riches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The difference between the two is tremendous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why the Bible charges us to marry those in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>V. IF MARRIED TO AN UNBELIEVER</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But here is a problem: Suppose a brother is already married to an unbeliever, or a sister is already married to an unbelieving husband.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What should they do?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We mentioned earlier that a single person should seek a partner who is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, there are some who are already married.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They already have an unbelieving wife or an unbelieving husband.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What should they do?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A. If He Wants to Go Away</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians 7 has something to say about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verses 12, 13, and 15 address this point.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They tell us what to do when a dispute arises in a family that has only one member who is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please bear in mind that many such families today complain little, simply because the believers in these families are not absolute enough.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus predicted in the Gospels that there would be much contention within the family.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a believer is absolute, there is bound to be contention in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There are cases of "three against two and two against three," as in Luke 12:52, because some family members have become believers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose a husband leaves his wife because she has believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose he says, "You have believed in the Lord; I do not want you anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What should the wife do?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord's word in 1 Corinthians 7 is clear enough: "Let him separate" v. 15 . Therefore, if a husband wants to separate because the wife has believed in the Lord, or vice versa, the word is, "Let him separate."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, one thing must be clear: You must not be the one who initiates the separation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You must not be the one who asks for the separation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The other party must be the one who asks for it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the one who is not happy with your faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is the one who thinks that there is no future with you now that you have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is he who wants to go.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If he wants to separate, "Let him separate."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>B. If He Does Not Care, the Lord Will Save Him</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul said that there is no need to separate if the other party does not care.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How do you know that the Lord will not save him through you?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If he does not care and wants to continue living with you, Paul said that you should be at peace with him and should not leave.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He said that an unbeliever can be sanctified through a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He said also, "For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?" v. 16 . If the other party wants to leave, that is his concern, not yours.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if he does not want to leave, you have to believe that the Lord will save him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul said that it would be easy for him to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It may not be that easy for the Lord to save others, but it would surely be easy for the Lord to save one who is already yours.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to deal with this matter by taking such a stand.</S>
