   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE MAN-MADE VICTORY Date: December 18, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Col 3:4; Phil 1:21; Gal 2:20; 1 Cor 1:30</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Tonight we will continue with the subject of God's sal- vation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From the day that man sinned, the way to the tree of life was guarded by the cherubim and access to it was taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God no longer allowed a sinner to eat directly of the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From that time forward, man first had to pass through God's redemption before he could receive God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God sent Christ to accomplish the work of redemption on the one hand, and to dispense to us His own life on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a man believes in the Lord, not only are his sins forgiven, but he also receives God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>ABNORMAL EXPERIENCES AMONG CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After a man is saved and has received God's life, a number of problems often arise.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, he still sins in his daily life even though he has believed in Christ and received Him as his Savior and life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, even though he is able to have a sweet and intimate fellowship with God at times, the fellowship does not last for long.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He may feel wonderful in the morning for an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But by the time he goes to school, to his office, or to contact others in the hospital, the deep sense of fellowship with God is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He discovers that not only does he have besetting sins, but he is unable to have a sustained and sweet fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Third, there is always the problem of not receiving an answer to our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible does not say that receiving an answer to prayer is the experience of some special kind of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No. Everyone who prays to God should receive answers to his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible promises us that we can enjoy the Father's care all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet how many of our prayers are answered?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is it not true that they are so few in number that we can count them on our fingers?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's provision for Christians includes answers to prayer every day; there should always be experiences of answers to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But many people find that they have experienced very few answers to their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fourth, there is a problem in understanding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many people read the Bible without understanding it; they only touch the letters of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible is nothing but black and white letters to them; there is no revelation, light, or understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has given this book to men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This book is the word of God; it is what men need for their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's children should receive nourishment from His Word every day, morning and evening, just like taking meals every day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's intention is that when we open up the Bible, we would find joy, light, spiritual nourishment, and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet many people open the Bible merely for the purpose of bribing their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not the proper way for a Christian to live.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fifth, there is a problem in understanding God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sheep know the voice of their master.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the same way, every child of God should know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are in the New Testament age; this is not like the time of Exodus, when the Lord had to lead the Israelites out by their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today, everyone can know God's will inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hebrews 8 says that God has placed His laws within a Christian's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A Christian does not need to teach his neighbor or brother, because all will know God, from the little one to the great one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A New Testament believer does not need to continually seek counsel from others concerning God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In actuality, however, many people do not understand God's will nor can they obey God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not what a normal Christian life should be.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sixth, there is the problem of an unwillingness to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A victorious Christian has a heart that wants to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He does not bargain with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has the power within him to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A victorious Christian does not dodge the cross; instead, he embraces the cross with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to admit that many are not living this kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All of the above conditions are abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God has prepared a full salvation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is saving us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we cannot experience God's full salvation, it means that there are problems on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible shows us what a victorious Christian is like.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are at least six conditions of a victorious Christian: 1 He should have overcome all known sins; this is the most basic condition.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>2 He should be able to sustain an intimate fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>3 He should receive answers to his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>4 He should enjoy reading the Word and be able to understand and receive light and supply from it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>5 He should fully understand God's will, and know God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>6 He should be able to obey God.</S>
