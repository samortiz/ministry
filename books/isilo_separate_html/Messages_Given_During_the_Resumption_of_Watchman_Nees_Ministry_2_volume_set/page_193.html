Our work needs money. From now on, we have to work with a goal and with proper arrangements. All the co-workers are living for the Lord. We ask all the brothers and sisters on the job to offer up themselves also. We have to work in coordination and in the Body. None of us is for ourselves. We must live for the Lord and for the gospel. We cannot have part of the people offering up themselves, while part of the people are not offering up themselves. We need all the brothers and sisters to offer up themselves and to live for the gospel. Those who are teaching or who are in business have to offer up their all for the gospel. The Lord has to do what He did in the first century. We are not afraid of believing in the first-century gospel. We are not afraid of preaching the first-century gospel. We are not afraid of doing what the first-century gospel did. If we would rise up as a whole Body, the whole of China will be taken; no one will be able to withstand us. If we do not believe in a thorough gospel, and if we do not have a thorough consecration, it will be difficult for the Lord to use us.</P><P>The gospel has been preached in China for over a century. All the time, it has been restricted to the coastal regions. Not much has been done in the inland regions. We have wasted twenty years. If we are not faithful again, we will be set aside.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A STRONG TESTIMONY PRODUCING A STRONG RESULT</H2><P>In the first century, men were not able to preach the gospel freely. They could not go to the church buildings. At that time, men believed because they saw the gospel and they saw the Christians. The Christians at that time were hiding in their homes. It was when they were put on the fiery stakes that they were seen and heard for the first time. The effect of seeing the gospel is much stronger than that of hearing the gospel. This kind of gospel shows men that salvation is not cheap. The prayer of the martyrs during those hours became their gospel messages. Historians tell us that the believers in Rome were killed first, and the ones who were not killed were exiled.</P><P>Today, Christianity is weak in others because it is weak in us. During the first century, men were afraid, yet they kept coming. Today, lukewarm Christians are useless ones. On the one hand, the testimonies of the early believers frightened many people away. But on the other hand, this kind of gospel also made many frightened of running away. Where there is the apostles' service, there is the apostles' blessing. Today, the whole responsibility rests on our work. If the Lord cannot get through among us, He cannot get through anywhere. The past twenty years were the Lord's preparation of us, while we were praying and seeking during that time. However, if the young ruler is to come today, he may not wait any longer. Today, we have to offer up all our money, time, and heart. Only then will the Lord have a way, and only then can we reach our destiny. Do not allow money to choke our heart, and do not allow it to block man's way to God. All the brothers and sisters have to participate in the spiritual work, and all the possessions have to be offered up. If we do this, the Lord will have a free way among us.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_192.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_194.html">Next</a> </body></html>
