BEING TO BE FILLED WITH GOD<br />
AND THUS UNDER THE HEAVENLY RULE</h2>
<p>A living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is not cultivated through human effort. Instead, a living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is God being lived out from within men. The spirit is for God; thus, to be poor in spirit is to seek God. To be pure in heart is to want God and then to see, gain, and be filled with God. As a result, the kingdom people live out the God whom their spirit desires and their heart seeks. God becomes their appearance, just as He is their content. Their content is the condition of their heart, and their appearance is their outward living. Within them there is no room for the self; there is room only to be filled with God. Outwardly, there is no expression of the flesh; there is only God lived out. Therefore, they are called sons of God, for their living is the same as the living of the Lord Jesus, the Son of God.</p>
<p>In addition, such a living is wholly based on man allowing heaven to rule, because the first blessing says, &ldquo;Theirs is the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (v. 3). Concerning their living, the Lord again said that theirs is the kingdom of the heavens (v. 10). The kingdom people can endure persecution for the sake of righteousness because theirs is the kingdom of the heavens. This means that they are under the heavenly rule. The kingdom people do not resist persecution, because heaven rules and has dominion over them; they are unable to resist, but this is not because they do not have the flesh. They are ruled by heaven to such an extent that if they feel indignant and disagree with persecution, they are rebuked within and sense that they are overthrowing God&rsquo;s authority and rebelling against God&rsquo;s ordination. For this reason, they can be meek and accept, not resist, persecution.</p>
<p>We should pay attention to two things. One is to be filled with God and to live God out, and the other is to accept the heavenly rule and to submit to the heavenly dominion. This describes a person living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. This is also the nature of the kingdom people. When we are filled with God, we can submit to the heavenly rule, and our submitting to the heavenly rule is for living God out. Both being filled with God and submitting to the heavenly rule are indispensable. Those who are filled with God and submit to the heavenly rule are spiritual. God wants to gain such ones in this age.</p>
<p>The Lord said that those who are thus filled with God and ruled by heaven are blessed. In this section the Lord said &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; nine times. In the original Greek <em>blessed</em> implies &ldquo;happy.&rdquo; Hence, <em>blessed</em> can also be rendered as &ldquo;blessed and happy.&rdquo; People in the world seek blessing and happiness, and they want to be blessed and happy. However, earthly things are not the real blessings, nor do they bring happiness. From the Lord&rsquo;s perspective, those who are filled with God, who let heaven rule, and who live God out are blessed and happy. Only such people have true blessings and genuine happiness.</p>
<p>Some are filled with fear when they hear a message concerning the kingdom of the heavens. They say, &ldquo;Who can do this? Is it not miserable to live under such conditions?&rdquo; However, the Lord said that such people are blessed; they are happy. Are human thoughts correct, or are the Lord&rsquo;s words correct? I hope that we will all have a change in concept to see that living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens does not require our doing. If the Lord wanted us to exercise our own efforts to live in the kingdom of the heavens, He would have presented the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 1. Rather, in chapter 1 He wants us to see that He is Emmanuel in order to save us into glory (vv. 21-23). The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the goal for which the Lord saves us. He has come to give us life, and He rules in order to save us into the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. This is the blessed and happy condition of a believer.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Living and Principles of the Kingdom People &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
