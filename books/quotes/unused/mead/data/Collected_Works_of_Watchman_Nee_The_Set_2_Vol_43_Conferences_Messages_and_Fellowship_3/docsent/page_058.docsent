   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTY-TWO THE MIND OF CHRIST JESUS 2 Date: April 4, 1938</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Penang</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Phil 2:5-7 BECOMING IN THE LIKENESS OF MEN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we will continue to consider the mind of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we want to consider His taking the form of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, we want to consider His becoming in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In humbling Himself, the Lord Jesus gave up His form of God and took the form of a slave to become a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He took a position that He did not have to take and received what He should not have received.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>BEING LIMITED, GIVING UP HIS FREEDOM</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord became in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He put on flesh and blood to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Outwardly He was a man, but inwardly He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was God from the beginning, omnipotent and omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was Spirit, and His Spirit filled the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when He became a man, His Spirit became bound by His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The omnipresent God was bound by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where the flesh went, the Godhead within went.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was a great restriction for the Lord to become in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was omnipotent, and His power was infinite.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when He walked on the earth as a man, He was placed under great restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although He performed many miracles in His days, He performed them only to the extent that His flesh allowed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There were many other things that He was restricted from doing because of the limitations of His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was limited by the weakness of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He could become tired and sleepy, and He could feel pain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He could not be as free as God was.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as He lived in the flesh, He had to abide by the law of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sleep is an enjoyment for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the Lord was God, and He needed no sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet He slept the same way we sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His sleeping was a kind of restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He had to live like every other ordinary human being, growing from infancy to adulthood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a wonder just imagining that the omniscient God needed to grow up!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord's being a slave meant that He gave up His glory, while the Lord's being a man meant that He gave up His freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all want to be like the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We desire to have the mind of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But are we willing to give up our glory and freedom?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All limitation is for our benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God stretches forth His restraining hand upon us, we should not resist.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we should accept it with joy and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But how many times do we yearn for freedom?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to submit to the limitations that God has imposed upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to accept them with fortitude.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God puts His restraining hand upon us and takes away our freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not learn this lesson through the environment, God will not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if we are willing to submit and learn what God wants us to learn, He will liberate us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the cross comes and we try to run away or give up, we will find that everything seems to turn us farther away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the condition of many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They struggle with their environment and try to rid themselves of God's bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They want to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the Christian life can only be manifested through the environment it passes through.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A smooth environment often works against the manifestation of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a person is put in an adverse environment, he may get angry, but if Christ is in him, he will gladly give up his freedom when he is restricted on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The worst thing that can happen to a Christian is to rebel against God's arrangement in his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must never resist any of God's arrangement in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jesus Christ willingly put Himself under limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should do the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A restricted environment reveals our true condition; it tells whether we are growing or failing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Blessed are those who do not complain but rather praise in the midst of their restrictions!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their hearts are in harmony with God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the cross comes to us, it not only strips us of our glory, but it also takes away our freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yet most Christians today try to dodge the cross to avoid pain.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As a result, we see very few marks of the cross in these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Their self is fat and big.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is true that they have avoided much pain, but it is also true that there are few marks of the cross in them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The whole issue rests on whether or not we are willing to allow ourselves to be afflicted for the accomplishment of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our natural life must be broken before there can be sustained and genuine growth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In our home, at work, and in the church, God has provided us with many limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These are opportunities from the Lord to smooth out our rough edges.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God has placed some brothers and sisters in the church who can neither help us nor accomplish anything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All they can do is cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Why does God put all these people in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>His goal is to make these ones our limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should not struggle to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Freedom will not build us up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The building work comes when we are restricted in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>David chose smooth stones 1 Sam 17:40 because the weight of smooth stones is evenly distributed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The power came from David's hand, but only smooth stones could draw such power from David.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the same way, God wants to use smooth stones today.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God has placed us in the church because we are sharp and pointed.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Often the storm comes, and we are shaken, chipped, and rubbed against one another.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But as we remain in this environment for three or five years, we are smoothed out.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But how painful it is when we are being rubbed away!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>However, unless we are rubbed, we will never become smooth.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Unfortunately, many people try to dodge.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When the cross comes to them, they struggle to free them- selves, and they cry for freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They may reduce their pain, but they miss the lessons that God has ordained for them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God has given us the cross so that we will yield to His sovereignty, become totally submissive, and never resist.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He wants all of us to learn to become a limited person.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>THOSE WHO ACCEPT GOD'S LIMITATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Madam Guyon was born of a French noble family.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>She was attractive and dignified.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Many people admired and adored her.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But when God gained her, she learned all the lessons that God gave to her within a period of two years.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When she was infected with smallpox, Louis XIV sent her some ointment to put on her face so that she would not have a pock-marked face.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Yet she prayed, "God, if having a pock-marked face pleases You, why should my face be smooth?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If it is Your intention for me to be pock-marked, I would rather find an ointment that makes my face more pock-marked!"</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Consider this!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The most admired beauty in the whole of Paris would readily relinquish her beauty for the sake of obedience to God!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is what it means to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is what it means to know the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>She said, "If God would chastise me with a rod or a whip, I would kiss the hand that is chastising."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>She was thoroughly acquainted with the cross and perfectly submissive under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>What a pity that many people murmur against God for their handicaps; their hearts are full of bitter complaints.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But there are also those who, though handicapped for life, willingly submit to the sovereign hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When they conclude that it is God's pleasure that they be handicapped, they receive their lot from God gladly.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We have to learn to be those who know God and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>A few famous hymns in our hymnal were written by an able writer who lived over fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>She was bedridden for most of her life, from age seven until she was fifty or sixty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>But she could write hymns and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Today men still love her hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Blessed are those who are limited, who accept God's limitations, who submit to His arrangement, and who yield to the mighty, sovereign hand of the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Where there is submission, there is life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I love the story of Job He said, "Behold, if he slay me, yet would I trust in him" Job 13:15, Darby .</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He also said, "He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass" 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Thank God that there are walls.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Although the walls have taken away our freedom, the same walls have kept Satan from crossing God's boundary to attack us further.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We should learn to be those who live within the walls.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We should not try to be free, and we should not struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We should learn to be limited and accept what we do not like.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If we do this, we will learn the lesson of the cross.</S>
