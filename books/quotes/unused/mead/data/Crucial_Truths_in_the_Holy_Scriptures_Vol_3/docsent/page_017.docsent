   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word of the Lord s gospel is the seed of life, and a person s heart is like a field of earth for planting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we preach the gospel to people, we are sowing the seed of the Lord s gospel into the field of their hearts.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, a brother who is baptized today may have received a gospel tract which gave him an impression of the gospel five years ago in another place.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those whom the Lord wants to save are the harvest He wants to reap.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our preaching of the gospel is for harvesting these people.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, he endeavored to preach the gospel to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This word shows that preaching the gospel is the repayment of a debt, which is the fifth expression for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to this expression, preaching the gospel to our relatives, friends, and those to whom we are close is the repayment of a debt.</S>

   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we have such a spirit of the gospel, we spontaneously have a proper attitude toward the gospel outwardly.</S>
