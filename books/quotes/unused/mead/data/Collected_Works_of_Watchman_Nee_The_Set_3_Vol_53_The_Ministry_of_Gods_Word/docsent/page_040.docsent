   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our Lord taught many things when He was on the earth, and many heard Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 8 the Lord Jesus said many things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He spoke of an adulterous woman being forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later He told the Jews that the truth would set them free and that they did not have to remain slaves but could be free instead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Jews responded by saying that they were the descendants of Abraham and were not slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Lord replied that everyone who sins is a slave of sin vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>32-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Jews might or might not have understood this word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet they certainly could not say that they had not heard it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their ears were not heavy, and they were not deaf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet the Lord Jesus said something very peculiar: "He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God" v. 47 . Hearing something involves more than just hearing the voice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some people hear the voice and have God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Others hear the voice but do not have God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we were to ask the Jews whether or not they had heard the Lord's words, they would have said yes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet the Lord said that they had not heard anything, because they were not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a very sobering matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One does not hear God's speaking simply by being at the place where He is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A man may be present at the site of the speaking and yet hear nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He may hear all the sounds and all the words, but the Lord Jesus may say that he has not heard anything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The hearing referred to by the Lord Jesus is something totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are two kinds of hearing, and they belong to two different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One can hear things of one realm but may not hear things of the other realm.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a basic problem with many people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They hear the words of the Scripture, but they do not hear God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord was speaking to these people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot say that they were all fools.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot say that they were all sick in their mind or heavy in their ears.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They all knew what the Lord was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Otherwise, how could they have rebuffed the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They rebuffed Him because they had all heard His word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus said that those who are of God hear God's words but that the others did not hear because they were not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is where the fundamental problem lies.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many people only hear voices from one realm; they do not hear any voice from the other realm.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They only understand words from one realm; they do not understand any word from the other realm.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They do not hear because they are not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus was saying that some do not understand His word because they are wrong in their person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 43 the Lord Jesus said, "Why do you not understand My speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is because you cannot hear My word."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Fleshly ears can only hear words of flesh; they can only hear words from one realm.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Words from the other realm can only be heard with a different kind of ear.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only those who are of God can hear; those who are not of God cannot hear.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When many people come to the Bible, they only hear the outward shell of the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They only grasp the appearance of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But God's word is in an entirely different realm.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must deal with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we cannot hear His word, we cannot be ministers of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What do we mean when we say that a man does not hear God's word?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is possible for the Lord Jesus to stand in front of you and speak for two hours, yet you hear nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that you have not heard God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may hear everything that the Lord says and write it all down.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When you go home, you may memorize it all, yet you still have not heard anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, you have heard nothing of God's speaking; you have only touched the outward shell of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have heard it, yet you still do not understand it, and it has not entered into you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some people are all the time touching the outward shell of the Bible; they think that they are ministers of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But we must emphasize that this is not what is required at all.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today inspiration must be complemented by revelation before it can become God's speaking; inspiration alone is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible is God's inspiration, but it must be complemented by revelation before it can be called God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If all we have is inspiration, we do not have God's speaking; instead, we only have the outward shell of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may boast that we have read the Bible a great deal, but I do not know if we have heard God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot deny that those in John 8 heard the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yet the Lord said that they had not heard it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must understand what God's word is.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God's word is the word behind the word, the voice behind the voice, and the language behind the language.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What makes God's word so special is that the natural ear, the ear of flesh, can hear His word and yet this hearing does not count.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A man may be very intelligent in his natural makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He may be very capable, possessing very quick thoughts and a very good mind.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do you think that such a person can hear the Lord's word?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Please remember that his hearing may only touch the outward shell of the Lord's word; it may only touch the things related to the physical side of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This hearing only brings a person into contact with the physical realm; it does not bring him into contact with the spiritual realm of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's word belongs to another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is wrong to presume that anyone can hear God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No, only those who belong to God can hear this word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whether or not there is the capacity to hear depends on the very person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If my physical ears have a problem, I cannot hear the Lord Jesus' word in one realm.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If my spiritual ears have a problem, I cannot hear the Lord Jesus' word in another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I can be in two realms, and His word can be in two realms as well.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>One of these realms is physical, and the other is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If I remain in the physical realm, the most I can hear is the physical side of the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I can hear and understand it, but the Lord will still say that I have not heard it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He does not want me to hear those kinds of words.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He wants me to hear words of another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There may be thousands and millions of men who have heard one kind of words, but there may be only eight or ten people who have heard the other kind of words.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the problem with many people when they come to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They only touch the outward fa ade of the Bible without touching the Christ who is within the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is like a man touching Jesus without touching the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is useless to just see the Bible, the book, without touching God's word or His Christ.</S>
