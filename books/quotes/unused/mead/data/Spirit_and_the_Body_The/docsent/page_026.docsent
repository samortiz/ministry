   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he received authority to persecute and even kill the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Acts 9 his intention was to bind all those who called on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that the Christians in ancient times were the calling ones.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you call on His name, you are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you call on His name, you will be filled with the Spirit, saturated with the Spirit, permeated with the Spirit, and soaked with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you call on the name of Jesus, the Spirit will be poured out upon you.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nothing is as defiling as death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although I do not encourage you to be beside yourself, I would like to impress you and even to charge you to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who do can testify that it certainly makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I expect that the time will come when we shall all be accustomed to calling on the name of the Lord Jesus all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before you read the Bible, try calling on the name of the Lord Jesus for a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What a difference it will make in your reading of the Scriptures!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although it will not change the Bible, it will change you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You will be living, and your spirit will be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mere knowledge is useless, but calling, "O Lord Jesus" is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you know the way to receive the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no need to wrinkle your brow or fast for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord never predestined you to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, He destined you to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His economy He has already accomplished everything for the inward and outward experiences of the Spirit, for the indwelling of the Spirit, and for the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now He is here as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This Spirit includes the Savior, the Redeemer, and the Life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is waiting not for you to fast or to pray, but to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is waiting for you to breathe the name of Jesus and to drink of life indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I encourage you to try it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the local churches must be calling churches, and every saint in the Lord's recovery must be one who calls on the name of the Lord.</S>
