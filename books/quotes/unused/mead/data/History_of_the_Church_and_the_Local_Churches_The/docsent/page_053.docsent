   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brother Nee was wise to flee and escape from Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Otherwise, he would have been arrested by the Japanese military police.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He went to the interior of China and carried on his pharmaceutical factory in Chungking, the capital of China during the war.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Samuel Chang was a great help to Brother Nee in that pharmaceutical factory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Due to the great turmoil in the church in Shanghai, Brother Nee had no other choice but to stop his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His ministry was stopped for six years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was a rumor that he was too occupied with his pharmaceutical business and did not have the time to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was false.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did not minister because of the rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the last and greatest suffering which Brother Nee had to endure before his imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1948 a big revival was brought in among us, and Brother Nee returned to his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through that revival nearly all the rebellious ones repented to him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Though many had become rebellious toward Brother Nee, they were not against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was a real testimony that almost everyone stayed with the church and did not go back to the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During the time of the rebellion, some went to Brother Nee and encouraged him to set up another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said that this should not be done.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He told these saints that regardless of whether the church was against him or for him, it was still the church, and they had to continue in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Brother Nee returned to his ministry, there was a bigger revival.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church then decided to buy a big piece of land for a meeting hall that could seat three thousand inside and two thousand outside.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The price of the land was about one hundred thousand dollars, and the price to build the meeting hall was about the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was bearing the responsibility in these financial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day Brother Nee's wife told me that he wanted me to go to his home that night.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I went to his home, he handed over to me thirty-seven gold bars at ten ounces each.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was three hundred seventy ounces of gold at fifty dollars an ounce at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said, "Take this and use it for the payment of the land."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He told me he got it from the pharmaceutical business.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the revival brought in through the return of Brother Nee to his ministry, he began to have a training.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later the Communists took over his training center.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was arrested in 1952 and was imprisoned until his death twenty years later.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to my view and knowledge of Brother Nee, he did not have much peace in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He suffered his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was really a suffering person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In all his sufferings, he learned to deal with his natural life and self.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The last lesson he learned through being put aside from the ministry for six years was the breaking of the outer man and the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He learned this one lesson in those six years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During this time he would not minister because so many were rebellious toward him, but some of us had many times of fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He always talked to us about the breaking of our outer man and the release of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those six years of suffering helped him to learn the lesson of having the natural man broken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the natural man is broken, the release of the spirit is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not merely pass on teaching and doctrines to people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All of his teaching had the backing of real experience learned through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was not just a Bible student, who learned doctrines and passed them on to others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever he ministered, he himself experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He learned so much through all his sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today we are the ones who inherit all the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The sufferings I saw with Brother Nee and the lessons he learned through them helped my life very much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can never forget what I saw in him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the impressions I received of him became the greatest help to my Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is also a great help to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today we have such a heritage, which was built up by one who paid such a great price.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The price was the sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brother Nee was a man of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He did not have any children, and his wife went to the Lord about seven or eight months before he died in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There was no need for him to write a will because he had nothing left when he went to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, he left much with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today we have the churches and such a rich heritage.</S>
