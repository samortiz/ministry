<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of a law called the law of the Spirit of life. What is the law of the Spirit of life? It is a spontaneous power, a spontaneous function. When I wave my hand in front of a person&rsquo;s eyes, he spontaneously blinks. When I eat a meal, my stomach and intestines spontaneously digest the food. These are laws involving spontaneous powers and functions; they do not require an effort of our will or our strength to activate them. The law of the Spirit of life is also a spontaneous power and function that comes from the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>The Spirit of life is God&rsquo;s Spirit in our spirit. Since this Spirit is of life, His law must also be of life. Therefore, the law of the Spirit of life is also a law of life. A law does not necessarily have life, but life always has a law with a spontaneous power and function. Whether animal or vegetable, all life has a law and a spontaneous power and function. For example, flying is included in the law of the life of a bird; it is a spontaneous power of life in birds. Bearing fruit is included in the law of the life of a fruit tree; it is a spontaneous power of life in fruit trees. The higher that a life is, the stronger is its law and the greater is its spontaneous power and function. Since we have inwardly received the highest life from the Holy Spirit, it is the highest law, and it has the highest spontaneous power and function. This law, this spontaneous power and function, operates in us through God&rsquo;s Spirit to free us from the law of sin and of death, that is, from everything that is opposed to God. We do not need to make a determination to do something nor do we need to struggle and strive; the law of the Spirit of life operates in us spontaneously to manifest its power and function.</p>
<p>Since the law of the Spirit of life is also a law of life, it is one with the laws written on our hearts. A law that can be written on our hearts is related to life and emphasizes the function of life. Since this law is also the law of the Spirit of life, this law of life comes from the Holy Spirit in our spirit and emphasizes the function of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Operating in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:13).</p>
<p>God is operating in us. This is a marvelous thing! We may know that God is in us, but we may not realize that God is operating in us. God is not in us apart from His work and activity. He is working and constantly operating in us. Regardless of our inward will or outward actions, He is always operating in us, causing us to know and obey His will for the accomplishment of His good pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Now the God of peace...perfect you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 13:20-21).</p>
<p>God is operating in us, doing that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ, causing us to carry out His will. Therefore, His operation in us causes us to know His will and to realize what is well pleasing to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Living in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Christ...lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>Christ being in us is not only for Him to be our life but also for Him to live in us. His living in us means that He is working in us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Christ is in you&rdquo;; &ldquo;Jesus Christ is in you&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:10; 2 Cor. 13:5).</p>
<p>Christ is in us from the moment that we believe. Since we have faith in Christ, Christ is in us and He is living and working. He is not inactive in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Teaching of the Anointing</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27).</p>
<p>The term <em>anointing</em> refers to the moving of the ointment, and in the Bible ointment refers to the Holy Spirit (Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38). Therefore, the anointing is the operation of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit operates in us like the moving of ointment, anointing the Lord&rsquo;s will into our understanding. Thus, the anointing within teaches us concerning all things. Our knowledge of the Lord&rsquo;s requirements, of His leading, of what we should do before Him, and of how we should do it is taught by the moving of the ointment in us. Some brothers sense that the Lord wants them to deal with a certain matter; other brothers sense that the Lord wants them to offer up certain things. Some sisters sense that the Lord is touching their clothing and make-up; other sisters sense that the Lord is sending them to visit certain ones. These senses are anointed into them by the teaching of the anointing, which causes them to know the Lord&rsquo;s will and the Lord&rsquo;s desire. The teaching of the anointing within is very practical and precise.</p>
<p>The preceding six items all refer to matters related to God&rsquo;s life within us, and they speak of how God lives in us according to His life. These six items are connected. They are in accord with each other and are one. The Holy Spirit within us is Christ within us; Christ within us is God within us. The Triune God is living and operating in us to anoint His will into us; He does this through the enlightening of His life, which causes us to know Him and His will and to live in Him and in His will.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 2 &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
