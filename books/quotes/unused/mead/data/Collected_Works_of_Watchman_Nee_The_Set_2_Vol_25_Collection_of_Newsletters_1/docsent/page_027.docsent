   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The place of the conference meetings was still 211-212 Wen-teh Lane, Hardoon Road, Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the building is small, a tent was put up at the front door.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Time of the Conference Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The conference began on January 22 and ended on January 31.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the funeral rites were over, they were quiet during the ten days of the conference.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Condition of the Conference Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every meeting was very crowded.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God brought him through.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Messages</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The messages spoken on the first two days laid a foundation and prepared the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the morning of the twenty-second, the topic was the pursuit of service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the afternoon, the topic was a hidden life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The topic on the morning of the twenty-third was the requirements for spiritual growth, and the topic in the afternoon was prayer to work together with God.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The rest began to leave on February 1.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thank God for releasing His "present truth" in this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank Him that there was fellowship among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We not only gained His "up-to-date" truth; we also gained the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we commit His truth and His children into His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May He bless His truth and may He bless His children!</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A LETTER FROM HSING HUA, FUKIEN PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Peace to Brother Shu:</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I received Collection of Newsletters on the sixth, and I received Notes on Scriptural Messages and The Present Testimony today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There were several brothers who had planned to attend the Overcomer Conference in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Unfortunately, the political situation was very tense, and there was no scheduled direct steamer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They could only go through Amoy or Ma Wei.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, the army was traveling back and forth continually for several days, and many of the cars were sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Consequently, we missed this wonderful opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We were unable to overcome these difficulties and be present in person at this gala event to meet and fellowship with all the brothers and sisters in China under one roof, bending our knees in prayer and speaking our hearts together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What can we say to express our disappointment!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have wired twenty dollars to help with the expenses of this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Ten dollars of that money was the offering collected from the meetings in P'u Ch'eng and Han Chiang, and the rest was from two individual brothers in the above two localities.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Please accept it for your use.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May the Father greatly bless this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May all the brothers and sisters in China be built up and taught by it so that the Lord's Word may spread quickly in these last days.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We fully agree with the suggestions in Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We hope our brother can spare some time to come to Hsing Hua to lead the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is what we hope for most.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We bless you with health to your spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We greet you with a kiss from your brothers,</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Chen Tsai Sheng and Faithful Luk</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>January 10, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>P.S. Please do not forget to greet all the brothers and sisters at the conference for us.</S>
