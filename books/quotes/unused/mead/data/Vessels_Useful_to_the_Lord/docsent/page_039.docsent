   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROBLEM OF CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Timothy 4:12 says, Let no one despise your youth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only are young people often despised because of their youth, but even older people are despised when they act like children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In today s society, those who have successful careers or are given authority over others have a strict character.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A person with a loose character cannot be a manager or director.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even if he is very knowledgeable and capable, no one will dare to hire him as a manager or a director.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he were given a job, he would be unable to accomplish anything and would end up causing disaster.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not think that it is easy to be a manager.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you were asked to be a manager, you probably would not be able to do it for even one day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Your subordinates, as well as your superiors, would push you and put pressure on you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you have a loose character and are unable to bear pressure, eventually you will become seriously ill or at least have stomach ailments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The difficulty in the Lord s work is that there are no examinations or grading systems for the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today every government organization has general and special examinations for their employees, and private companies also have grading systems to assess a person s individual performance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, there is nothing of this sort in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The co-workers do not have to take examinations, nor will they ever be dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Brother Nee was taking the lead among the co-workers in mainland China, he suffered much because of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes he was pressed to the limit and wanted to speak some rebuking words to them, but some of the co-workers could not stand being rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They had no fear, so when they were rebuked, they would get angry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were like hot potatoes that you want to get rid of but cannot and that hurt you when you keep them in your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If those brothers had been working in various professions in the world, they would have been asked to leave and to look for another job.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, we cannot do this in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, we are in a difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope that this would not cause you to consider yourself fortunate to be in the Lord s work and to say within yourself, I am going to join this profession, because once I am in, no one will have control over me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is true that no one will control you, but if you have this kind of intention, you will be finished and will be useless in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is a saying in northern China that says, Once a person becomes a soldier, he is like iron beaten into a nail; once a person becomes a preacher, for his whole life he is spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once iron is beaten into a nail, it has no other use except as a nail.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the eyes of the world, a person who becomes a preacher will eventually be good for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His whole life will be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, our character needs to be under strict control and to be molded all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are careless and become set in a certain mold, we will be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, who will control us while we are doing the Lord s work?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though Timothy was a spiritual son to Paul, the most Paul could do was to write to him in the way of an exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If Timothy received the exhortation, Paul would be comforted, but if he rejected the exhortation, Paul would not be able to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>History proves that Paul was able to get through with Timothy and was unable to get through with other co-workers 2 Tim 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even his letters to them were of no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our hope is to produce two hundred young, full-time serving ones in Taiwan each year.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the Lord fulfills this matter, we will have one thousand full-time serving ones in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although this sounds encouraging, I am concerned that when you young people enter into the Lord s work, you will become one thousand hot potatoes if your character is not trained properly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If this happens, then we will not be able to do the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, I emphasize again and again that besides pursuing the truth and growing in life you must also cultivate a strict character.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you do not pursue the truth or grow in life that much, it is not too great a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may not have a great measure of usefulness, but at least you will still be able to exercise your portion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if you learn the truth and grow very well in life but are not built up in character, then this will become a great problem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The senior co-workers among us are getting old, and in a sense, they cannot do that much anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are some other co-workers, but I would not like to talk about them right now.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, I have a heavy burden concerning you young people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope that you would pay full attention to the matter of your character.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Formerly in China there was a group of people who were known as Bohemians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They did not button their shirts, tie their shoes, or comb their hair.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The only thing that they ever did was to stretch out their hand when tea was brought and open their mouth when food was served.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those people were lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You should not imitate them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, you should learn to be diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A young brother once testified that when he was in the military, he was very disciplined and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He arranged all his personal belongings in a tidy manner, and even his superior praised him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Later, however, after he retired from the military and got married, he needed his wife to help him find his watch, socks, and clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows that a good character had not been built up in him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Recently, after hearing about the importance of character, he was awakened.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He realized that this is a great matter, so he made up his mind to be trained in character and asked his wife not to help him find his daily necessities.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you sisters are serving the Lord and marry this kind of husband, do not help him to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, help him to be trained in his character.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the churches most problems, whether big or small, can be easily solved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The most difficult matter is finding a proper elder to manage the affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The reason it is difficult to find such an elder lies in the matter of character.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, do not despise the training that you are receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After you graduate from the training and go out to labor for the Lord, you must in a sense be like a suicide squad.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who have not built up their character cannot be like those in a suicide squad.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On January 28, 1932, Japan invaded Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At that time a pilot in the Chinese air force piloted his plane into a Japanese aircraft carrier.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This action shook the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The various world powers were fearful of the bravery of the Chinese people and warned Japan not to act rashly and blindly anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This temporarily stopped the Japanese invasion.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>My point in saying this is that your ability to take a certain action altogether hinges on your character.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That young pilot was brave and could sacrifice himself to save the country because he was a person of good character.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If he had not had a good character, he would not have been able to do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today in the Lord s service, those who have a good character and a goal are very much needed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Whether or not we will fulfill the Lord s purpose has much to do with our character in spiritual matters and in the matters of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All parents know that if they want their children to be useful, they must cultivate in them a good character.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If their character is not built up, they will be easily spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Although you have received a certain amount of perfecting and training regarding your character, in order for you to be useful in the Lord s hand and to serve the Lord, you need further training regarding your character.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A person who is loose in his character cannot be three-dimensional and is like a flat, two-dimensional surface.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A two-dimensional person cannot be a vessel and cannot contain anything.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you are not built up in your character, you will be a person who is flat and cannot be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hence, in learning to serve the Lord, the foremost matter is to pay attention to your character.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You cannot be loose in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>For instance, consider your reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You must decide how much to read and then read according to a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You must read even when you are sick or when you are exceedingly busy.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You must carefully evaluate and schedule every aspect of your life and try your best to save your time and energy for your service and spiritual pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Whether or not you will have good fellowship with the Lord, have adequate prayer before the Lord, read the Lord s Word properly, or advance in your usefulness in the Lord s hand will depend on your character.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If your character is loose, none of these things can be built up.</S>
