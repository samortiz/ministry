Although we always have the desire to care for others and love our children relatives friends brothers and sisters we are unable to do it
Since he has been equipped with the knowledge of the subject matter, it is very easy for him to comprehend when he reads it
If our mind does not have the divine concept, regardless of how hard we try in our reading, we cannot receive the divine revelation
The book of Ephesians is filled with many high revelations and profound truths, yet we are unable to take them in
Colossians 2:2 speaks of 'the mystery of God, Christ,' referring first of all to Christ as the mystery of God being in us as our life
Not only does Paul tell us in Colossians that Christ is our life, but he also tells us in Philippians that Christ is our experience of life
You know the characteristics of what God is through the manifestations of all the created things in the universe
Before God became flesh, He was the Word without a bodily form; when He became flesh, He assumed a bodily form
Christ is the mystery of God, the embodiment of God, because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily
It may sound better in Chinese to say that we experience Christ to be our life, but this utterance is not accurate
There is the need for the book of Philippians to go on to tell us how Christ is our life and how we can experience this Christ as our life
In Greek, the expression the Spirit of Jesus Christ means that the Spirit is Jesus Christ; hence, the Spirit of Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ
Similarly, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom'
The first part of the verse says, 'The Lord is the Spirit,' and the latter part says, 'The Spirit of the Lord'
Eventually when he is filled by the Holy Spirit, he is strengthened and empowered to overcome the oppression of afflictions
You see that this brother is not only saved, but even more he has experienced the Spirit in him as his salvation
As long as you are a living person with the power of life within you, the life in you will enable you to extricate your feet from the mud
The life in your body is your salvation; this is not an objective, outward salvation, but rather a subjective, inward salvation
Philippians 1:20 says, 'As always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death'
Although the Lord Jesus as the Spirit indwelling our spirit is abstract, impalpable, and invisible, He is indeed saving us inwardly
We delight in and are accustomed to using our mind to consider, our emotion to love or to hate, and our will to decide
In my early years in my hometown Chefoo there were electric lamps and telephones but only very few people had them installed in their homes
Whenever we came home after dark, we would look for a match to light the kerosene lamp; we did this every day such that it became our habit
He ignored his mind, emotion, and will but cared only for the spirit within him by always opening up to the spirit
We live Christ only when it is time to go to the meetings or when we need to depend on Him in the midst of difficulties
We should not wait to live Christ until we go to the meetings, speak in the meetings, or encounter difficult situations and persecutions
If a Christian waits until he is in a meeting to act like he is living Christ, then that is to have a true, formal, first-class religion
If you do not live Christ in your daily life, yet you try to perform something when you go to the so-called Sunday worship, that is religion
Today the Lord does not want religion; what He wants is for us to live Christ whether in our daily life or in the meetings
The indwelling Spirit with the bountiful supply will save us from the old creation and from the living that is of the old creation
You are our God and our Lord, and yet You became the life-giving Spirit to dwell in us as our life and everything
We can prove His existence from the principles of science, physics, physiology, and all things in the universe
Tens of thousands of Christians can also prove the existence of God from the experiences they have in their daily living
Although God is mysterious and invisible, man cannot say that there is no God just because he does not see Him
No one has seen electricity, and even those who specialize in electricity cannot pinpoint exactly where electricity is
The term electrical waves indicates that there is energy in the air that is transmitted by the phenomenon of waves
Even though we do not understand it, if we tune a radio to the right frequency, the waves in the air will transmit the music to us
The Bible also says that the heart of men is deceitful above all things, wicked to the uttermost, and even incurable
We all know that the physical, biological heart in man is our human heart, but no one knows where the psychological heart is located
As a mystery, God is invisible to our physical eyes; however, through all things in the universe and our experience, we know that God exists
A person may have no lack in food clothing shelter and transportation he may have enjoyed every possible kind of entertainment and amusement
When he lies down to rest in the silence of the night, his deepest part often has a kind of bored and empty feeling
The hole, the void, in the deepest part of men is something that cannot be filled by any person, thing, or matter in the world
Throughout the ages due to the fact that the need within mans spirit cannot be satisfied by anything in the world religion was then invented
Confucianism, which is composed of the teachings of Confucius, teaches people about ethics and morality but not the worship of God
Taoism teaches profound and mysterious thoughts, transcendence from worldliness, and self-cultivation to obtain immortality
Only the Bible tells us that there is a true God in the universe and that He is the Lord the Creator and the sovereign One in the universe
The Old Testament says that Jehovah God is the Creator of all things; moreover, the New Testament says that Jesus Christ is the Lord of all
All men under heaven use the calendar of Jesus Christ as their calendar, so Jesus Christ is the Lord of all men of the world
When you call in this way, you will experience an indescribable joy within, and sometimes you will even be so joyful that you shed tears
Nothing else can satisfy the need in our spirit, nor can anything else quench the thirst in our spirit; only God can
When he is thirsty, you cannot quench his thirst by giving him gold coins or diamonds; only a cup of water can satisfy his need
If man wants to verify the existence of God in the universe, he can do that simply by touching the need in his spirit
If we want to contact God, we must use our spirit because the human spirit is the organ for man to contact God
One day He became flesh to be a man, whose name was Jesus, and lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years
He was crucified on the cross, and by the shedding of His precious blood He accomplished redemption for our sins and became our Redeemer
When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive the Lord Jesus because the Lord's name is just the Lord Himself
The Lord Jesus becomes our life and everything to us in our spirit and thus becomes the real satisfaction within us
When a person believes in Christ and Christ enters into the spirit of this one to be his life and his Savior, he becomes a Christian
A Christ-man is not so simple because within the Christ-man there is Christ and there is also the natural self
There are two persons living together inside every Christ-man: one is the natural self and the other is Christ
Unlike a male and a female who are married to become a couple living together outwardly, these two persons live together within us
Originally, the dress was very lovely, but now you do not even dare look at it, because when you see it, you feel bad within
When we pray, we can touch heaven, and we can also touch the spirit of others, ministering life and life supply to them
The Bible explicitly says that the Lord Jesus, the God-man, has become the life-giving Spirit to dwell in our spirit
Because the Lord Jesus is God, the Spirit has the element of God, and because He is also a man, the Spirit also has the element of man
In the Spirit there are the elements of the effectiveness of His death the power of His resurrection and the glorification in His ascension
As long as we live by this spirit our peculiarities natural man self selfishness and pride will be unknowingly annihilated and destroyed
The Bible tells us that the purpose of God in creating man is for man to contain Him and to express Him by living Him out
After we have been saved, although we have Christ as life within, we are still accustomed to living by ourselves
When listening to the word, many Christians exercise their eyes and ears instead of their spirit, and their mind is full of criticism
Many of us have to wait until such a situation arises before we turn to our spirit and cry, 'O Lord, have mercy on me'
Christ-men not only have the God-created conscience, but all the more they have the Lord of life within them as life
In our daily living, in whatever circumstance, whether through life or through death, even as always Christ will be magnified in our body
If the Spirit within us says, 'No,' we also say, 'No'; if the Spirit within us says, 'Yes,' we then say, 'Amen'
O Lord, we come here not only to hear Your words, but even more to receive Yourself, because Your very self is in Your words
May You give us a comforting word, a solid word, an encouraging word, a healing word, and a life-supplying word
We pray that You would eliminate any lukewarmness or hesitation within us so that our whole heart may incline toward You
Lord, operate more and more among us that, with our spirits uplifted and burning, we may thank You, praise You, and worship You together
The Greek word for Comforter is difficult to translate because it is a very particular word; its anglicized form is paraclete
The word refers to one who is called to your side to wait on you, to take care of you, and to bear all your responsibilities
If you have a legal case, he is the lawyer to help you handle the case and go to court to represent you in the lawsuit
When He was thirty years old, He went out to preach the word, heal the sick, cast out demons, perform signs and wonders, and teach the truth
Parents love their children, yet often they are unable to render any help to their children when their children have problems
After three and a half years, suddenly one day He told His disciples that He was going away from them and was going to Him who sent Him
He could not be with His disciples if they were at the Sea of Galilee in the north while He was in the temple in Jerusalem to the south
The Bible tells us, however, that today Christ is in heaven on the right hand of God but at the same time He also dwells in His believers
In those days the Lord Jesus was with His disciples and He walked, stayed, and lived with them, but He could not enter into them
He had to go and have a change through death and resurrection; in His resurrection He would come back to enter into His disciples
Corinthians 15 says that a grain bears a certain kind of body before it is sown and bears another kind of body after it grows
He appeared to them another time and said to Thomas, 'Bring your finger here and see My hands, and bring your hand and put it into My side'
After the Lord Jesus breathed the Holy Breath into the disciples, and while they were in great amazement and rejoicing, He disappeared again
When He breathed into the disciples, He breathed the Spirit into them; this means that He breathed Himself into them
From that time onward, the disciples had a treasure abiding in them, a treasure that would never leave them again
As soon as the morning broke, the Lord stood on the shore and said to them, 'You do not have any fish to eat, do you'?
Before we were saved, we did not have the Spirit of reality, but after we have been saved, we have Him abiding in us
After you have been saved, because the Spirit of reality dwells in you, sometimes when you want to buy something, He would not agree
Sometimes we have been wronged, but we do not complain; other times we have been rebuked, but we are not angry
John 14 speaks about the matter of mutual abiding in one way, while John 15 goes further and speaks about it in another way
In Greek the word for make home is different from the word for dwells in Romans 8 and from the word for abide in John 14 and 15
The word for dwells in Romans is the verb form of the word for house; it means to inhabit as one's abode and is a stronger word than abide
Christ not only dwells in us but also makes home in us, and He even settles down in us by being deeply rooted in our heart
In Adam, all we had were the fall, sin, darkness, and death; in Christ, we have transcendence, victory, light, and life
When we believe in the Lord Jesus, we move out of Adam into Christ; we no longer dwell in the old Adam but in Christ
From the Bible we can see that the Lord Jesus became the salvation of those who believe in Him through ten great steps
In order to accomplish redemption, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin, possessing both divinity and humanity
After living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, He delivered Himself to the place of death and was crucified
His death is all-inclusive, not only redeeming us from our sins but also terminating all things of the old creation
In His incarnation He brought God into man; in His crucifixion He dealt with man's sins; in His resurrection He brought man into God
At this point, we all have to shout with rejoicing because Christ is not only our Savior but also the glorious indwelling Christ
As the King of kings and the Lord of lords, He has received authority and has been crowned with glory and honor
At His coming again, the Lord Jesus will set up His kingdom on the earth to reign over the earth for a thousand years
After the Second World War the United Nations was formed, yet the more the whole world tries to be united, the more divided it becomes
Today the key point, the most important point, in our enjoyment of Christ's salvation is the indwelling Christ
On the one hand, He is in heaven interceding for us as our great High Priest, our Advocate, to carry out God's economy
On the other hand, He is the all-inclusive indwelling Christ who dwells in us as our Comforter to be our life and all of our supply
We were not only created according to the image of Christ, but we were also created as vessels instead of instruments
Knives, axes, and saws are instruments for working, whereas glasses and tea cups are vessels for containing something
Corinthians 4:6 says, 'The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts'
When the shutter is open, the image of the beautiful scene with beautiful flowers is exposed on the film through the entrance of light
After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus became the life-giving Spirit to dwell in the spirit of those who believe in Him
Timothy 422 says The Lord be with your spirit and Romans 816 says The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God
These verses show us that the Spirit is in our spirit and is mingled with our spirit so that the two spirits have become one
We have said that when God created us, He created us according to the image of Christ that we may contain Christ
Paul said to the believers in the church in Philippi, 'Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus'
In order to be meek, we must have meekness inwardly as our nature and then we must manifest it outwardly as our character
Smoothness is not something of our nature or our character, because it does not require the functions of our mind, emotion, and will
Meekness not only comes out of our mind, emotion, and will, but it also comes out of our conscience and spirit
It comes out of what you are, that is, your inner person; it also comes out of what you do, that is, your personality manifested outwardly
According to our experience, Christ's making His home in our hearts requires a long period of time and process
A person may have already believed in the Lord for quite a period of time and Christ has been in him in quite a deep way
Christ is like the hand that has entered into the glove but has not been able to extend the fingers into the proper places
Such a one still needs a period of time to enjoy Christ continually and have the fellowship of life with the brothers and sisters
Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul-mind, emotion, and will-plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit
He is waiting within us for us to love Him and cooperate with Him, and He is also waiting for us to know Him and take Him as life
If we love Him and cooperate with Him, we afford Him the opportunity to come into our mind to become its content
Before Christ enters into your emotion whatever you love you love according to your own preference and not according to Christs preference
Our experience tells us that when we are filled with Him, He is real and living and can freely make His home in our mind, emotion, and will
In this way we are completely and practically joined to Him as one, and it is at this stage that we are truly Christ-men
The entire Bible tells us a wonderful and mysterious thing, that is, that the Triune God desires to work Himself into His believers
Although this picture is not the real me, it can somewhat show them my outward appearance because it is my picture
On the one hand, the Bible says that God created man in His image, but on the other hand, it says that God is invisible
The conventional ethics that we profess are included in these four items of what God is-love, light, holiness, and righteousness
Throughout the ages in all lands among all peoples whether barbaric or civilized anyone who steals will have a sense of shame and darkness
Sometimes we may provoke our parents to anger, but when we calm down, we have a genuine sense that we have wronged them
As another example, a husband may have an exchange of words with the wife in the morning, but by the evening he feels sorry for his behavior
He was conceived in the womb of a virgin through the Holy Spirit and was born to be a man, whose name was Jesus
With His face set like a flint, He went boldly to Jerusalem and went to the cross to shed His blood and die on our behalf
The stories in the Gospels are so marvelous and the words are so mysterious; indeed, they cannot be the speaking of men
The Lord Jesus is not an ordinary historical character; He is God incarnated to be a man, and all that God is dwells in Him
The Lord Jesus is the embodiment of all these four items in all that He was and all that He did, in every word and in every action
These eight items are far superior to the principles of propriety, justice, honesty, and sense of shame taught by the Chinese philosophers
In 4:9 Paul went on to say, 'The things which you have also learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things'
When the young people read these eight items, the more they read, the more they will realize that they cannot do these things
He 'who empowers me' is Christ, who is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ with a bountiful supply, as mentioned in Philippians 1:19
Christ is like the electricity; He is the One who empowers us just as the electricity empowers the electrical appliances
When you open up your heart and receive Him as your Savior, He comes into you and dwells in you to be your life and everything
In the beginning we were created in His image so we also have a mind emotion and will as well as love light holiness and righteousness
The life-giving Spirit is the Lord Jesus with His mind, emotion, and will and the God who is love, light, holiness, and righteousness
We also take the Lord's love, light, holiness, and righteousness as our love, light, holiness, and righteousness
Even the more, He wants to be in you that which is true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, well spoken of, virtuous, and praiseworthy
It is very difficult to express these virtues by ourselves and even if we were able to the expression would be neither complete nor perfect
Originally, these two trees have two distinct and different lives, but after the grafting process, the two become one
The new fruit, which is the result of the mingling of two lives, is no longer sour and ugly but sweet and beautiful
We need to realize that our old man must be terminated and put to death, so that Christ can grow in us and be magnified through us
Since Paul and the Lord Jesus were completely joined as one, the bowels of the Lord Jesus became the bowels of Paul
In the phrase if any fellowship of spirit, spirit refers not to the Holy Spirit but to the regenerated human spirit
Formerly, Paul had been zealous for the law to the extent that he persecuted the Christians, but he turned from the law of Moses to Christ
He no longer had the righteousness which was out of the law, but he had the righteousness which was through faith in Christ
Philippians 4:8-9 lists six precious virtues: truthfulness, dignity, righteousness, purity, loveliness, and being well spoken of
The Bible tells us that man is a special creation of God, different from the trees and flowers and from the oxen and sheep
The life of God within man is just God Himself, and the living out of God is the expression of the life within
Unfortunately, not only do the unbelievers not understand this, but even many Christians do not know this truth
God's image refers to all these attributes and virtues, and it is according to such an image that God created man
The third commandment is to not take the name of Jehovah God in vain, that is, to not use His name in vain in things other than God Himself
Immediately after man was created, he began to enjoy the rest established by God; that is, he began to enjoy all of God's creation
Some people may be able to fulfill the first nine commandments, but the last one is the most difficult to fulfill
Our ethics and morality are higher and more real because they are not our own work but the living out of Christ in our human virtues
According to the revelation in the Bible, God went through four steps to enable man to live out Christ in human virtues
They think that since the Lord Jesus lived out the likeness of God, He is qualified to be our pattern and we should imitate Him
When we receive this pneumatic Christ, He enters into us to be our life and lives out the image of God from within us
Since the Lord Jesus lives in us, He uplifts our love toward others, causing us to love them in a more real and sincere way
In this way children will surely honor their parents, husbands will surely love their wives, and wives will surely submit to their husbands
You will conduct yourself in a way that is upright, true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of
We do not have to depend on our own strength to keep the law and work out the righteousness which is out of the law
If we allow Him to live out through us, then what is lived out is not our own righteousness but the righteousness of Christ
These precious words involve two aspects; the first aspect concerns us and the second aspect concerns the Lord
Another example, the verse concerning taking the mind of Jesus Christ as our mind , also joins Christ Jesus and us together
To understand this statement, we have to understand the entire book of Philippians because this statement is a summary of the entire book
Ephesians 4:23 and Colossians 3:10 clearly say that we need to be transformed and renewed into the image of the Lord
The picture of a person is not the reality of the person or the person himself; it is merely the image of a person
God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness; we also have the essence of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
The four Gospels in the New Testament are biographies of the Lord Jesus as the records of His life on the earth
He was not merely a portrait or picture of God's image; rather, He was actually a man who lived out God Himself
He did not have the righteousness which was out of the law but that which was through faith in Christ the righteousness which was out of God
Through faith in Christ we have been joined to Christ, and another kind of righteousness is manifested through us
It is the issue of our being joined to Christ through faith and of Christ's being one with us and living Himself out through us
We can attain to this level because the resurrected Christ is in us empowering us with the power of resurrection
Because Christ is the expression of God, when Christ is lived out through us, divinity is expressed through humanity
As the Christ who died and resurrected and as the all-inclusive Spirit, He lives in us as our life to express His image through us
All virtues expressed in human conduct, religious philosophy, human ethics, laws, and rituals cannot compare with this
The apostle Paul lived out this kind of life, and he also hoped that every Christian also will live this kind of life
In the previous chapters we saw how to experience Christ as our life and how to live out Christ in our human virtues
These virtues are not the result of our own work but the issue of our experience of the Triune God as our life
You do not like to do evil, to cheat, or to act craftily; rather, you desire your conduct to be upright and full of righteousness
If you carefully study the Ten Commandments you will realize that the essence of the commandments is love light holiness and righteousness
Because God Himself is love light holiness and righteousness the law that He made is the expression of love light holiness and righteousness
In the four Gospels we see that the life which Christ lived on earth may be represented by four words love light holiness and righteousness
Since God is love light holiness and righteousness when He enters into us it is love light holiness and righteousness entering into us
Even though we have a little measure of love, light, holiness, and righteousness within us, it is distorted and deficient
Within us Christians, not only do we have God and Christ, but we also have the human virtues that correspond to the law
We must be clear that we are not speaking about the moral principles in human relationships commonly taught among the Chinese people
The morality that we work out is at best that which Paul referred to as 'the righteousness which is out of the law' in Philippians 3
If you carefully analyze these six items, you can categorize them under four big items: love, light, holiness, and righteousness
Several times in the Chinese Union Version this word is rendered 'moral act,' implying something powerful and manifesting brightness
Although we had love, light, holiness, and righteousness in our humanity, they were empty because there was no real content
God has enriched and magnified the virtues, which include love, light, holiness, and righteousness, in our humanity with His divinity
Christ, the second among the Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is now the resurrected Christ with the power of resurrection
In the book of Philippians we clearly see that first there is the Father, second there is the Son, and third there is the Spirit
The title of the Divine Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit-was not clearly disclosed before the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
In other words, God is triune, but it was not until after the Lord Jesus resurrected that the Triune God was consummated in the Spirit
We have said that the book of Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ; it speaks about living out Christ in our daily life
The phrase the Spirit of Jesus Christ shows us that Jesus Christ is the Spirit and that the Spirit is Jesus Christ Himself
When we experience Christ, we experience Him as the Spirit, because Christ can be in us only by being the Spirit
The word empowers here and the word power in Ephesians 1:19 come from the same Greek word for dynamic or dynamo
Regardless of whether it is great power, or strength, or power, we have it because we have Christ in us as the driving force
If the switch is not turned on, the dog cannot move, but when the switch is turned on, the dog begins jumping around
Once the resurrection power begins to operate in us, it enables us to break through death and transcend everything
Philippians 2:13 says, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
Our body needs to be satisfied with the outward physical things, such as food, clothing, shelter, and transportation
Within the body is the soul, which belongs to the psychological realm, and within the soul is the spirit, which is the innermost part of man
Human history throughout the ages contains records of the worship of God both among the barbaric nations and civilized societies
There are inferior religions and there are also superior religions; there are backward religions and there are also advanced religions
Some people have fully satisfied their need for food clothing shelter and transportation however they still have their psychological needs
After they have met their psychological needs, they are still not satisfied because they still have a spirit within them that has its need
In brief, religion presents God for people to worship and exhorts them to do good according to the God whom they worship
When they read the Bible, they consider the Bible to be a book that presents an object for worship and teaches people to do good
In order for man to attain to this purpose, God must enter into man to become man's life so that man may live out God
Because Christianity has become a religion, our attitude should be that we care only for Christ and not for Christianity
They may wonder how we can say that we do not want worship meetings, traditions, or rituals and that we only want Christ
Indeed, this is very difficult to comprehend, but we still declare that we only preach Christ; we do not preach Christianity
It has been proven by science by your heart and by the need which is in your spirit that there is one unique sovereign Lord in the universe
Whenever we stop the activities of our body and our soul, allow the Spirit to work in us, and call from our spirit, 'O God!
O Lord Jesus,' then, instead of being in our outward activities, we remain in our spirit, the innermost part of our being
We have a spirit in us, and God wants us to use our spirit to contact Him, and not only to contact Him but to receive Him
She had sinned and had changed husbands five times, and even the one whom she had at the time was not her husband
We must be in spirit and receive Christ as truthfulness; only then can our worship of God be true, real, and not empty
Not only are the Gentile religions futile, but even Judaism and Christianity, including Catholicism, are useless
The Bible shows us that God is our food, our living water, and our spiritual breath; all these are for our enjoyment
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit as the Three in One are not for our doctrinal understanding of theology but for our enjoyment
The Brethren teachers said that the heavenly Father is in heaven the Son is sitting beside the heavenly Father and the Spirit is sent to us
God the Son came to be among mankind through incarnation and accomplished the great work of God's redemption by His death on the cross
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was with the disciples for three and a half years, and the disciples enjoyed His presence
We need to enjoy the Triune God, and we need the subjective salvation of the Triune God; we do not need religion
Now we want to see the way to enjoy the subjective salvation of the Triune God through the verses in the book of Philippians
These verses cover three main points: first concerning the Spirit, second concerning Christ, and third concerning God
The Bible is the clear word with black letters printed on white paper; the Holy Spirit is the living reality in our spirit
What we preach is the content of the gospel, and the Holy Spirit has a bountiful supply, which is also the content of the gospel
Although you have believed in the Lord Jesus, you are not in Him but rather in your mind, in your thoughts, and in your flesh
Philippians 2:13 says, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
The willing takes place in our will, indicating that God's operation begins from our spirit and spreads into our mind, emotion, and will
Today, God is the life-giving Spirit with a bountiful supply, and He wants to enter into you to operate in you
Philippians 46 says In nothing be anxious but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God
Prayer is general, having worship and fellowship as its essence; petition is special, being for particular needs
To pray with thanksgiving means that although your request has not yet been answered, you believe that you have already received it
If you are not in Him, even if He has the bountiful supply and the resurrection power, they cannot be your enjoyment
In other words, we need to submit to His moving within us, and we also need to pray and petition with thanksgiving
Do not wait until a prayer time to have this enjoyment; you need to maintain a prayerful spirit the entire day
