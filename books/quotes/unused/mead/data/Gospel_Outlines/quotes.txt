[19]  It is not easy to give a clear picture of salvation by using the story of Cain and Abel in Genesis 4 as a gospel subject, because the main points are usually missed.
[20]  However, if you use Man s Religion and God s Saving Way as the subject for this portion, it will be easy for you to speak, because the story of Cain speaks of man s religion, and that of Abel speaks of God s saving way.
[21]  Subject Eighteen THE WAY TO ESCAPE DEATH Scripture: Gen 5; John 11:25, 26 Sin is the source of death No one will escape death, because no one is sinless.

[42]  On God s side there is light, good, heaven, life, etc. On Satan s side there is darkness, evil, hell, death, etc. Because of the two sides or two sources in the universe, man has two possible choices: he may choose to follow God, which means to choose light, a good life, and heaven; or he may choose to follow Satan, which means to choose darkness, evil, death, and hell.

[94]  The following points are concerning the selection of materials for gospel preaching: When you choose this passage for a gospel message, never emphasize that this is a case of a paralyzed man being healed, because people might misunderstand that this is just a sickness that was healed and not realize that it is a matter of a soul being saved.
[95]  Do not go to the book of Matthew to find a story of healing for preaching the gospel, because that book shows us that the Lord Jesus is the King expressing authority, rather than one ministering to man.
[96]  Subject Seventy JESUS CAME NOT TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS Scripture: Mark 2:13-18 Jesus came to the seashore Man s life is on the seashore.
[97]  The sea is not a good thing; rather, the sea is the depth of sins.

[133]  Subject Ninety-eight THE LAMB OF GOD Scripture: John 1:29, 36 The meaning of the lamb We have to see this from the type revealed in the Old Testament.
[134]  We see in the Old Testament that when Adam sinned, he should have died.
[135]  This shows us that when man sinned, he should have died, but God used the lamb to be the substitute for man, to shed its blood for the sins of man; thus the lamb became the clothing for man to cover himself before God.

[145]  When he was sick, the Lord would not come to heal him.
[146]  This is to say that if a man only admits that he has some problems but will not admit that he is dead, the Lord will not come to save him, because the Lord s salvation is not to heal but to cause the dead to resurrect.
[147]  In this section we should prove the existence of God.
