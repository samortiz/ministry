 <h2 class="head3">Subject One Hundred Thirty-four</h2>
<h1 class="title">AN UNKNOWN GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 17:22-29</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The God who created the universe
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The universe came into being by the creation of God.</li>
	<li>This God, unknown to man, is the God who created the universe.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord of heaven and earth
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The universe was created by God and hence belongs to God. Therefore it says that He is the Lord of heaven and earth. The Lord means the ruler.</li>
	<li>He is the Lord of the universe, and the administrator as well. We need to know God both through the creation and through the administration of the universe.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The source of mankind
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This God is the creator not only of the universe, but also of mankind. The Scripture says, &ldquo;...He Himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; and He made of one every nation of men...&rdquo; This word tells us that He is the creator of mankind and also is the source of mankind.</li>
	<li>Man is not only from Him, but is also taken care of and fed by Him. The human life is given by Him, and human existence is sustained by Him. Man came out of Him and depends upon Him. He is the source of all mankind. Without Him man could never have come into being, neither could there be any human living. Verse 28 says, &ldquo;For in Him we live, and move and have our being...&lsquo;For we are also His offspring.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s ruling of man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This passage of the Scripture says that man came out of God and depends upon God. Man is ruled and controlled by God. After He created him, God put man on the earth and appointed the times and bounds of his habitation. Every man is ruled and appointed by God in time and space. Even the time and place of your birth are not decided by you; they are appointed by God. When someone decides to get married, he may choose the date. But may I ask you a question? Did you choose the time and place of your birth? Whether you are born in China or in the United States, in a wealthy family or in a poor family, none of this is up to you.</li>
	<li>Since God rules over our time and space, not one thing related to us is outside of His ruling.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God can be found
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man always thinks that God is too mysterious, too far away from us, and that He cannot be found or apprehended. On the contrary, God can be found. We are able to realize something of God by the creation of this universe, the existence of all the things, and even by the existence of human life itself. Therefore the Scripture says, &ldquo;For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, being apprehended by the things made, are clearly seen...&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Since we can apprehend God, then knowing God is not only a matter of outward perceiving, but also of inward reasoning. To apprehend is to think and to reason within ourselves. It involves psychological functioning. Therefore, we know God through creation outwardly and through our psychological apprehension within. When we look at nature without, we cannot help but admit the existence of God. When we turn to our heart within, we know clearly that God exists. Therefore, God can be found!</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What should you do with God?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we think of God, naturally we would want to worship Him. This desire to worship God is in our blood. In every human race, there is such a concept. Human beings try to worship God&mdash;even though many worship the wrong god&mdash;for worshipping God is a natural instinct in man.</li>
	<li>Do not worship idols as if they were God; neither worship God as if God were an idol. We are made by God, therefore we should not make God an idol. All the idols of gold, silver, wood, or stone are made by man, so how can we worship these idols?</li>
	<li>Confess that you are far away from God. Repent and turn back to God.</li>
	<li>Receive Jesus as your Savior.</li>
	<li>Worship God in spirit after receiving the Lord.</li>
	</ol></li>
