In the entire New Testament, only one verse tells us of the function of the holy Scriptures, and that is 2 Timothy 3:16. This verse first mentions "teaching," which should be translated "doctrine"; then it stresses the aspect of morality: for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.</P><P>Matthew 13 is truly rich and cannot be exhausted in our entire lifetime. However, it is not for morality but for teaching. Doctrinally, this chapter occupies the greatest position; its subject is the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. The word "mystery" is used a number of times in the New Testament (some have said there are seven mysteries, but this cannot be determined accurately). All the mysteries are equal, except one, which is seen from another standpoint. The mysteries in the Bible cannot be understood by man's natural mentality; they are revealed and made known to men by the Spirit of God. Hence, they are called mysteries. Among God's manifold mysteries there are the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. Other mysteries are found in Ephesians 1:9-10; 3:4-6; 5:32; Colossians 1:27; 1 Corinthians 15:51; 2:7; Revelation 17:5; Romans 16:25; and 1 Timothy 3:16. All the chief mysteries in the entire New Testament are found in these verses.</P><P>The mysteries that remain must take place according to their predetermined time, between the Lord's first coming and His second coming. They cannot occur before or after this period. By this we see that the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens take place in this age and have nothing to do with the coming age.</P><P>From verse 35 of this chapter we can see that the mysteries that take place today were not evident in the Old Testament.</P><P>Verse 1:"On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea." "That day" is the day that the Lord broke His relationship with the Jews. A "house" implies that it belongs to someone; it has a boundary and is a place of calmness. The sea does not belong to anyone, is without limit, and is stormy. That the Lord went out of the house proves that God has come out of that which has a boundary and a limitation into that which is unlimited. The evil men are like the stormy sea, while the house is a quiet and orderly place. (This refers to the conduct of the Pharisees.) The Lord departed from the moral sphere. This means that He forsook the Jews and went to the Gentiles. In the Bible the sea signifies the Gentiles, and the earth signifies the Jews (Rev. 13:1, 11; Dan. 7:3).</P><P>Verse 2:"And great crowds were gathered to Him, so that He stepped into a boat and sat, and all the crowd stood on the shore." The Lord went out of the house, but He did not go into the sea. He sat in a boat. The boat, which was in the sea but not of the sea, signifies the church, which is in the world but not of the world.</P><P>The Lord left the Jews and went to the Gentiles. Nevertheless, He did not go to all the Gentiles; He went only to the Gentiles who were in the boat and spoke there (in the church). Why did the Lord need to speak in parables? Verse 11 of this chapter points out clearly that the things of the kingdom are for His disciples to know and not for the outsiders to understand. The disciples understood by faith. Therefore, to them more was given so that they would abound. But from those who do not have (referring to the Jews), even that which they have (i.e., the miracles and wonders which were done by the Lord among them and which they saw) will be taken away from them. From then on the Lord performed no more miracles. He spoke to them in parables because they could neither see nor hear. Their eyes and their ears had problems because their heart had a problem first. Their heart had become fat, and they rejected the Lord, so there was no way for them to be saved (2 Thes. 2:10-12). By this we know that all the parables in the Bible are spoken to the disciples and not to the Jews. This is a principle.</P><P>The phrase "the kingdom of the heavens has become like," or "the kingdom of the heavens is like," is used six times in this chapter. There are seven parables in this chapter, and if the one on the treasure of things new and old is included, there are eight parables. However, the first parable does not say "the kingdom of the heavens has become like" or "the kingdom of the heavens is like." Three parables were spoken in the house specifically to the disciples; three parables were spoken at the seashore where both the Jews and the disciples were present. Whenever the Bible mentions the numbers three, seven, ten, and twelve, they signify completion. The number three is the number of God. Seven is completeness in time (which is temporary). Ten is human completeness. Twelve is eternal completeness; it is a number signifying the relationship between God and men. Although the parables in Matthew 13 apparently do not have positive significance, there is a line of progression going toward God. In contrast, the condition of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation 2 and 3 is not so; it is a line of degradation.</P><P>A very important principle in studying the Bible is that the release of the truths in the Bible has dispensational restrictions. Therefore, we need to be humbled under God's mighty hand (1 Pet. 5:6), and when we have a specific need, God will give us the light.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 42</div><br></body></html>
