   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE BABYLON AND ITS DESTRUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 17:1 20:6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 17:1 19:4 should be considered as one chapter rather than three separate chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 18:1-3 is the continuation and development of earlier verses since 18:3 speaks of three matters: 1 "All the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication," which is mentioned only in chapter seventeen 17:2 ; 2 "And the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury," which is mentioned only in chapter eighteen 18:11-15 ; and 3 "And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her," which is mentioned in both chapters seventeen and eighteen 17:2; 18:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 16:19 speaks of the great city, Babylon, while 14:8 speaks of Babylon the Great.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If these were the only references to Babylon, without chapters seventeen and eighteen, there would be no way to know clearly what they mean.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapters seventeen and eighteen, there are two Babylons: one is Babylon the Great, and the other is the great city, Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word Babylon is from the word Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Genesis 10 11, Babel was a city in Shinar built by Nimrod, a man who relied on his own strength to protect himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 11:1-4 records the beginning of the tower of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because God confounded their language and scattered the people abroad, the name of the city was called Babel v. 9 . Babel, or Babylon, means confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Babel was also a place of idol worship which is contrary to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This city became greater and greater and reached its climax during the time of Nebuchadnezzar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time, because the Israelites rebelled against God, God delivered them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was at the time of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day Nebuchadnezzar had a dream, and through Daniel's interpretation, he was helped to understand the dream.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this dream the golden head of the great image signifies Babylon at its height.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later, Media and Persia the silver arms destroyed Babylon, and the city became desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Following this, Greece the bronze abdomen destroyed the empires of Media and Persia.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the Roman Empire the iron legs destroyed the empire of Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Babylon was the first kingdom, and the Roman Empire, the last.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All four of these kingdoms persecuted the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of the first three nations have passed, but the influence of the Roman Empire remains to this day, although the ten toes have not yet appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the Jews are still under the rule of the Roman Empire because England is still part of the Roman Empire .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Babylon worshipped idols intensely and hated the Jews to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Roman Empire was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rome was not only a political city but also a center of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the beginning of the church age, Rome had the greatest number of Christians, yet Rome hated the Christians the most.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the fourth century, Constantine embraced Christianity, encouraging and rewarding his people to join it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time he accepted Christianity as the state religion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was also at that time that the center of politics shifted from Rome to Constantinople.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rome remained under the reign of Constantinople until A.D. 700.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, at a conference held by Leo III in Constantinople A.D. 725 , it was decided that worshipping idols was heretical and, therefore, illegal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rome opposed this decision and separated herself from Constantinople.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since that time, the church was divided into the eastern Roman religion the Greek Orthodox Church and the western Roman religion today's Roman Catholic Church .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Eastern Church gradually became weaker, while the Roman Catholic Church grew more prosperous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later, because the Roman Catholic Church was in power, many faithful Christians who loved the Lord were killed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Revelation 17 and 18 indicate that the Roman Church will prosper beyond anything that has ever been recorded, and her power will be exceedingly great.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Antichrist comes, he will set up his own image for the people to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, Antichrist and the ten kings with him will dispose of the Roman Church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, even after the religious Rome is terminated, the political Roman Empire will still exist, having the Mediterranean Sea as its center.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the three and a half years of the great tribulation, God will destroy the political Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why is it that chapters seventeen and eighteen do not refer to Rome directly, but rather mention Babylon?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is because John was living under the reign of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If he had referred to Rome directly, this book could not have been published.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This does not mean that John was afraid to write in an open way, but that the Holy Spirit intended to keep it hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, the Holy Spirit, so that people might not mistakenly consider Babylon as the historical Babylon, says in Revelation 17:5, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, the word "mystery" indicates that this must be interpreted spiritually rather than literally.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, if in Revelation 11:8, Jerusalem had been clearly spelled out, this book would have been opposed by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, it was written with spiritual implications.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Second, John did not say Babylon but "Babylon the Great," indicating that this Babylon must be much greater than the physical, historical Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we read these chapters in this way, we realize that Babylon here is not the ancient Babylon, but Rome.</S>
