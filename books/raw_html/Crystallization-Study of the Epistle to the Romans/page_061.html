 <h2 class="head1">IV. THE TWO STATUSES OF CHRIST&rsquo;S SONSHIP</h2>
<p>Christ as the Son of God has two statuses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Only Begotten Son of God</h2>
<p>Christ is the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18), possessing the divine nature, divinity, from eternity to eternity (Psa. 90:2; Rom. 9:5) as the Second in the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Firstborn Son of God</h2>
<p>Christ is also the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29), possessing both the divine nature and the human nature&mdash;divinity and humanity&mdash;from His resurrection through His ascension and His second coming to eternity. He is the firstborn Son of God beginning from and not earlier than His resurrection (Acts 13:33). The firstborn Son of God had not come into being before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>In Matthew 26:64 the high priest asked the Lord Jesus if He was the Son of God, but He answered with &ldquo;the Son of Man.&rdquo; He said that when He comes back, He will be the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven. From the time of His resurrection, all of Christ&rsquo;s activity is not as the only begotten Son of God, but as the firstborn Son of God in both His divinity and humanity. So in Christ&rsquo;s ascension He is still the Son of Man. Both Stephen and the apostle John saw this (Acts 7:55-56; Rev. 1:13). In His first coming He was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son. In His second coming He will be the Firstborn (Heb. 1:6). For eternity He will be the Son of Man (John 1:51 and note 3).</p>
<p>Many Christians do not realize this deeper truth. They would agree that Christ is both God and man, but they might feel that Christ was no longer a man after His resurrection and ascension. Unconsciously, they may think that Christ was a man only for the thirty-three and a half years from His incarnation to His resurrection.</p>
<p>Joseph from Arimathea took the body of Jesus and he and Nicodemus bound it in linen cloths and laid it in a new tomb (John 19:38-42). On the morning of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, Peter and John saw the linen cloths lying there in the tomb and the handkerchief which had been over His head folded up in one place apart (20:5-7). Christ&rsquo;s body was gone because His body had been resurrected by being transformed from His humanity into His divinity. If you say Christ was a man only for thirty-three and a half years, then I would ask, &ldquo;Where is His body today?&rdquo; The Bible tells us that when He resurrected, He left only the linen cloths and the handkerchief in the tomb. He did not leave His body there. His body was resurrected by being transformed from His humanity into His divinity, and that transformation was God&rsquo;s begetting. God begot Him in resurrection.</p>
<p>All these are the deep details in the Bible. After this fellowship, I hope that you will be made very clear. Christ&rsquo;s humanity was put on in His incarnation, but this humanity was transformed, begotten by God, from His humanity into His divinity in resurrection. So today He is still the Son of Man, not in the original human form, but in the transformed, divine form. In resurrection we were regenerated with Him, but we were not transformed with Him. When He comes, He will transform, or transfigure, our body into His glorious body. Christ is the firstborn Son of God among the many sons of God, His many brothers, who are God&rsquo;s many sons (Rom. 8:29, 19; Heb. 2:10-12).</p>
<p><em>Question: At what point did Christ&rsquo;s divinity become mingledwith His humanity? Was it in incarnation or resurrection?</em></p>
<p>Answer: From incarnation to resurrection Christ was God and man, and this man and God were one. But at that time the mingling had not been consummated. The mingling was consummated by resurrection. Before resurrection His humanity was not brought into His divinity. The mingling of God with man was completed by resurrection.</p>
