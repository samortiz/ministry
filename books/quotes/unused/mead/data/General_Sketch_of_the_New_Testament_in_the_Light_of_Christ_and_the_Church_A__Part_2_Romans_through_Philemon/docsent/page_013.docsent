   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Secret of Setting Our Mind on the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Satan dwells in the members of our body, but God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This brings us to Romans 8:6.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse contains a real secret.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse there are three things: the mind, the flesh, and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have studied many translations of this verse, and this is the one that is the most correct according to the meaning of the original Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The translations in the New American Standard Bible and the Revised Standard Version are also good and convey the same meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this verse we again see the three parties.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We human beings are represented by the mind, and Satan, the evil one, is in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The spirit here is the mingling of two spirits the divine Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is rather difficult to tell whether spirit in Romans 8 is the Holy Spirit or the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 6 it refers to the two spirits mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This can be proved by verse 16 which says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, in the spirit there is God, the divine One, in the mind there is man, and in the flesh there is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now our experience depends on whom or what we would set ourselves, that is, our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we set our mind on the flesh, that is, on Satan, the issue is death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Adam did this when he partook of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, with the same result of death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if we set our mind on God as life, the result is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As Christians today there is no need for us to try to overcome the flesh, and there is no need to try to defeat the law of sin; we cannot do that.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What we need to do is simply stand with the Spirit and rely upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What we need is the deliverance in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must stand with the spirit, set our mind on the spirit, and rely upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we will be delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the secret that we all must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After being a Christian for many years, I believe that no other teachings are so necessary as this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of course, the teachings concerning the Lord Himself, who the Lord is, what the Lord is, and what the Lord has done for us are very necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Subjectively speaking, however, the teaching of Romans 8:6 is the most necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may illustrate this with driving a car.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are many things involved with driving a car, but the most important thing is to be aware of what is immediately around us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we know this, we can drive enjoyably and without effort.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no need to push or pull the car, and there is no need for us to run, walk, or use much energy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We simply can sit there and enjoy our driving, because it is not we who are running, but the car.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we must learn the secret of cooperating with the car.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether or not the car runs depends on us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we have the "car," but we must know how to "drive" it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we know how, there is no problem, and there is no need of our energy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thirty-five years ago I was still struggling, but praise Him, today I have no struggle!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I know that my spirit is my "car," and I know how to "drive" it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today, even a person who is crippled can drive a car, because it is not he who carries the car but the car that carries him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, the car needs him to drive it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same way, it is not we who defeat the enemy; it is the divine life that carries us to gain the victory, but the divine life needs us to "drive" it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The secret is not found even in Romans 6:6 or 6:11; the secret is found in Romans 8:6.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must learn how to set our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, we must learn to trust in God and depend on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we know how to rely on the Lord and trust in Him, and if we do it, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This can be illustrated by the use of electric appliances.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All we have to know is how to plug them in. There is no trouble unless we do not plug them in; in that case, no one can help us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we desire and know how to handle the appliances, then we can plug them in whenever we need them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is simple, yet it is a secret that we all must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I stress these matters because I do not have the burden to give you mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If there is a need for us to learn doctrine, it is solely for the purpose to "drive the car."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our knowledge and understanding of the construction of a car and the arrangement of its parts is for one purpose to drive it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To be familiar with the parts of the car and the operation of the engine helps, but that is not the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The secret is the driving.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Similarly, although we must study the Bible with its narratives and instructions, the real secret is in Romans 8:6.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may be very knowledgeable of the Scriptures, but if we do not apply Romans 8:6, whatever we know and do will accomplish little.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Day and night for many years I have been studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have not found another verse as important as Romans 8:6 as far as our spiritual experience is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The way to "drive" in our spiritual experience is in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now that I have presented many things to you from Romans, beginning from chapter one up to chapter eight, we come to 8:6.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the very place and the secret for us to know how to "drive the car."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Within us there are three wills, three lives, and three laws.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We ourselves are here, Satan is in us, and God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now we must pray, "Lord, help me to choose You.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Help me to rely on You, depend on You, and drop my effort and striving.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Help me never to do anything by myself to overcome evil or temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Rather, help me always to rely on You, stand with You, and trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Lord, I would never do anything to try to correct myself or deliver myself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Lord, help me always to thrust myself upon You, trust in You, and depend on You."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Such an experience of depending on the Lord is sweet and very available.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Its availability may be compared to the electricity in homes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In our homes electricity is so available.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Likewise, we should "plug" into the Lord right away, because He is so available.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Just as electricity is installed in a house, even in the innermost and hidden chambers of the house, the Lord has been installed in our innermost part.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although this divine electricity is so available, there is one thing that is needed: We need to learn the secret and pray that the Lord would give us the willingness to apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We always must be willing to apply it and "plug ourselves in."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although we may listen to hundreds of messages, they may all miss what the real secret of our Christian life is.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have to practice to set our mind on the spirit and to live in this reality all the time.</S>
