Making Them One Spirit with the Lord</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 6:17, the Spirit joins the believers to the Lord, making them one spirit with the Lord. We are one spirit with the Lord by being joined to the Lord. We were joined to the Lord, brought into an organic union with Him, through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine (John 15:4-5). It is a matter not only of life, but in life (the divine life). Such a union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking Together with the Saints</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul said that he gave his opinion (vv. 25, 40). He also said, &ldquo;I charge, not I but the Lord&rdquo; (v. 10), and &ldquo;I say, not the Lord&rdquo; (v. 12). He expressed his opinion in this chapter concerning marriage life. Then he said, &ldquo;But I think I also have the Spirit of God&rdquo; (v. 40). Paul&rsquo;s speaking was the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking. Even when Paul expressed his opinion, the Spirit still spoke. This shows that the Spirit speaks together with the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing with the Believers<br />
That Jesus Is the Lord</h2>
<p>The Spirit confesses with the believers that Jesus is Lord. First Corinthians 12:3 says that &ldquo;no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; When we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; this is not only us calling. We are calling and confessing with the Spirit that Jesus is the Lord. Whenever a person says, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; the Spirit is there with him. This is why we have to charge people to call on the name of the Lord. The Spirit is with whoever calls on the name of the Lord, and that one is saved (Rom. 10:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Distributing Spiritual Gifts to the Believers<br />
and Operating in Them</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12 reveals that the Spirit distributes spiritual gifts to the believers and operates in them (vv. 4, 7-11). The Spirit distributes different gifts to each one of us. Then He operates within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Baptizing the Believers into One Body<br />
and Being a Drink to the Believers</h2>
<p>The believers are first baptized in the Spirit into one Body. Then they drink of the one Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). To baptize is to put someone into water, and to drink is to take in water. This shows that we need the Spirit without and within. The Spirit is the reality of the water in which we are baptized and of the water which we drink.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Person of the Resurrected Christ<br />
to Give Life</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 15:45b the Spirit is the person of the resurrected Christ to give life. In resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit moves, works, and lives in us to impart life into us.</p>
<p>The functions of the Spirit which we have seen thus far show us much concerning the Spirit&rsquo;s capacity. The Spirit&rsquo;s capacity is the capacity of the omnipotent divine life of the Triune God. His capacity is unlimited.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> </body></html>
