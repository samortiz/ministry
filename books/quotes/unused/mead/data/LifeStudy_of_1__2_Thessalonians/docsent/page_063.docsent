   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEAD SAINTS IN PARADISE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some among us may still hold the concept that saints who have died have gone to heaven and are now there with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If Paul had not gone beyond what he says in verse 14, there might be ground for this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in verse 16 Paul says that when the Lord Jesus comes, the dead saints will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Where will they rise up from?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If they are already in heaven, what need will they have to rise up?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And to what place would they rise if they are already in the third heaven with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Christians have been cheated by sugar-coated religious teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One of these teachings says, "Oh, you don't need to weep about your mother who has died.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because she believed in the Lord Jesus, she is now in heaven with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She is in a heavenly mansion, a home that is much better than yours.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why, then, should you weep?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One day you will join her in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of teaching is full of leaven and is very deceitful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have studied the Bible for more than fifty years, and I have not found even one verse that teaches such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a superstition that has its source in paganism, or in Buddhism, and was adopted by Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the Bible, the dead believers are in Paradise Luke 23:43 , the comfortable section of Hades Luke 16:22, 25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Hades, there are two sections: a section of comfort and a section of torment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The section of suffering is different from the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The unpleasant part of Hades may be compared to a jail in contrast to a prison.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A jail is a place where criminals are held temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But after a criminal has been tried and judged, he is taken from jail and put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The sinners now in the section of torment in Hades are awaiting the final judgment, which will take place at the white throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After that, the sinners will be cast into the lake of fire, the eternal prison.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The dead saints are in Paradise, and when the Lord Jesus comes, they will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They will not rise up to heaven; rather, they will rise up and then be caught up together with the living saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the reason verse 16 says that the dead in Christ will rise first.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then, according to verse 17, those who are living will be caught up at the same time with them to a meeting of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that all believers, the dead as well as the living, will be raptured to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This teaching is not sugar-coated, and it does not contain any leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the contrary, it is according to the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Word of God, when the Lord Jesus descends from heaven, the dead saints will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their spirit and soul will rise out of Paradise, their body will rise up from the tomb, and their spirit and soul with the body will make them perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They will then join the believers who are living, and together we shall all be caught up to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE RAPTURE OF THE LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 15 Paul says, "We who are living, who remain unto the coming of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 17 he also says, "We who are living, who remain."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why does Paul add the clause "who remain unto the coming of the Lord" in verse 15 and the clause "who remain" in verse 17?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you consider this matter thoughtfully, you will realize that this indicates, or at least implies, that there are some living ones who do not remain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some living ones are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These living ones who do not remain are overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is a difference between the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of those believers who are alive and remain until the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The rapture of the overcomers will take place before the last three and a half years, a period known as the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, the overcomers will be raptured before the tribulation Rev 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But those who are alive and remain will be raptured at the end of the tribulation, that is, at the last trumpet 1 Cor 15:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the rapture mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Regarding time, these two raptures are different: one takes place before the great tribulation, and the other, at the end of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, there is a difference regarding location.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to Revelation 12, the overcomers are raptured to the throne of God in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But according to 1 Thessalonians 4, the rapture of those who are alive and remain will be to the clouds in the air.</S>
