<h2 class=head1>The Death That Christ “Tasted”</h2><p>But now let us more seriously examine the substitutionary aspect of His death. What is meant by His “tasting death for every man?” (See Heb. 2:9.) Clearly this refers to something more than dissolution. What was this death? Let us again recall the definition of death as stated in our earlier lessons: “Death is a falling out of correspondence with environment.” It is the logical result of sin. Sinners cannot respond to God. This inability to respond causes a realized separation from Him. We have found that, so far as man is concerned, this separation would be of everlasting duration. Everlasting separation from God would mean everlasting death. This was the death that Christ “tasted.”<p>We see then very plainly that had He been the son of Joseph, and by a miracle the law of heredity had been set aside in order to render the child of sinful parents a sinless being, His benevolent attempt to become a sacrifice for the sin of His race would have involved Himself in this everlasting death; and it would not have effected any change in the status of the members of the race. Only a Being who possessed Uncreated Life could “taste” everlasting death without being held in its power. Only a Being who was under the “law of the Spirit of Life” could come within the sphere of the operation of “the law of sin and death” and render it inoperative by rising above it.<p>A very simple illustration will enable the class to grasp the meaning. An eagle is perched upon a crag overlooking a precipice. A serpent glides noiselessly towards the rock and fastens its coils upon the body of the bird. Both fall over the edge of the precipice, but before the bottom is reached, the eagle disentangles itself from the coils of the serpent and flies far up in the air, while the serpent falls to the earth below. The serpent is controlled by the force of gravity which draws it to the ground. The eagle feels the force of gravitation but overcomes it by the force of levitation.<p>The God-Man came into the world “with a death-bearing body and a Life-giving power” (Dr. Mabie); therefore, He could go down to the sphere of everlasting death, and rising above it in His Uncreated Life, He could take with Him those who should choose to go.<p>We are now able to perceive that something more than the death of Christ is needed to meet all the requirements of God’s Plan of Redemption. The claims of God’s holiness have been satisfied, but the claims of God’s Love must also be met. God wants sons—beings who shall share His Life; therefore the Last Adam must be manifested as the Head of a new order or race of righteous, holy, glorified human beings. This transformation of sinful human beings would seem to be analogous to the reconstructive work of God as narrated in Genesis 1:2, and might be fittingly termed a “new creation.” (See 2 Cor. 5:17.)<h2 class=head1>Christ’s Resurrection</h2><p>Accordingly, upon the third day after the body of Jesus had been placed in the tomb, the stone was found rolled away. Christ had arisen. Oh, the glorious Resurrection Morn! What does it mean to us? The teacher should have the various passages recording this event read and compared. The first appearance of Christ after His Resurrection was to Mary Magdalene. (See John 20:14-18.) The second is mentioned in Matthew 28:9, and the other appearances are given in their order: third, Luke 24:15-32; fourth, Luke 24:34; 1 Corinthians 15:5; fifth, Luke 24:36-43; sixth, John 20:19-25; seventh, John 20:26-29; eighth, John 21; ninth, Matthew 26:32; 28:16; tenth, 1 Corinthians 15:6; eleventh, 1 Corinthians 15:7[a]; twelfth, 1 Corinthians 15:7[b]; thirteenth, Acts 1:9-11; fourteenth, 1 Corinthians 15:8. Study each reference and note the numbers and classes of persons who were witnesses. Also carefully notice what Christ says about His glorified body. Note wherein it differed from His body before the Crucifixion.<p>The Resurrection is said to be the best attested fact of the Gospel Record and this indicates its importance, for without the Resurrection, there would be no positive proof of the efficacy of His death. (See Rom. 4:25; 1 Cor. 15:12-21.)<p>In the Resurrected Christ we behold the same Personality that walked and taught in Galilee. Those tender, searching eyes beam as of old, yet with a new luster. Those nail-scarred hands are the same that ministered in blessing to the sick and needy, yet their earthiness has disappeared. The disciples gaze upon their glorified Lord in amazement and awe, yet He convinces them that He is the “very same Jesus.” He permits them to handle Him; to examine the scars in His hands and the healed spear wound in His side (John 20:19-29). He eats before them (Luke 24:41-43); He enters into their daily needs and prepares their morning meal (John 21:1-14).<p>Can we understand this Resurrection power? No, for it belongs to God; but we shall experience it. The glorified body of our Lord shows us what our glorified bodies are to be. Not an atom is to be lost but changed. The teacher should now remove the black circle surrounding the star, and place over the white circles symbolizing spirit, soul and body, a gilt disc bearing similar circles and words. The star, denoting the Deity of the God-Man, is now seen over the gilt disc that symbolizes His glorified humanity.
