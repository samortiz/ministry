   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FRUIT OF CHRISTIAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Bible and according to our experience, this life produces two categories of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second Peter 1 and Galatians 5 show the first category.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first category of fruit is the category of Christian virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Peter tells us that we all have been "allotted like precious faith'' 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has allotted Himself to be our portion within us as our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then if we are diligent to supply virtue to faith, knowledge to virtue, self-control to knowledge, endurance to self-control, godliness to endurance, and brotherly love to godliness, we will reach God Himself as the very substance of the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The issue of faith as the seed of life growing within us to its full development is that God and we become one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Divinity is mingled with humanity to constitute us into God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All of these virtues in 2 Peter 1 are a kind of fruit 2 Pet 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we express these virtues day after day, this means that we are very fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Day after day in our daily walk we should bear such fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, people will not be able to see faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, brotherly love, or the divine love in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we will be barren, unfruitful, in these virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we live by taking Christ as our life, we will bear the fruit of Christian virtues day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The virtues in 2 Peter 1 are actually God's attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is faith, God is love, and God is all of our Christian virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's attributes, or characteristics, become our supply in different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When these divine attributes are expressed through us and by us in our daily walk, they become our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These Christian virtues have been filled up with God's attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The divine attributes expressed in our human virtues are the Christian virtues, which are the fruit in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Galatians 5 is another portion of the Word that tells us about this kind of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 16 says that we have to walk by the Spirit so that we will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit and the flesh are fighting against each other all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we walk by the Spirit, we will bear the fruit of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fruit of the Spirit is also the divine virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Galatians 5 Paul talked from another angle about the same thing as Peter did.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 2 Peter the divine power, the life power, has given us all things relating to life and godliness 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This divine power is just God Himself, the divine Being, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every kind of life has its own power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is divine, and His life is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is almighty and all-powerful, and He is now within us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul did not mention anything about the power of the divine life in Galatians 5, but he referred us to the very Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He said that it is by the Spirit that we can produce the fruit of Christian virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, the divine life as power gives us the energy to carry out all the beauties of the divine life, the virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, it is the Holy Spirit by whom we can bear all the spiritual fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, the Holy Spirit is the divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Holy Spirit refers to a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The divine power is a kind of energy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Person is the energy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to walk by the Holy Spirit as a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we walk by this Person, He becomes our energy, the divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we eat a good breakfast, this breakfast becomes the energy within us to energize us during the day, giving us the strength to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We Christians have a divine energy within us that energizes us all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This energy is actually a Person, the very Triune God consummated to be the all-inclusive Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By this Person we can live a life full of virtues, which are the fruit that we bear every day.</S>
