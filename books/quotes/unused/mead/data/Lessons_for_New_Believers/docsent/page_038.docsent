   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Introduction to Lead the Meeting to the Subject</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>according to the Feeling</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No meeting is without a subject or purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once a meeting has begun, we need to lead it to the subject according to the feeling of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The introduction must be done through prayer, speaking, or singing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, at a meeting we may sense that the feeling of the brothers and sisters is that the Lord is in glory; hence, this is the feeling and subject of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should rise up to offer a prayer, speak a few words, or select an appropriate hymn in order to lead everyone to the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Strengthening</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>to Strengthen the Spirit of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the meeting is led to its subject, the spirit of the meeting may not be strong; thus, it may require some strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Strengthening the spirit of a meeting also requires some skill.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Selecting a hymn, offering a prayer, or speaking a few words are the ways to strengthen the spirit of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Uplifting to Uplift the Spirit of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the spirit of a meeting is not high enough after strengthening, it needs to be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This also requires some skill.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The means to uplift the spirit of a meeting is also by singing, prayer, or speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Maintaining to Maintain the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When, through strengthening and uplifting, the spirit of a meeting reaches a peak, we should maintain it at this peak for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes after reaching the peak, a meeting goes down too quickly because of a lack in maintaining the spirit of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, the meeting is not very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, maintaining the spirit of a meeting is also very necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The spirit of a meeting is seldom maintained by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because speaking does not have much function in this step.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because it is difficult to select a fitting hymn, it is also difficult to maintain the spirit by singing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The most effective way to maintain the spirit of a meeting is for a few brothers and sisters to offer prayers with a strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have been in several meetings when some brothers and sisters prayed one after another and thereby maintained the spirit of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such meetings edify the spirit of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Filling the Time</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>to Fill Up the Remaining Time of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes although everything is accomplished in a meeting, there is still time left because it is too early to end the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The remaining time should be filled with singing, prayer, or speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Filling the time is similar to maintaining the spirit of a meeting, but there is a slight difference.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Maintaining the spirit is keeping the spirit of a meeting at the peak after the peak has been reached.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, if a meeting does not have a peak, or if it is somewhat flat, and if it is not time for the meeting to end, there is the need to fill the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The requirement for filling the time is not that high, but we should avoid routine practices.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In filling the time there should be the addition of a spiritual atmosphere and flavor to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ending to End the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The ending is to end a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is much involved in ending a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have many meetings that have a good opening but a poor ending.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ending can be compared to tying a knot.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we travel, we tie our luggage with a knot at the end of the rope after everything is bundled up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the knot is not tied securely, the luggage will open up when it is being transported.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A meeting that progresses through all the steps but has a weak ending will leave the saints without a solid feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In contrast, a meeting that is flat and weak in its progression but nevertheless has a strong ending will leave the saints with a good taste.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The ending of a meeting is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who learn to take the lead in the meeting must learn this matter so that the meeting can end in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can end a meeting with a hymn or with some speaking, but the best way to end a meeting is through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This does not mean that a meeting must always end with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From our experience, however, we know that prayer is the best way to end a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A meeting that does not end with prayer may cause the saints to feel that the meeting has not ended.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sending Off to Express</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>the Lingering Riches of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sending off is derived from Genesis 18 where Abraham sent Jehovah off.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sending off expresses the lingering riches of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is the need of sending off when a rich meeting produces a lingering atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For example, when we sense such a lingering atmosphere, we can stand up and share a few words, even though a brother has already ended the meeting with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This kind of sending off leaves the saints full of a pleasant taste.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead of speaking a word, we may offer another prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Seemingly this is repetitious, but it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is sending off, which strengthens the lingering air of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is also appropriate to send off with a short hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, after the bread-breaking meeting has ended, we may still sing the last stanza of Hymns, #33, Loving Father, now before Thee / We will ever praise Thy love.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a sending off.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These are the eight steps in the progression of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It may not be necessary for a meeting to progress through the steps of maintaining the spirit, filling the time, and sending off.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even the uplifting step may not be necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The remaining four steps, however, are necessary in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every meeting should have an opening, an introduction, a strengthening, and an ending.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A new believer may not be able to take care of these steps of progression in a meeting, but he needs to know these steps.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Gradually, he should learn to take care of these steps in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should bring all our meetings through this progression.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not a law; rather, this is a spontaneous progression.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After a meeting begins, there is an introduction, then strengthening, uplifting, and maintaining the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If there is still more time before the meeting should end, there is the need to fill the time before the ending.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If there is a lingering air after the ending, there is a need for sending off.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A meeting with these steps of progression is rich and supplying.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Correction and Turning</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Apart from these eight steps of progression, there are two supplementary steps.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Correcting</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Correcting is to correct the selection of a wrong hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For example, a hymn on prayer may be selected in a bread-breaking meeting, a hymn to praise the Lord may be selected after we have begun to worship the Father, or a hymn to praise the Lord s glory may be selected while we are remembering the Lord s suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>These hymns do not match the atmosphere of the meeting; rather, they distract the spirit of the meeting and must therefore be corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Sometimes we may wait until the hymn is sung and then select another hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Or we may immediately select another hymn, but this must be done carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The person being corrected may be offended if this is not handled properly.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Any correction should be done gently.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must be skillful in correcting.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Turning</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Turning is to turn the subject of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>For example, although the feeling of a meeting may obviously be the Lord s suffering on the cross, a brother calls Hymns, #127, which is on the Lord s exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Singing this hymn cannot uplift people s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>A brother follows with a prayer, but the spirit is still not uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Another brother may select a hymn on the Lord s love, but this still cannot move the spirit of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, when the subject is returned to the Lord s suffering, the spirit of the brothers and sisters is released through singing a hymn and prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is because the feeling of the meeting was on the Lord s suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>There was thus the need for turning.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Although there is the need for correcting and turning, they should not be practiced in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we do not know how to correct properly, we should not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we do not know how to turn the subject in a suitable way, we should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We need to have some confidence before correcting and turning.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We should also be gentle and not harsh in order to avoid hurting others.</S>
