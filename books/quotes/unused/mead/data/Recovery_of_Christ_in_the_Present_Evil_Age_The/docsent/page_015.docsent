   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE BEING RESCUED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUT OF THE PRESENT EVIL AGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AS THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT NEEDING TO BE RESCUED OUT OF</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE PRESENT EVIL AGE, THE RELIGIOUS WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Galatians deals with the present evil age, the religious world 1:4; 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To try to keep the law is something of religion 2:16, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to this principle, to try to do good or improve oneself to please God is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Circumcision also is something of religion 5:6; 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that to keep any form, ritual, or regulation is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two definitions of religion are great principles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Human beings seemingly cannot stay away from trying to do good or from keeping forms, rituals, and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We often keep forms and rituals without realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church life we may even attend meetings as a religious form or ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, to decide not to go to a meeting is also religion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To try to do good is religion, but to try not to do good is also religion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To keep a form is religion, but not to keep the form may also be religion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to drop all religion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only Christ is not religion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE SUBJECTIVE CHRIST BEING VERSUS RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Galatians the apostle Paul says that he was formerly in religion and was even a leading one there 1:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But one day it pleased God to reveal His Son in Paul vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows that Christ is versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After seeing the present evil age in Galatians 1, we see the subjective Christ Christ revealed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Christ who is versus religion is not the objective, doctrinal Christ but the subjective, experiential Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Galatians 2:20 says, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then 3:27 says that we who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Finally, 4:19 says that Christ is being formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that Christ needs to be constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 3:17 reveals that Christ is making His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every part of our inner being our mind, emotion, and will needs to be saturated and possessed by Christ so that He can be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the subjective Christ who is versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE EMPHASIS IN GALATIANS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>SHIFTING FROM CHRIST TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Galatians 3 the emphasis begins to shift from Christ to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verses 2 through 3 speak of receiving and being perfected by the Spirit, and verse 14 speaks of receiving the promise of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s blessing in the gospel is to minister the Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we receive the Spirit, we are born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Galatians 4:6 says, Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then 5:25 says, If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit today is one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The divine Spirit mingles Himself with our human spirit to be one wonderful spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we need to live and walk in this mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Galatians 6:1 says that even when we see a brother overtaken by sin, we need to restore him in our spirit, which is mingled with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 8 says, He who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the middle of Galatians the crucial point shifts from Christ to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ and the Spirit are one, but we need to see the difference between Christ and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The title Christ, which means the anointed One, implies the Lord s divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ as the Son of God was incarnated to be the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is a wonderful person with divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As one who is both God and man, Christ was uniquely qualified to be anointed, appointed, and commissioned by God to fulfill God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first and the main thing that Christ did to fulfill God s eternal purpose was to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the cross Christ took away our sin Heb 9:26; John 1:29 and our sins 1 Pet 2:24 , dealt with the world Gal 6:14 , crucified our old man Rom 6:6 and our old I Gal 2:20 , destroyed the devil Heb 2:14 , and abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the negative things were taken away by Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By accomplishing redemption, Christ, the anointed One, opened the way for God to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because God is righteous and holy, He could not do anything to be one with man until Christ had accomplished a full redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ s work on the cross gave God the full liberty to come in to accomplish His purpose with man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After His death Christ was resurrected to impart His life into all His believers, making them His members John 12:24; 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, Christ ascended to the heavens far above all Eph 1:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The powers on the earth and the evil powers in the air could not hold Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He transcended everything and ascended into the heavens, where He was made the Head over all things to the church v. 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After accomplishing redemption, Christ became the life-giving Spirit to indwell us 1 Cor 15:45b; John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ and the Spirit are two parts, which together form a complete view.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To illustrate, being a student is the first part of a person s career.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After earning a college degree, a student may enter a profession, such as teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, the student and the teacher are two parts of a complete whole.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The student and the teacher are not different persons; they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, without first being a student, a person is not qualified to be a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The first part qualifies a person for the second part.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Likewise, to become the indwelling Spirit, Christ first had to be incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christ s processes qualified Him to become the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For this reason, the book of Galatians first focuses on Christ and then emphasizes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When a student becomes a teacher, it does not mean that his qualifications as a student are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, the teacher still possesses all the qualifications of the student.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Similarly, Christ, who today is the Spirit, still possesses His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The indwelling Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is not only in us but also in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the heavens He is the Christ; in us He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christ and the Spirit are one.</S>
