<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of twenty-two messages given by Brother Witness Lee in special edification meetings on Christ and the cross. The place where these messages were given is not known. The messages were originally published in 1952 and 1953 in <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em></p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:23; 2:2; 1:24, 18; Luke 1:35; 2:11; Matt. 16:16; Rom. 1:4; Acts 2:36; John 20:31</h1>
<h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In the following chapters we will consider Christ and the cross exclusively. Those who know the Bible know that Christ and the cross are the center and the reality of the Bible. If Christ and the cross were removed from the Bible, the Bible would be an empty book. The Bible is precious in its revelation of Christ and the cross. We will appreciate the preciousness of the Bible only when we know Christ and the cross.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:23 Paul speaks of preaching Christ crucified. Paul did not determine to know anything among the Corinthians except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified (2:2). He knew Christ as the totality of the power and wisdom of God (1:24), and he also knew the word of the cross as the power of God to those who are being saved (v. 18). The center of Paul&rsquo;s message and work is Christ and the cross. All the apostles, who were sent by God to preach and work on His behalf, emphasized Christ and the cross. This is the message and work that God entrusted to the apostles.</p>
<p>Although we have been saved by grace, I am concerned that we do not know Christ or His cross adequately. In order for us to grow in life, to see the spiritual things and the spiritual way, and to be proper Christians, we must know Christ and the cross. A person who does not know Christ and the cross cannot do a spiritual work or service that satisfies God&rsquo;s heart. In order to grow spiritually or do a spiritual work, such as preaching the gospel or administrating the church, we must know Christ and the cross.</p>
<p>Believers are poor and weak, and the churches are desolate and chaotic because believers and the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones do not know Christ and the cross. Only by knowing Christ and the cross can believers be edified more in life and the church be established so that the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ will increase in the church (Eph. 4:13). Hence, we will spend considerable time in these chapters to consider the matter of Christ and the cross.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals Christ and the cross in ways that are beyond our thought. Without God&rsquo;s mercy, without the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s presence, and without a proper heart and a clear, strong spirit, we would feel that the Bible&rsquo;s profound, central word on Christ and the cross is vague, mysterious, and unfathomable. Like those in John 6, who heard but could not understand the Lord&rsquo;s words concerning eternal life, we would say, &ldquo;This word is hard; who can hear it?&rdquo; (v. 60). We must look to the Lord for a proper heart and a strong spirit in order to listen with our heart and receive with our spirit and then remember, muse upon, and turn this word into prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In this chapter we come to the person of Christ, and we must ask, &ldquo;Who is Christ?&rdquo; All believers can answer that He is our Savior, and according to our human feeling and with respect to us, He is our Savior. However, according to God&rsquo;s revelation and with respect to God, Christ far exceeds what we can say or know about Him.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God and the Christ of God. In Luke 1:35 the angel Gabriel told Mary that the Holy Spirit would come upon her, and the power of the Most High would overshadow her; therefore, the holy thing which was born would be called the Son of God. In 2:11 an angel of God told the shepherds that a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, had been born to them in David&rsquo;s city. Matthew 16:16 records that when the Lord Jesus came out to minister, the Father revealed to Peter that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. Romans 1:4 says that when the Lord Jesus came out of the resurrection of the dead, He was designated the Son of God in power. In Acts 2:36 Peter witnessed, saying, &ldquo;Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified.&rdquo; At the end of his Gospel, John says, &ldquo;These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name&rdquo; (20:31). From the time of the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, everyone who wants to be saved must believe that He is the Christ, the Son of God. These verses show that the New Testament emphasizes that the Lord Jesus is both the Son of God and the Christ of God. Although the Bible contains many titles for the Lord Jesus, there is not another title more important and crucial than either <em>the Son of God</em> or <em>the Christ of God.</em></p>
<p>These two titles speak of the two statuses of the Lord Jesus. <em>The Son of God</em> speaks of His person, and <em>the Christ of God</em> speaks of His ministry. With respect to the Lord&rsquo;s person, He is the Son of God. With respect to the Lord&rsquo;s ministry and work, He is the Christ of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SON OF GOD</h2>
<p>The Son of God is the expression of God, the manifestation of God. As the Father, God is hidden. As the Son, God comes forth and is manifested among men. As the God who dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16), He is the Father. As the God who comes forth and manifests Himself to man, He is the Son. The Father is the source of the Son, and the Son is the expression of the Father. The Son is hidden in the Father, and the Father is manifested in the Son. Thus, when we speak of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, we are speaking of the Lord as the manifestation, the expression, of God. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:3 speaks of the Son of God being the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory. This can be illustrated by the light from the sun. Sunlight is the effulgence of the sun, and we can see and contact the sun through its light. The sun is far from us, and no one has ever touched or come into contact with the sun itself. However, the light from the sun, as the effulgence of the sun, reaches us. This effulgence is the manifestation of the sun, the expression of the sun. Although God dwells in unapproachable light and no man has seen Him, God has been manifested in the Son for man to see and contact.</p>
<p>The Son of God is also the impress of God&rsquo;s substance (v. 3). An impress is a seal. This indicates that the Son of God is the expression of God, the true expression of God. He declares nothing less than God Himself. Therefore, the Son of God said, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9), and &ldquo;He who receives Me receives Him who has sent Me&rdquo; (Matt. 10:40). God is in the Son (John 10:38); therefore, God is the inner substance of the Son, and the Son is the outward expression of God.</p>
<p>The Son of God is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15); all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in Christ, the Son (2:9). The Son of God is the embodiment of God; apart from Him man cannot see God. Indeed, apart from Him there is no God to us. God is hidden in the Son, and God is expressed through the Son.</p>
<p>John 1:1 reveals that the Son of God is the Word who was with God in the beginning and the Word who was God. <em>Word</em> in verse 1 is <em>logos</em> in Greek, which denotes the constant word. We all know that words are the expression of a person. If a person does not speak, we have no way of knowing him. Everything in a person is expressed through his word. John 1 reveals that the Son of God is the Word of God; the Son of God is the utterance of God and speaks forth everything that is in God. He has been with God from the beginning, that is, from eternity, because He is God. In the heavens He is the Word hidden in God. On the earth He is the manifested God, the Word who expresses God in order for man to understand and know God. The Son of God is the utterance of God, the manifestation of God.</p>
<p>There is a group of so-called Christians in the Philippines who are considerable in number and influence. However, they do not believe that Jesus is God. Once I was in Manila, and they made an appointment to speak with me. Of the four who came, two of them were quite eloquent. For this time, I also asked two brothers to be with me. Because we heard that they did not believe that the Lord Jesus is God, we asked them at the very beginning whether they believed that Christ is God. One of them replied, &ldquo;Where is there a sentence in the Bible that says Christ is God?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;John 1:1 says, &lsquo;The Word was God.&rsquo;&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes, the Word was God, but it does not say that Christ was God.&rdquo; Upon hearing this, I was astonished and asked, &ldquo;Then who do you say that the Word is?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;The Word is God.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Please read verse 14, which says, &lsquo;The Word became flesh.&rsquo;&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;To whom does <em>flesh</em> refer?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;It refers to Christ.&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;If verse 1 says that the Word was God, and verse 14 says that the Word, who is Christ, became flesh, does this not tell us that Christ is God?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Undoubtedly, the Word was God before the Word became flesh, but when the Word became flesh, the Word changed.&rdquo; I then asked, &ldquo;Did the Word change in such a way that He was no longer God?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; and then he asked, &ldquo;Where does it say in the Bible that the Word was still God after becoming flesh?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;The Word was God, and the Word became flesh. Was this One who became flesh God or not?&rdquo; He could only respond, saying, &ldquo;Your logic is wrong. The Bible does not specifically say that the Word was still God after becoming flesh.&rdquo; After hearing this, we felt that we could not go on, and our talk ended inconclusively.</p>
<p>There are two verses in the Bible that prove the Lord Jesus is God becoming flesh, that is, that He still possessed the substance and nature of God even though He became flesh. Isaiah 7:14 says, &ldquo;The virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; <em>Immanuel</em> means &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (Matt. 1:23). This verse refers to the Lord Jesus, who, as the Word, became flesh and tabernacled among us by being conceived and born of a virgin (John 1:14). This One was God with us, and in His becoming flesh, there was no loss of His divinity. How can anyone say that He was no longer God after becoming flesh? As God become flesh, Christ was still God with God&rsquo;s substance and nature.</p>
<p>Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; /...And His name will be called /...Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; This verse also refers to the Lord Jesus and clearly indicates that the child who was born to us and who became flesh was still the Mighty God. Although He was given to us as a Son in time, He was still the Father in eternity. The Son who was manifested in time is the Father hidden in eternity; as a child in the flesh, He was the Mighty God. Even though He was the manifested Son, He was still the Father, and even though He was a child in the flesh, He was still the Mighty God. He did not cease to be God simply because He became flesh.</p>
<p>We must know assuredly that the Lord Jesus is God. He has God&rsquo;s life and nature as well as His divinity and glory; He is God Himself. He is God coming forth, God manifested among men. He is not only God in Himself but also God becoming flesh. God has been manifested in the flesh in order for us to know and contact Him. The hidden God, the Father, could not be known or contacted without being manifested in the flesh as the Son.</p>
<p>Thoughts that are hidden within men must be spoken forth as words in order to be understood by others. Similarly, the hidden Father had to be manifested in the Son in order to be known and touched by us. The Lord Jesus is indeed the Father coming forth in the Son. God is not only the hidden Father but also the manifested Son. When a person&rsquo;s thoughts become words and come forth as words, others touch his thoughts in his words. Similarly, when a man encounters the Son, he touches the Father. Thus, he who believes into the Son believes into the Father who sent the Son (John 12:44). The Father sent the Son for His expression. Without the coming of the Son in the flesh, we would have no way of knowing the Father. Thankfully, the Son has come, and we can know the Father through the Son.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRIST OF GOD</h2>
<p><em>Christ,</em> which is <em>Christos</em> in Greek (Matt. 1:16), is the equivalent of <em>Messiah</em> in Hebrew (John 1:41; Dan. 9:26), and it refers to the Lord Jesus as the anointed One (Luke 4:18; Heb. 1:9). In the Old Testament God anointed those whom He wanted to be prophets, priests, or kings and those to whom He wanted to entrust something related to the accomplishment of His will (Exo. 28:41; 1 Sam. 16:13). Those who were anointed by God were His anointed ones. Every anointed one in the Old Testament is a type of the Lord Jesus as God&rsquo;s anointed One. The Lord Jesus is the true anointed One of God, the Christ of God.</p>
<p>As the Son of God, Christ was anointed by God to become God&rsquo;s Christ, His anointed One. In other words, God&rsquo;s Son, as God&rsquo;s anointed One, was entrusted and sent by God to do His work and fulfill His plan. In the Godhead He is the Son of God with God&rsquo;s life to express God&rsquo;s glory; in God&rsquo;s plan He is also the Christ of God to do God&rsquo;s work and fulfill God&rsquo;s will. According to what He is, He is the Son of God who expresses God; according to what He does, He is also the Christ of God to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. Through Christ as the Son of God, we know God. Through Christ as the Christ of God, we see God&rsquo;s plan. In the Son of God we have God Himself; in the Christ of God we share in God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>As the Son of God, Christ possesses God&rsquo;s divinity, which is eternal; as the Christ of God, Christ carries out God&rsquo;s eternal plan. In eternity without beginning, the Son of God was with God and was God. For the unfolding of God&rsquo;s eternal plan, the Son was appointed as the Christ of God. In His person the Son of God existed in eternity without beginning, and in His work to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal plan the Son of God is also revealed as the Christ of God.</p>
<p><em>The Son of God</em> speaks of His being God&rsquo;s manifestation with God&rsquo;s life to express God; <em>the Christ of God</em> speaks of His being God&rsquo;s anointed One who is entrusted by God to accomplish His plan. Both God and God&rsquo;s plan are focused on the Lord; in Him we see God&rsquo;s person and God&rsquo;s work. God&rsquo;s life and nature as well as His deity and glory are expressed through Him, and God&rsquo;s work and purpose are fulfilled through Him. He expresses God and fulfills God&rsquo;s plan; He is the Son of God and the Christ of God. The Lord whom we believe in, love, and serve is both the Son of God and the Christ of God.</p>
<p>If anyone asks, &ldquo;Who is the Lord Jesus?&rdquo; it is not enough for us to reply, &ldquo;He is the Son of God, God&rsquo;s expression.&rdquo; This is because He is not merely the Son of God but also the Christ of God, God&rsquo;s anointed One. He not only has God&rsquo;s life and nature to express God, but He also has been entrusted and sent by God to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. We should not merely believe that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God, we must also believe that He is the Christ of God. As the Son of God, He expresses God Himself; as the Christ of God, He fulfills God&rsquo;s plan. In Him we can know God and see God&rsquo;s plan. Apart from Him, we cannot meet God or share in God&rsquo;s plan. In Him there is God, and through Him there is the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s plan. Both what God is and what God is doing are in Him. He is what God is, and He does what God does; He is God accomplishing God&rsquo;s plan. This is the Lord whom we believe in, the One who is God Himself and who has accomplished God&rsquo;s plan. He expresses God and fulfills God&rsquo;s plan.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:9-10; 3:9-11; 1 Pet. 1:20; Heb. 1:2; Col. 1:18; 2:2; 3:11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN BEFORE<br />
THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p>Before the foundation of the world, that is, in eternity past, God had a plan, which He purposed in Himself according to His good pleasure (Eph. 1:9). In eternity past, before time began and before the creation of the universe, God&rsquo;s eternal plan was according to the good pleasure of His will. Based on this plan, He created all things in the universe, but He did not reveal His plan to man or to any creature. His plan was a mystery hidden in Himself (3:9). Although the universe came into being according to His plan, and all things were created because of God&rsquo;s will (Rev. 4:11), the intention of God&rsquo;s plan for the universe and for His creation of all things was a mystery hidden in God until it was revealed to man in the New Testament age (Eph. 3:3-5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN BEING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:9 speaks of God&rsquo;s eternal plan being purposed in Himself, and 3:11 speaks of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose being made in Christ Jesus our Lord. This shows that what God determined and planned in Himself, He determined in Christ. God&rsquo;s plan was determined in eternity in Himself and in Christ Jesus our Lord. God&rsquo;s plan is inseparable from Himself and Christ.</p>
<p>Christ was in eternity, before the foundation of the world; He did not come into being when He became flesh at Bethlehem. Before the universe or mankind came into existence, Christ was. When God determined His plan in eternity, Christ was. When God determined a plan in Himself according to His good pleasure, He appointed the Son to be His anointed One, His Christ. First Peter 1:20 says, &ldquo;Who [Christ] was foreknown before the foundation of the world.&rdquo; Hebrews 1:2 says, &ldquo;Whom [the Son of God] He [God] appointed Heir of all things.&rdquo; Although Christ was &ldquo;manifested in the last of times&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:20), He was before the foundation of the world, and although He will become Heir of all things in the future, His appointment to be the Heir of all things was before the foundation of the world. Before the foundation of the world, before there was heaven or earth or time, God the Father, because of His love for the Son (John 3:35), appointed the Son to be the Christ who would accomplish His plan and become Heir of all things. The Son of God was appointed to be the Christ of God, and God&rsquo;s plan was determined in Christ.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is in Christ; Christ is the sphere of God&rsquo;s plan. All God&rsquo;s plan is in Christ as the sphere; all that God predestinated, intended, and arranged in eternity is carried out in Christ. Apart from Christ, there is no plan of God; outside of Christ, God&rsquo;s will cannot be accomplished. Since God loves the Son, He delights in all that He is being in the Son so that the Son might have the first place in all things and be exalted and glorified (Col. 1:15-18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN BEING FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is in Christ, and it is for Christ. Everything that God has planned is for the purpose of expressing Christ and is for Christ to inherit; Christ is the center and the purpose of God&rsquo;s plan. Because Christ is God&rsquo;s beloved Son, because God loves His Son, all His heart&rsquo;s desire in His plan is for His Son. Because the Father loves the Son and delights in the Son being glorified&mdash;expressed&mdash;and inheriting all things, God&rsquo;s plan in eternity is for the Son and for the Son to be His Christ.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that God in His eternal plan determined that the glory of Christ would be expressed through all things and mankind and that Christ would be the center of all things, the Head of all things, and the Heir of all things (Rom. 11:36; Eph. 1:10, 22; Col. 1:16-18; Heb. 1:2). This is the center and purpose of everything that God planned before the foundation of the world. God, according to His foreknowledge, knew that in order to accomplish such a purpose, there would be a need for creation and redemption. Thus, God determined in His plan according to His foreknowledge that there would be both creation and redemption. The purpose of His creation and redemption is to express Christ so that He might be glorified in the universe and have the first place in all things (Col. 1:18).</p>
<p>The universe and all things are a mystery to man. Why is there a universe? Why were all things created? What is the meaning of human life? To man, these are unknowable mysteries. Throughout the generations men have spent countless hours probing and researching these mysteries, hoping to solve them, but everyone has failed because they do not know God&rsquo;s eternal plan or God&rsquo;s purpose in Christ. Even the patriarchs and the prophets in the Old Testament did not know the answer to these mysteries. If we could ask Abraham, Moses, David, or Isaiah, they would not be able to unravel these mysteries. Even if we read all thirty-nine books of the Old Testament thoroughly, we still would not be able to find the answers, because God did not make known His eternal plan and purpose concerning Christ until the New Testament. God&rsquo;s plan and purpose were hidden in Himself until He, through the Holy Spirit, lifted the heavenly veil and revealed the mystery hidden in Himself to His holy apostles and prophets (Eph. 3:5). Only then was Christ, as the mystery hidden in God throughout the ages, revealed and made known (v. 9). Christ is the purpose of God&rsquo;s plan. Creation and redemption are for Christ. Christ is the center of the universe and the purpose of all things. Mankind lives for Christ, and the meaning of human life is Christ. Christ is the answer to the mystery of the universe and human life.</p>
<p>God created all things for Christ, and God created mankind for Christ. The whole universe in God&rsquo;s plan is for Christ. God planned, purposed, intended, and arranged everything in eternity so that mankind and all things would express Christ and the things in the heavens and the things on the earth would be headed up in Christ (1:10) so that Christ would fill the universe and be fully expressed in glory and so that Christ might have the first place in all things. This is the purpose of God&rsquo;s eternal plan. Only those who know Christ can know the purpose of the universe and the meaning of human life.</p>
<p>If we could go into eternity past to see the plan that was in God before the foundation of the world, we would see that every thought, idea, point, and aspect in God&rsquo;s plan are for Christ. The heavens He planned are for Christ, and the earth He designed is for Christ. He created all things to express Christ, and He created mankind to express Christ. The existence of everything according to His determination is for the purpose of expressing Christ. He wants the heavens to be filled with Christ and the earth to be filled with Christ. He wants everything and everyone to be filled with Christ. Although this is not the case on earth today, God will head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth (v. 10). At the fullness of the times, according to God&rsquo;s arrangement and plan, all things will be filled with Christ and express Christ. This has not yet been fully accomplished, but a miniature of this coming accomplishment exists today.</p>
<p>Even though all things do not express Christ today, the expression of Christ through Christians is in line with God&rsquo;s eternal plan. Today a group of Christians expresses Christ; in the future all things will express Christ. Today Christ is expressed in part through Christians; in the future Christ will be expressed through all things. One day God will cause the universe and all things to be filled with Christ and to express Christ. Until that day Christians are the firstfruits in the universe, taking the lead to be filled with Christ and to express Christ. This is based on God&rsquo;s plan and according to God&rsquo;s arrangement.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN BEING THROUGH CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan exists not only for Christ but also through Christ. God did not make a plan for Christ and then send an archangel to carry it out. His plan for Christ was determined in Christ in order to be fulfilled by Christ. Christ is the sphere of God&rsquo;s plan, the center and purpose of God&rsquo;s plan, and the means and fulfillment of God&rsquo;s plan. Apart from Christ, no one is worthy to inherit what God has planned, and no one is worthy to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. God&rsquo;s plan can be inherited only by Christ and fulfilled only through Christ. Thus, before the foundation of the world, God had a plan for His beloved Son, and He anointed His beloved Son, His Christ, with a commission to fulfill His plan. Apart from the beloved Son, no one is worthy to undertake the commission to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. Only the beloved Son as the Christ of God is worthy to fulfill His plan. Only Christ is worthy to inherit the glory of fulfilling His plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is not only in Christ, for Christ, and through Christ; it is even Christ Himself. Every part of God&rsquo;s plan is Christ. Christ is the sphere of God&rsquo;s plan, the purpose of God&rsquo;s plan, the means of God&rsquo;s plan, and God&rsquo;s plan itself. God&rsquo;s plan is Christ. In Colossians 2:2 the apostle Paul speaks of &ldquo;the mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; <em>The mystery of God</em> in this verse refers to God&rsquo;s plan. It is the mystery of God because it was hidden in God (Rom. 16:25). When the apostle speaks of the mystery of God being Christ, he means that God&rsquo;s plan is Christ. Christ is God&rsquo;s plan. Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s plan and the circumference of God&rsquo;s plan. He is the meaning of God&rsquo;s plan and the content of God&rsquo;s plan. All God&rsquo;s plan is Christ, because God delights that Christ would have the first place in all things (Col. 1:18).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN GOD&rsquo;S CREATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26-27; John 1:3; 3:35; Col. 1:15-18; Heb. 1:2-3; Rev. 3:14; 4:11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PLAN</h2>
<p>Before the foundation of the world, God had a plan in Christ and for Christ. Based on His plan, God created in order to accomplish His plan. God&rsquo;s creation is for the accomplishment of His plan, and His creation is according to His plan. All things have meaning, but they are not self-existing and self-generating. According to God&rsquo;s plan, all things were and were created because of God&rsquo;s will (Rev. 4:11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THINGS BEING CREATED THROUGH CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is in Christ, and God&rsquo;s creation is through Christ. Without Christ, God has no plan, and without Christ, God has no creation. All God&rsquo;s plan and creation are in Christ. He planned in Christ and created through Christ. All things came into being through Christ, and apart from Christ not one thing came into being which has come into being (John 1:3). Christ is the sphere of God&rsquo;s plan and the means of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>We should not think that only redemption is in Christ and that creation has nothing to do with Christ. God&rsquo;s creation is through Christ and in Christ. Colossians 1:16 says, &ldquo;In Him all things were created...; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&rdquo; This indicates that all things are through Christ and because of Christ. Although God wanted to create all things, nothing was created apart from Christ. Just as God did not redeem apart from Christ, He did not create apart from Christ. God redeemed in Christ, and God created in Christ. God created all things in Christ and through Christ; thus, all things&mdash;in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible&mdash;were created in Christ and came into being through Christ. Christ is the Creator of all things, and all things are the creation of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE FIRSTBORN OF ALL CREATION</h2>
<p>The Bible tells us that Christ is not only the Creator of all things but also &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation&rdquo; (v. 15). This means that Christ is the first creature, the first of creation. Although He is the Creator, He became flesh, a creature. Hence, in God&rsquo;s eyes Christ was not only the Creator at the time of creation, but He was also a creature. In God&rsquo;s eyes Christ was a creature when creation began; He is &ldquo;the beginning of the creation of God&rdquo; (Rev. 3:14). Since Christ is a creature in God&rsquo;s eyes, God could be &ldquo;in Him&rdquo; and could take Him as the base and means to create through Him so that all created things would be created in Him and be out from Him (Col. 1:16).</p>
<p>From our perspective Christ became flesh, a creature, four thousand years after Adam was created. Yet from God&rsquo;s perspective, Christ is the Firstborn of all creation; that is, He was a creature at the beginning of creation. This is possible because God is not limited by time. From the beginning of the creation of all things, Christ has been a creature; therefore, He is the Firstborn of all creation, the first of all created things. In creation Christ not only represents the Creator but also the creature. He is both the Lord who creates and the Firstborn of all creation. In Him we see both Creator and creature.</p>
<p>God made Christ the Firstborn of all creation so that all creation would be out from Him and so that He would &ldquo;have the first place in all things&rdquo; (v. 18). The first place in all creation and the first place in all things belong only to Him. He is not merely the Creator, who is above all creation, but also the Firstborn of all creation, the One who is before all creation. Christ is above all as the Lord of all, and He is before all as the Firstborn of all creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL CREATION EXPRESSING CHRIST</h2>
<p>God created all things in Christ and through Christ so that all things would express Christ. God made Christ the Creator of all things so that all things might be an expression of Christ. Anything that is made expresses and represents its maker. A person&rsquo;s thoughts, character, innate ability, and wisdom are expressed through the things that he makes, and it is possible for others to understand him through the things he makes.</p>
<p>For example, the character and ability of the creator of a building, a machine, a writing, or a picture are expressed and represented in the thing that is made. In the same way Christ created all things, and all things express the wisdom and power of Christ. When we look at all things, we should see the Creator of all things, the Christ who created all things. When we look at these things, we should see the glory, beauty, wisdom, and power of Christ. If we understand God&rsquo;s intention adequately, we will realize that God desires that everything in creation would express Christ. If we truly know God&rsquo;s creation, we will see that it is an expression of Christ, declaring His wisdom and power.</p>
<p>If we know the maker of a delicate item, we will think of its maker when we see the item. If you have written something beautiful, every time people read it, you will &ldquo;appear&rdquo; in their reading, and they will spontaneously get a &ldquo;taste&rdquo; of you. Although people are reading what you have written, they are actually reading you. If we know Christ and look at all things with the view to knowing Christ, we will sense that all things are filled with Christ and are Christ. Although these things are not Christ Himself, those who know Christ will have a sense that they express Christ. The universe is great and wonderful, and all things are bright and beautiful to express the power of Christ and to declare the glory and beauty of Christ. Although all things cannot express His power, glory, and beauty completely, let alone Himself fully, they enable us to know of Him and of His power, glory, and beauty. Thus, before He was incarnated in time on earth, He was being expressed in creation through all things for man to see, know, and appreciate.</p>
<p>All created things not only prove the existence of God but also express Christ. Since the creation of the world, God can be known and the invisible things of God can be perceived through the things made (Rom. 1:20-21). When man looks at all things, he naturally knows that there is a God who created all things; however, in order for man to see in these things the Christ who created them, there is a need for revelation. We can know God by seeing all things in nature, but we can know Christ only by seeing all things with revelation. Without revelation it is possible for people to have a sense of God through the wonder of His creation, but it is not possible for them to see that even the finest detail of the things that have been made expresses the power, glory, and beauty of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">CREATED MAN REPRESENTING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Although all things of creation express Christ, they do not represent Christ fully. Consequently, God made man to be Christ&rsquo;s explicit representative by creating man in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:26). Christ is the image of God (2 Cor. 4:4). Therefore, man was made according to Christ. Created man is a type of Christ in order to fully represent Christ (Rom. 5:14).</p>
<p>Many know only that Christ came in the likeness of men and was found in fashion as a man when He was incarnated (Phil. 2:7-8). But we must realize that man was created according to the image of Christ. Before Christ took on human form in His incarnation, man was created according to His image. Thus, created man had His image, and created man was in His image. Nevertheless, man did not have His life. Christ was incarnated in the humanity that was created according to His image so that man might have His life. This is like a sculptor who makes a wax figure according to his own image. Although the wax figure has his image, it does not have his life. If the sculptor could become a wax figure and take on the form of the wax figure and bring his life into the wax figure, would he resemble the wax figure, or would the wax figure resemble him? Surely we would say that the wax figure resembles the sculptor because the wax figure now has both the image and the life of the sculptor. Similarly, before Christ was incarnated and took on the form of man, the man whom He created according to His own image already had His image but not His life. Although man could not express Christ&rsquo;s life, man could represent Him according to His image.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL CREATED THINGS COHERING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>God not only made Christ the Creator of all things but also the Upholder of all things. All things were not only created in Christ; they cohere in Christ. Colossians 1:17 says, &ldquo;All things cohere in Him,&rdquo; meaning that all things subsist in Christ as the holding center. All things subsist as a regulated, orderly, and harmonious system because of Christ. They are upheld by the power of Christ. Christ upholds and bears all things by the word of His power (Heb. 1:3). All things are regulated and maintained in order by Christ. When we see the subsistence of all things, we should see the Christ who is upholding all things.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the existence of all things expresses the power of God. The Bible further shows that all things exist for the expression of Christ. God delights in all aspects of all things expressing Christ. Consequently, He uses the creation of all things to express Christ and the existence of all things to express Christ. Nevertheless, it is possible to look at the existence of a multitude of things and have a sense of God&rsquo;s wondrous might but not have a sense of Christ. It is natural to look at the things that have been made and have a sense of God&rsquo;s wondrous might, but it requires revelation to look at the things that have been made and have a sense of Christ. Those who look at the wonderful things in nature can praise God for His might, but those who look at the wonderful things in nature with revelation can sense the power of Christ and admire Him. If we have revelation and are in the light of revelation, we will see that all things exist today in order to express Christ and His power.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL CREATION BEING CREATED FOR CHRIST<br />
AND BEING INHERITED BY CHRIST</h2>
<p>God appointed Christ to be Heir of all things (v. 2), and God has given all into Christ&rsquo;s hand (John 3:35). All things were created through Him and unto Him (Col. 1:16), and all things cohere in Him (v. 17). Eventually, all things will be inherited by Him. He created, upholds, and will inherit all things. All things are out from Him and through Him and to Him (Rom. 11:36). In the past Christ was the source of all things, today Christ is the course of all things, and in the future Christ will be the end of all things. The source, the course, and the end, that is, the beginning, the course, and the consummation, of all things are Christ. Christ is everything to all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING ALL IN GOD&rsquo;S CREATION</h2>
<p>Christ is both the Creator and a creature. Christ is both the wisdom of God&rsquo;s creation and the power of God&rsquo;s creation; Christ is both the means of God&rsquo;s creation and the purpose of God&rsquo;s creation. Christ is both expressed by all creation and represented by man among creation. The beginning and end of creation are Christ, and the course of creation is also Christ. The beginning of creation involves His creating, the course of creation involves His upholding, and the consummation of creation involves His inheriting. Creation is out from Him, through Him, and unto Him. If we look at creation in the past, we will see Him; if we look at creation in the present, we will see Him; and if we look at creation in the future, we will still see Him. From beginning to end, creation is a story of Christ. In God&rsquo;s creation every detail and every aspect are Christ. God takes Christ as the center of creation and the purpose of creation; therefore, in God&rsquo;s creation Christ is everything.</p>
<p>We must never think that Christ is related only to God&rsquo;s redemption but not to God&rsquo;s creation, that He participated only in God&rsquo;s redemption but not in God&rsquo;s creation. Christ is in God&rsquo;s redemption as well as God&rsquo;s creation. Furthermore, Christ is everything in God&rsquo;s creation. We should see Christ in every detail and aspect of God&rsquo;s creation, because Christ is everything in God&rsquo;s creation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14; Rom. 6:6; 8:17-23, 29-30; Eph. 1:3, 5; 2:6; Phil. 3:20-21; Col. 1:14, 18-20; 3:11; Heb. 2:9-10, 14-15; 1 Pet. 1:18-20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S REDEMPTION ACCOMPLISHING GOD&rsquo;S PLAN</h2>
<p>God in His plan wants all things to be filled with Christ and to express Christ&rsquo;s glory, and He also wants a group of people to have Christ&rsquo;s life and glory so that they may be Christ&rsquo;s many brothers. God created all things through Christ (Heb. 2:10). Even though creation expresses the beauty, glory, and might of Christ (Rom. 1:20), it does not fully express Christ or His glory. God created man through Christ and according to Christ; hence, man is higher than all the other creatures. As the head of creation, man has Christ&rsquo;s image to represent Christ, and man can exercise dominion over all creation on Christ&rsquo;s behalf (Gen. 1:26). Nevertheless, created man has only the human life, not Christ&rsquo;s uncreated divine life and glory. Although man represents Christ in image and position, he cannot express Christ in life and glory. Created man has Christ&rsquo;s image and likeness but not Christ&rsquo;s life and nature. Apart from the divine life, man cannot fully express Christ inwardly, fully represent Him outwardly, or be His brothers. Hence, God&rsquo;s plan was not accomplished with creation alone. God needed redemption to complete His plan.</p>
<p>In order to hinder God&rsquo;s desire that Christ would be expressed, Satan came in to corrupt the man whom God had created. Satan knew that God&rsquo;s plan involved man, that man was the center of all things, and that all creation was focused on man. In his corruption of man, Satan tried to ruin God&rsquo;s central purpose in man as well as ruin all created things. As a result of Satan&rsquo;s corruption, man was filled with sin and death, and all things were made subject to vanity and brought under the slavery of corruption (Rom. 8:20-21). According God&rsquo;s righteousness and holiness, corrupted man and all things should have been destroyed. However, because of His love for man and all creation, Christ came to redeem man and to free creation from the slavery of corruption so that God&rsquo;s plan could be accomplished. Hence, God&rsquo;s plan is completed by Christ in His redemption (v. 23).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemption was according to His eternal plan. God&rsquo;s redemption was not an afterthought, as merely a remedy to solve a problem; it was determined from the beginning. Christ was prepared by God before the foundation of the world to accomplish redemption (1 Pet. 1:18-20). When God made His plan in eternity, He determined that Christ would accomplish redemption. Therefore, in God&rsquo;s view Christ was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION BEING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan was made in Christ and is carried out through Christ. God created all things in Christ and through Christ, and God&rsquo;s redemption was accomplished in Christ and through Christ. Nothing was created apart from Christ, and God cannot accomplish redemption apart from Christ. Every aspect and detail of God&rsquo;s redemption are in Christ and through Christ. God accomplished redemption in Christ and through Christ, and God enables man to partake of His redemption in Christ and through Christ. All the blessings of His redemption&mdash;including the forgiveness of sins, sanctification, justification, regeneration, eternal life, sonship, the redemption of our body, and entering into glory&mdash;are given to man in Christ and through Christ (Eph. 1:3, 5; 2:6; Phil. 3:20-21; Col. 1:14). A person is redeemed in Christ and through Christ. There is not one aspect of God&rsquo;s redemption that is not in Christ and through Christ, because God delights in Christ having the first place in all things (vv. 18-20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION BEING FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemption is not only in Christ and through Christ; it is accomplished for Christ. God accomplished redemption through Christ in order to gain men for Christ, that is, to gain men who would be partners with Christ in His life and glory. Furthermore, God accomplished redemption through Christ in order to restore all things for the expression of His glory so that Christ might have the first place in all things. On the one hand, the purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption in Christ is to rescue fallen man so that the man created according to Christ&rsquo;s image might have Christ&rsquo;s life and enter into Christ&rsquo;s glory to be the same as Christ. On the other hand, the purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is for Christ to fill all things (Eph. 4:10). When all things are renewed, the glory of Christ will be expressed through all things, and He will gain a group of redeemed people as His partners in His divine life and glory. This is what God wants to accomplish for Christ through His redemption.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION JOINING CHRIST<br />
AND HIS REDEEMED AS ONE</h2>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s plan, Christ did not accomplish an objective redemption that is apart from man and apart from the things redeemed by Christ. Rather, Christ entered into humanity in order to be joined to man so that He might accomplish a subjective salvation in man from within man.</p>
<p>The first step of Christ&rsquo;s accomplished redemption was incarnation (John 1:14). By becoming flesh, Christ was joined to man and thereby joined to all creation. He was conceived in Mary and born in Bethlehem, but His conception was not merely an individual matter. His conception represented God entering into mankind, into creation. Bethlehem is not just a place; Bethlehem represents the universe. Christ&rsquo;s conception in Mary was His entering into creation, and His being born in Bethlehem was His being born in the universe. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation was His coming into man and into creation in order to be joined as one with man and with creation.</p>
<p>Even though all things came out of Christ and were created by Christ and even though man was created according to the image of Christ, Christ&rsquo;s life and nature did not enter into man or into creation until the incarnation. In the garden of Eden Adam had Christ&rsquo;s image and likeness, but Adam did not have Christ&rsquo;s life and nature, because God had not yet entered into man to be joined with him. Even though man now lives in a wicked world, is ruined by sin, and has lost God&rsquo;s image and glory, man can receive God because God entered into man through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation for the accomplishment of redemption. Although Adam&rsquo;s perfect created humanity was defiled, Christ still came to be joined with man. This is the first step that Christ took in accomplishing God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<p>When Christ entered into man, He entered into creation, because man represents creation. By being joined with man, Christ was joined with creation. In the future in the new heaven and new earth Christ will be in man and will fill all things, and the glory of His radiance will be manifested by man, through man, and in all things. However, Christ Himself is not waiting for that day. In His incarnation He was mingled with man and joined to His creation. He was the Creator entering into creation to be mingled with man, as seen in the thirty-three and a half years that He lived on the earth. When Christ changed water into wine and fed five thousand with five loaves and two fish (John 2:1-11; Matt. 14:14-21), He was the Creator in creation and who was joined with creation.</p>
<p>The second step of Christ&rsquo;s accomplished redemption was crucifixion. On the cross Christ was crucified in the humanity of His creation. Being joined to man and, hence, to all things, He tasted death on behalf of man and all things in order to deliver them from God&rsquo;s judgment (Heb. 2:9). Furthermore, He terminated the old creation and delivered man and all creation from Satan&rsquo;s corruption (Rom. 6:6). Christ died on our behalf, and in His union with us He took us to the cross to die with Him.</p>
<p>The third step of Christ&rsquo;s accomplished redemption was His resurrection from the dead. In this step Christ brought all things that were part of Him through incarnation and that had died with Him through crucifixion into His divine life. In incarnation Christ entered into humanity in order for Him to be joined with man, and in His resurrection from the dead He brought man into Himself in order for man to be joined with Him. Through incarnation God became a man with the human life and nature, and in resurrection His redeemed ones received God&rsquo;s divine life and nature in order to become one with Him.</p>
<p>The fourth step of Christ&rsquo;s accomplished redemption is His second coming. In His second coming He will redeem the bodies of those who are joined to Him in His life, bring them into His glory, and free all things from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of His glory (8:17-23; Phil. 3:20-21). Then Christ will be expressed and glorified not only in the people who are redeemed and joined to Him but also in all things. His people will possess His image, life, and glory to be fully joined to Him and to be the same as He is in image, life, and glory so that all things may be filled with Him and express His glory. The issue of God&rsquo;s redemption in Christ is Christ&rsquo;s being joined to His redeemed people as one and to all things so that He may be &ldquo;all and in all&rdquo; (Col. 3:11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE FIRSTBORN FROM THE DEAD<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>In creation Christ is &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation&rdquo; (1:15), and in redemption He is &ldquo;the Firstborn from the dead&rdquo; (v. 18), that is, the first to resurrect from the dead. <em>The Firstborn of all creation</em> means that Christ is preeminent in creation; all creation was created in Him and came forth from Him. <em>The Firstborn from the dead</em> means that Christ is the first in resurrection; every person who resurrects from the dead will resurrect in Christ.</p>
<p>In creation Christ is the Firstborn in order to create all things, and in redemption Christ is the Firstborn in order to produce the church. All things were created through Him, and the church was brought forth through His resurrection. Christ is the first in creation in order to create all things, and He is the first in resurrection in order to produce the church. In relation to all things, He is the first in creation, and in relation to the church, He is the first in resurrection. Whether in relation to all created things or in relation to the church in resurrection, God has made Christ first so that He might have the first place in all things.</p>
<p>Christ is not only the Creator but also a creature, the Firstborn of all creation, so that He might have the first place in God&rsquo;s creation. Furthermore, Christ is not only the Redeemer; He also resurrected as the Firstborn from the dead so that He might have the first place in God&rsquo;s redemption. Hence, whether in God&rsquo;s creation or in God&rsquo;s redemption, Christ is everything and has the first place, because God delights that Christ would be all things, be above all things, and have the first place in all things (v. 18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING EVERYTHING IN GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Christ is everything in creation, but creation does not have His life and nature and cannot become a part of Him. In contrast, Christ is everything in redemption, and He can enter into His redeemed people to be their life so that they become a part of Him. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, Christ not only enters into His redeemed people but also brings them into Himself to receive His life and nature so that they might be joined to Him as one in life and nature for His expression.</p>
<p>Christ is not only the means and power of God&rsquo;s redemption, nor is He merely the beginning, the course, and the end of God&rsquo;s redemption. Christ is God&rsquo;s redemption. God&rsquo;s redemption is not only out of Christ, through Christ, and for Christ; God&rsquo;s redemption is Christ. Christ not only accomplished God&rsquo;s redemption; He is God&rsquo;s redemption. He is everything in God&rsquo;s redemption. One day we will see that the Redeemer is Christ, and the redeemed are Christ as well. The content of God&rsquo;s redemption is Christ, and the purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is Christ. Christ is everything in redemption, because God planned that redemption is for Christ to be all and in all.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN US</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 1:16; 2 Cor. 13:5; Col. 3:4; Gal. 2:20; 4:19; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29; Phil. 1:20-21; 3:21; Col. 1:27; 1 John 3:2</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING CHRIST TO BE OUR ALL</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:30 says, &ldquo;Christ...became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; According to the grammatical construction of the original text, wisdom is the sum total of righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; these three items added together equal wisdom. Humanly speaking, we do things according to wisdom. Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are God&rsquo;s way of doing things because they issue out of God&rsquo;s wisdom, which is Christ. God has made Christ wisdom to us as the way for our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption so that Christ may become everything to us.</p>
<p>God has made Christ our righteousness so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21). With regard to righteousness, the emphasis is on our justification and salvation in the past. Our justification is not merely because of what Christ has done; Christ is our justification. Christ is our righteousness so that we may be justified and acceptable to God.</p>
<p>God has made Christ our sanctification to be our sanctifying life, power, and living. With regard to sanctification, the emphasis is on our sanctification and victory in the present. Everything in a sanctified life, including faith, love, meekness, humility, patience, temperance, goodness, and godliness, is Christ Himself. Christ is our sanctification so that we may live a sanctified life and walk on a sanctified path. When we live out sanctification, we live out Christ.</p>
<p>God has made Christ our redemption so that our whole being, especially our body, may be delivered from the corruption of the old creation and may enter into the glory of the new creation by the power of His life. With regard to redemption, the emphasis is the redemption, the rapture, and the transfiguration of our body in the future. Hence, Christ is also the redemption of our body. Christ will not merely redeem our body; He will be our redemption.</p>
<p>Christ is the righteousness that God has given to us for our past, the sanctification that we are experiencing in our present, and the redemption in our future. When we obtain and experience righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, we gain and experience Christ. Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are God&rsquo;s way, His wisdom, so that we may fully partake of Christ as our everything. This is the central purpose of God&rsquo;s plan. This is His intention in creation, and this is the highest attainment of His redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD REVEALING CHRIST IN US</h2>
<p>God makes Christ everything to us by revealing Christ in us through the Spirit (Gal. 1:16). God does not give Christ to us, the believers, in a bodily form so that we can to see and touch Him only in an outward way. Rather, Christ became the Spirit so that He could be known and received in our human spirit. The Spirit reveals Christ to us and makes Christ real to us in our spirit. Christ enters into us and grows in us through the revelation of the Spirit. Daily the Spirit reveals the fullness of the Godhead and the riches of His life so that we may know, experience, and gain Christ in a deeper way until He is formed in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN US</h2>
<p>The greatest and highest blessing that we have obtained in God&rsquo;s salvation is Christ being in us. When we believed into Christ, He immediately entered into us (cf. 2 Cor. 13:5). This is explicitly confirmed in God&rsquo;s Word, and this is also proved and confirmed by our experience. After receiving Christ, some believers sense that Christ is in them as comfort and satisfaction. Some new believers sense that Christ is regulating them and forbidding them to sin, and others sense that Christ is enabling them to overcome enticements and temptations that they previously could not overcome and to endure sufferings and trials that others cannot bear. Some new believers also sense that Christ is leading and instructing them to walk on the proper path. Those who belong to Christ can sense His presence within them, especially when they are lonely, sick, or in danger.</p>
<p>Some people might say that the believers&rsquo; sense of Christ being within them is only psychological, not a reality. However, we should ask whether idol worshippers ever imagine that an idol is within them? Do those who revere the sages ever imagine that one of the sages is in them? Idols and sages cannot enter into us, because they are not living. Hence, men do not imagine or perceive that an idol or a sage is within them. However, Christ is the living God, and He can enter into us as the Spirit. Hence, we can sense His peaceful, joyful, bright, powerful, divine, and glorious presence. This is not our imagination or a psychological effect. This is a spiritual reality, which is as real as electricity in an electric appliance.</p>
<p>Christ is living in us. Even though our nature is corrupt, our flesh is filthy, our living is a failure, and our conscience is under condemnation, it is a divine fact that Christ is in us. Can we say that Christ is not in us? Second Corinthians 13:5 says, &ldquo;Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?&rdquo; Because we are in the faith and approved, we have Christ in us.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING OUR LIFE</h2>
<p>The main significance of Christ being everything to us is that He is our life (Col. 3:4). He is much more than the One who delivers and assists; He is our life, nature, person, and innate character so that He may become our content and our everything. In addition to having our natural human life, God has given Christ to us as our life so that we would no longer live by our own life but, instead, would take His life as our life and His nature as our nature. Consequently, Christ becomes us, and we become Him; that is, He and we are not just the same, but we are one. He is our inner content, and we are His outer appearance. He is our life, and we are His expression. Just as Christ has the life and nature of God and lives because of Him, Christ becomes our life and nature so that we can live because of Him (John 6:57). When we take Him as our life and live by Him, those who touch us outwardly sense that Christ is our inner content.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST LIVING AND ABIDING IN US</h2>
<p>Christ is in us as our life. This means that He wants to live in us (Gal. 2:20). We should not only take Him as our life; we should also let Him live in us. All the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ. Hence, when He lives in us, He abides in us and expresses all the riches of the Godhead from within us. This can be compared to the growing and spreading of a vine through its branches.</p>
<p>As believers, we all face a problem when it comes to Christ living in us. Even though we are saved, we still have our own views and concepts concerning how to be a Christian. Some believers think that a Christian should be humble and meek, and others think that a Christian should be loving, sympathetic, and generous. Other believers think that a Christian should have proper behavior and be righteous in everything. There are believers who think that Christians should be zealous to preach the gospel. Others believe that children of God should be simple and plain in their adornment. There are many concepts concerning how to be a Christian. Even though we are saved, we are controlled by our concepts, and we try to cultivate in ourselves what we think a good and proper Christian should be. However, being a Christian is not a matter of self-cultivation but of letting Christ live in us and live out from us. A Christian should have surpassingly excellent virtues, but these virtues are not the result of self-cultivation. These virtues are the issue of allowing Christ to live in us and to live out from us. Our virtues should be Christ, that is, Christ living out from us.</p>
<p>Self-cultivation is a natural human concept, but living out Christ requires spiritual revelation from God. For example, a sister who is irritable and has a bad temper often has a natural concept that she needs to be delivered from her temper. She does not know that God&rsquo;s intention is for her to live out Christ, not for her to be delivered from her temper. Since she is short of divine revelation, she will strive to improve herself according to her concept. Knowing that she is weak and unable to improve herself, she also will pray to the Lord for help. In her actual experience, however, she cannot improve herself, and the Lord does not answer her prayer for help. Instead, He allows her to fail until she is disappointed with herself and no longer tries to improve herself. At this point, she can receive revelation from God to see that being a Christian is not a matter of improving oneself but of living out Christ. God&rsquo;s desire is not for Christ to help us improve ourselves. God&rsquo;s desire is for Christ to live in us so that we may live out Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING FORMED IN US</h2>
<p>Christ is not only living in us but also being formed in us (4:19). Christ being formed in us is for the purpose of His being our life. He has been born in us through the Spirit, but He still needs to grow in us. As long as we afford Him the opportunity, He will cause the riches of the Godhead to grow and be formed in us, just as all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him.</p>
<p>The expression <em>being formed</em> does not only mean that Christ is in us to be our life so that we may have His nature and power. It means that He is growing in us so that all the riches of the Godhead may become our life and our living. Even though we have the human life and nature, God wants Christ to grow in us until He becomes our life and nature. God wants Christ to develop in us until He is fully grown and formed in us. In order for Christ to be formed in us, we need to know Christ as the Spirit, and by the Spirit we need to deny our self through the cross and live by Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is our life, He lives in us, and He is being formed in us so that we may be transformed into His image (2 Cor. 3:18). If we take Him as our life, live by Him, and let Him grow and be formed in us to become the essential element in every part of our being, we will be transformed into His image to be like Him in life and nature, including in our mind, emotion, and will. This is the principal work of the Spirit within us. On the one hand, the Spirit reveals Christ in us so that He may become everything to us through our knowledge and experience of Him. On the other hand, the Spirit transforms us into the image of Christ, from glory to glory, through our knowing, experiencing, and gaining of Him as our all. With Christ as the mold, the Spirit is working within us and regulating us from without to conform us to the image of Christ so that we may be like Him (Rom. 8:29).</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING MAGNIFIED IN US</h2>
<p>Christ is not only being formed in us; He is also being magnified in us (Phil. 1:20). To be conformed is to have a maturity in life such that everything of Christ becomes our inward element. To magnify Christ is to have a manifestation in our living such that everything of Christ becomes our outward expression. We need to let Christ be formed in us and be magnified in us at all times. Christ must be our inward life and our outward living; He must be our inner element and our outward expression. Our outward expression should always be a magnification of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOR US TO LIVE BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>God wants Christ to be formed in us and to be magnified in us so that we can say, &ldquo;For us, to live is Christ&rdquo; (cf. v. 21). When we take Christ as our life, live by Him, let Him grow and be formed in us, and let Him be magnified in us and lived out of us, we will be able to say that for us to live is Christ. Then our nature will be constituted with Him, and we will have His likeness and be completely one with Him. Thus, our living and our moving will be His living and moving; that is, our living will be His living again on the earth. Then we will be so one with Him that people will see Him when they see us. When He was living on the earth, He was one with the Father, and when people saw Him, they saw the Father. This is the meaning of Christ being in us. This is God&rsquo;s purpose in having Christ live in us. God wants all that Christ is and has to be fully expressed through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING OUR HOPE OF GLORY</h2>
<p>Christ may be our life and our everything, we may have His nature and likeness, and we may be able to say that for us to live is Christ; however, we still have not entered into His glory, and our body has not been redeemed and delivered from the old creation. Entering into His glory is still a hope to us. When our hope is realized in the future, we will enter into the glory of Christ; that is, we will gain Christ and enjoy Him in a deeper way. Hence, our hope is a hope of glory, which is Christ Himself. Now He is in us as our life and our everything, but in the future He will swallow up all the death in our being by the power of His resurrection life so that our body will become immortal and glorious. We will be brought fully into His glory, and He will be fully glorified in us. Today He is the hope of glory in us (Col. 1:27), but in the future He will be the reality of this glory expressed from us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR HAVING THE GLORY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We have the life of Christ in us so that we may be the same as He is in life and nature, but we do not yet fully express His glory; that is, we are not exactly the same as He is in our body and appearance. When we obtain the hope of glory, He &ldquo;will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo; (Phil. 3:21). Then our bodies will be fully delivered from everything of the old creation, and we will enter into the fullness and glory of the new creation. We will be like Him in glory from within to without (1 John 3:2), that is, in life and nature and in body and form. Inwardly we will have His life and nature, and outwardly we will have His image and glory. He and we will be completely the same in life, nature, image, and glory. He will be one with us, and we will be one with Him. He will be our ultimate enjoyment, and we will be the expression of His fullness. This is the ultimate consummation of Christ in us. This is the highest goal that He desires to attain in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Loving Him</h2>
<p>John 14:21 speaks of the Lord manifesting Himself to those who love Him, and verse 23 speaks of the Son and the Father making an abode with those who love the Son. If we want the Lord to manifest Himself to us and make an abode with us so that we may experience Him, we must love Him. Loving the Lord is the prerequisite to experiencing Him. Loving the Lord is also the ultimate basis for enjoying Him. To believe in Him is to receive Him into us, but to love Him is to have Him manifest Himself to us and make an abode with us in our experience. The Gospel of John reveals both our believing in the Lord and our loving Him. After we believe in the Lord, we need to love Him. It is regrettable that many people have believed in the Lord, but they do not love Him. He can manifest Himself to us only because we love Him, just as He appeared to Mary the Magdalene because she loved Him (Mark 16:9; John 20:1-18). Furthermore, if we love the Lord, He will make an abode with us so that we may know and experience Him. We can pursue Him because we love Him, we can experience Him through loving Him, and we can enjoy Him by loving Him. Our heart must love Him and be open to Him. May the Lord draw us!</p><h2 class="head2">Pursuing to Know Him</h2>
<p>In Philippians 3:8 Paul speaks of counting all things to be loss on account of &ldquo;the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.&rdquo; Paul suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse so that he might gain Christ. This indicates that if we want to gain Christ and experience Him, we must know Him, and if we want to know Him, we must pay the price to pursue Him. We must suffer the loss of all things, counting them as refuse. Because Paul pursued in such a way, he was able to know Christ and the power of His resurrection, and he was able to gain Christ in his experience (v. 10). If we truly love Christ, we will recognize the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. We will also despise all things in order to pursue after the knowledge of Christ so that we may gain Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Opening Ourselves to Him</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; Because we love the Lord and pursue Him, we should open ourselves to Him in order to behold His beauty. If we would remove all our veils and behold Him with an open heart, we will reflect His glory and be transformed into the same image from glory to glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Abiding in Him</h2>
<p>John 15:5 says, &ldquo;He who abides in Me and I in him.&rdquo; If we want the Lord to abide in us, we must abide in Him. Our abiding in Him is the condition for Him to abide in us. Abiding in the Lord means that there is nothing between us and Him and that we are in constant fellowship with Him. When nothing is between us and the Lord and we are in constant fellowship with Him, we will experience Him abiding in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Believing That He Dwells in Us</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:17 speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts through faith. Christ&rsquo;s dwelling in us is related to faith. The more we believe that He dwells in us, the more we will experience His dwelling in us, which will result in His making His home in us. When we love Him, seek to know Him, fellowship with Him, and abide in Him, we often sense that He is dwelling in us. However, there are also times when we do not sense His indwelling, even though we love Him and do not have any barriers between us and Him. At such times we need to believe that He dwells in us. As long as we love Him and do not have any barriers separating us from Him, His indwelling is a reality in our experience. Hence, we must believe in the fact of His indwelling us and ignore our feelings. Even if we do not sense that He is dwelling in us, we must still believe that He is dwelling in us. If we would ignore our feelings and believe that He dwells in us, we will experience His dwelling in us. Eventually, He will make His home in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking according to the Spirit of Christ&mdash;Obeying the Anointing</h2>
<p>Romans 8:9 says, &ldquo;If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&rdquo; This verse shows that Christ and the Spirit are inseparable. The Spirit of Christ is not only Christ&rsquo;s representative but His transfiguration. We experience Christ as the Spirit. When we live in the Spirit of Christ, we live in Christ, and when we walk according to the Spirit of Christ, we walk according to Christ. Therefore, if we want to touch Christ, experience Christ, and live in Christ, and thereby obtain Him, we must walk according to the Spirit of Christ and set our mind on the Spirit of Christ, that is, walk according to and set our mind on the Spirit. When we walk according to the Spirit, we obey the anointing in us, and we abide in Him and enjoy His riches (1 John 2:27).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Acknowledging That<br />
We Have Been Crucified with Him</h2>
<p>Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; In order to experience Christ living in us, we must see and acknowledge that we have been crucified with Him. The Spirit reveals not only Christ to us but also the cross so that we may experience Christ through the cross. Christ died on the cross for us, and the cross enables Christ to live in us. We experience the cross by the Spirit, and we experience Christ through the cross. Only when we stand in the position of our co-crucifixion with Christ can He become our experience. Only when we no longer live can Christ live in us. May we acknowledge our co-crucifixion with Christ and thus deny ourselves, handing all our rights over to Him and letting Him be our life and live in us. May we truly say, &ldquo;It is not longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Walking in Him</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:6 says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&rdquo; To walk in Christ is to act and live by Him. Since we have the Lord Jesus as our life and have Him living in us, we should no longer act or live according to ourselves. We should let Him live by taking Him as our life and walking in Him. This is the way that we afford Him the opportunity to be our enjoyment within and our expression without.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Putting On Christ</h2>
<p>Romans 13:14 says, &ldquo;Put on the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This means that we should put Him on outwardly so that He is manifested through us. If we live in Him and act and walk by Him, He will be manifested and magnified through us. We should not do anything that will prevent Him from being manifested through us. Just as we should be filled with Him inwardly, we should put Him on outwardly. Then we will gain Him and even become Him, both inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Awaiting Him</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we should await the Lord&rsquo;s coming, when He &ldquo;will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory&rdquo; (Phil. 3:20-21) and will lead us into His glory so that we may fully gain and enjoy Him (Heb. 2:10). As those who love Him, take Him as our life, live in Him, and magnify Him in our bodies, we should await His coming and love His appearing (2 Tim. 4:8). This should be our heart&rsquo;s desire and our living, as those who expect to enter into His glory and enjoy Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:9-11; 5:29-32; 1:23; 1 Cor. 12:12; Isa. 53:10; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Acts 9:3-5; Matt. 18:20; 28:20; Eph. 4:13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING GOD&rsquo;S PLAN FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:9-11 speaks of enlightening &ldquo;all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; The church was produced according to the eternal purpose and plan that God made in Christ Jesus our Lord. This means that the church was not an accident; the church came out of God&rsquo;s plan. Furthermore, the church was produced for Christ, not for any other purpose, because the church was planned by God in Christ. In eternity past, before the foundation of the world, God purposed and ordained to bring forth the church out of creation so that He might manifest His wisdom in the Son by expressing the glory and riches of Christ through the church to the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING A MYSTERY<br />
HIDDEN THROUGHOUT THE AGES</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:9 says that God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church was a mystery hidden in God throughout the ages. In eternity past God planned to gain the church for His Son. Before God created all things, He purposed to gain the church from among men for His Son. However, throughout the past ages, God did not reveal this matter to anyone. It was a mystery hidden in God and unknown to man. God did not reveal that He had created all things for the purpose of producing the church for His Son until the New Testament age (vv. 5, 9-10). Hence, the church that God wanted to obtain for His Son was His mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING BROUGHT FORTH IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>All things were created through Christ (Col. 1:16), but the church was brought forth in Christ. All things were made by Christ and are His creation (Heb. 1:10; Col. 1:16-17). The church, however, was brought forth in Christ and is a part of Christ (John 12:24; 1 Pet. 1:3), just as Eve came out of Adam and was a part of Adam, being bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh (Gen. 2:23). God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, opened his side, took a rib, and built the rib into Eve (vv. 21-22). Similarly, Christ was put to sleep on the cross, and His side was pierced to release His divine life for the producing of the church (John 19:34). Eve came out of Adam and was the overflow of Adam&rsquo;s life, and the church comes out of Christ and is the overflow of Christ&rsquo;s life (Eph. 1:23). Eve was constituted with Adam&rsquo;s life, and the church is constituted with Christ&rsquo;s life. Eve had one life with Adam, and the church has one life with Christ (Col. 3:3-4). Just as Adam could not find a helper to be his counterpart from among the animals of the field and the birds of heaven, Christ could not find a match for Himself from among the created things. Only Eve could be Adam&rsquo;s counterpart and be one flesh with him, because she came out of Adam (Gen. 2:20-24). Likewise, only the church matches Christ and is a part of Christ, because she was brought forth through Christ (Eph. 5:29-32).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING ONE WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>Just as Eve came out of Adam and was one flesh with him, the church was brought forth through Christ and is mysteriously one with Him. Adam was Adam, and Eve was also Adam because she came out of him. Similarly, Christ is Christ, and the church brought forth in Him is also Christ. Eve could be one flesh with Adam and a part of him because she came out of him. Likewise, the church can be one with Christ and a part of Him because she came out of Him. Only that which comes out of Christ can be joined to Him and be one with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ brought forth the church with His life so that the church could be His Body, making the church one with Him. This was foreordained in eternity past by God in His mysterious plan. God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to gain a group of people who have the life of Christ and who are the brothers of Christ so that they may be the Body of Christ. Individually, every believer has the life of Christ and is His brother. Corporately, we share the life of Christ and are His Body, expressing His fullness. God&rsquo;s highest goal is for Christ to obtain a Body so that His fullness would be expressed (1:23). An individual believer can express a part of Christ, but only the totality of all the believers, who possess the life of Christ in every place and throughout the ages, can fully express Christ. God has made us the Body of Christ so that Christ may gain a full expression. Although we are the many members who constitute the Body, this Body is Christ because Christ is its life, nature, constituent, and function. Hence, the church is the Body of Christ, and the church is also Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Concerning the church, 1 Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; This verse shows that the church is one Body with many members. However, the verse does not end with <em>so also is the church</em> but with <em>so also is the Christ.</em> This shows that the church as the Body of Christ is Christ, because it is His Body. Both our head and our body are us. We cannot say that only our head is us. Every person has a head and a body. The head and the body form a complete person. This also applies to Christ. He is the Head, and His church is the Body. Just as the Head is Christ, the Body is also Christ. Both the Head and the Body are Christ. If the Head is Christ, then the Body is also Christ. Just as the Head is Christ, the Body is also Christ. The Head and the Body are the corporate Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CORPORATE CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Bible speaks of the individual Christ and the corporate Christ. The individual Christ is the Lord Jesus. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, Peter received a revelation from the Father that He was the Christ (Matt. 16:16-17). The Lord Jesus later repeated that He was the Christ (26:63-64; Mark 14:61-62). After the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, the Spirit made it clear through Peter that God had made Jesus both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). These verses refer to the individual Christ, the Lord Jesus Himself. However, there are verses related to Christ in the Bible that do not refer to Him as the individual Christ. First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; In this verse the words <em>the Christ</em> include the many members who form the one Body; hence, this verse refers to the corporate Christ. The corporate Christ is composed of the individual Christ, that is, Christ Himself, and of the church, that is, all the believers. Christ plus all the believers form the corporate Christ. The individual Christ is the Head of the corporate Christ, and all the believers constitute the Body of the corporate Christ. Just as the Head has the life of Christ, the Body also has the life of Christ. The Head and the Body are the same, even one, in the life of Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is Christ, and the church that is joined to Him in His life is also Christ. The many believers who have His life are a part of Christ. Every believer is a member of the corporate Christ, the Body of Christ. Corporately, we are Christ, and individually, we are a part of Christ. The many parts of Christ together with Christ Himself are the corporate Christ, the mysterious, universal Christ. The universal, mysterious, corporate Christ is not limited by time or space and fully expresses Christ in the universe. Hence, the church is the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE FULLNESS<br />
OF THE ONE WHO FILLS ALL IN ALL</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:23 says that the church, which is His Body, is &ldquo;the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; The second half of this verse is a word of explanation, indicating that the meaning of the church, as the Body of Christ, is that the church is the fullness of the One who fills all in all. As the One who fills all in all, Christ the Lord is exceedingly rich, and His riches need a Body in order to be expressed. This Body is His fullness. If a person wants his riches to be adequately expressed, he needs not only a head but also a body. Only a head with a body can express a person&rsquo;s riches. This is the function of the church to Christ. As the One who fills all in all, Christ needs a corporate, universal Body for His expression. Christ is too rich; hence, He wants to produce the church as His Body to fully express His riches. This Body is the fullness of Christ, the overflow of His riches.</p>
<p>A cup overflowing with water is an example. Christ can be compared to the water, and the church can be compared to the overflowing water. The church is the overflow of Christ, the fullness of Christ. The water in the cup is the same as the water overflowing from the cup; likewise, Christ and the church as His overflow are the same. The fullness of Christ is His Body formed with a group of people whom He fills to be His corporate vessel. This corporate vessel contains the overflow of Christ so that He may be expressed in the universe. A man&rsquo;s body is his fullness, and the church is Christ&rsquo;s fullness. The life of my head is expressed through my body, and the life of Christ is expressed through the church.</p>
<p>Eve was the overflow of Adam, his fullness to express his riches, and the church is the overflow of Christ, His fullness to express His riches. When we see Eve, we see the fullness of Adam, his overflow. Similarly, when we see the church, we see the fullness of Christ, His overflow; hence, the church is Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>The church is not a human organization, nor is it a religious group. Strictly speaking, the church is not even a Christian gathering. The church is Christ; the life of the church is Christ, and its content is also Christ. Everything related to the church is Christ. The church is not Mr. Chang plus Mr. Wang plus Mr. Lee plus all the other believers. The church must not have the human element, because it is the overflow of Christ. The church is the overflow of Christ&rsquo;s flowing into you, into me, and into every person who has the life of Christ. The totality of the Christ who overflows into every believer is the church. Every Christian added together is not the church. Rather, the addition of Christ in every believer is the church.</p>
<p>A brother who knew the Lord said that when we subtract the element of Adam from every person who has the life of Christ and then add together the element of Christ in these persons, we have the church. This is an accurate definition. The church is not a group of people; rather, it is Christ. The church is not composed of people who have Christ but of the Christ in these people. The Christ in you plus the Christ in me plus the Christ in every saved person equals the church. The Lord Jesus Christ plus the church equals the mysterious, corporate, universal Christ. We must always remember that the church is Christ. Only that which is Christ can be a part of Him and be His Body. Furthermore, only that which is Christ can express Him and be a vessel of His glory. This is the church!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE INCREASE<br />
AND SPREAD OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, and Christ Himself; hence, the church is Christ&rsquo;s increase and spread on the earth. Many people think that the church is nothing more than a group that proclaims and announces Christ to the world. However, according to the Scriptures, the church does not merely proclaim Christ; the church is Christ. The church does not merely announce Christ; the church increases and spreads Christ. As the Body of Christ, the church is Christ. The church on the earth is Christ on the earth. For example, my body is me. When my body comes here, I come here. Because my body is here, it is possible for you to see me and to know me; hence, my body also proclaims me to you. Moreover, my body is my presence. My body can proclaim me and enables you to see and know me, because my body is my very self. What my body is to me is what the church is to Christ. The church can proclaim Christ on the earth for people to see Christ and to know Christ, because the church is the Body of Christ; the church is Christ. Hence, Christ goes wherever the church goes, and Christ exists wherever the church exists. If the church is in Taipei, Christ is in Taipei, and if the church is in Kaohsiung, Christ is in Kaohsiung. The church in every locality not only proclaims Christ but also is Christ. The church is His increase and His spread.</p>
<p>Isaiah 53:10 says that after the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, He would &ldquo;extend His days.&rdquo; How can the Lord Jesus extend His days on the earth if He was resurrected and ascended to the heavens after accomplishing redemption? This is possible through the church. After producing the church through His death and resurrection, the Lord continues to live in the church. We can say that the church is the embodiment of Christ, just as Jesus the Nazarene was the embodiment of God. We can also say that the church is God in the flesh, His second incarnation, just as Jesus the Nazarene was God in the flesh, His first incarnation. In His first incarnation God became an individual man by the name of Jesus Christ. In His second incarnation He became a corporate man called the church.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:15 says, &ldquo;The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth,&rdquo; and verse 16 says, &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; The church in verse 15 is the mystery of godliness in verse 16. The church is not only the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth; the church is also the great mystery of godliness, that is, God manifested in the flesh. The man Jesus was the union of God and man, the mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh. Likewise, the church is the union of God and man, the mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh. Hence, the church as the mystery of godliness is the enlargement of Jesus Christ, the mystery of godliness. The manifestation of God in the man Jesus has been enlarged to be the manifestation of God in the church. Hence, the church is the enlargement of God becoming flesh, the enlargement of Christ; that is, the church is the increase and spread of Christ on the earth.</p>
<p>In relation to time, the church is the increase of Christ, and in relation to space, the church is the spread of Christ. Christ ascended to the heavens over nineteen hundred years ago, but He still has not left the earth; He is still on the earth. On the day of Pentecost He was in Jerusalem. Then He went to Damascus, Antioch, Asia Minor, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe. He went to these places through the church and in the church. The church is the increase of Christ through the centuries and the spread of Christ in place after place. To this day Christ is still increasing and spreading. For two thousand years Christ has been increasing and spreading in and through the church. He is still being manifested among men on the earth through the church, His Body.</p>
<p>Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11), and the church is the firstfruits of Christ being all and in all (James 1:18). Christ fills all and is in all in the church. As such, the church is the universal Christ, a great, corporate, universal man. The universe includes both space and time. Hence, Christ in the church is a universal man, increasing in time and spreading in space. Christ fills time and space so that His glorious fullness may be expressed.</p>
<p>For two thousand years Christ&rsquo;s existence on the earth has never been interrupted. Church history shows that Christ has been increasing and spreading on the earth through the church, His Body. The church that belongs to the Lord, loves Him, and is filled with Him has continued to exist on the earth without interruption from the time of the ascension to the present day. This means that the Lord to whom the church belongs, whom the church loves, and with whom the church is filled has continued to exist without interruption on the earth. On the one hand, Christ has ascended to the heavens, but on the other hand, He has continued to exist on the earth without interruption from the day of His ascension. Whenever the church that belongs to the Lord and loves Him exists, there is Christ&rsquo;s increase. Wherever the church that is filled with Christ exists, there is His spread.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE UNIVERSAL, GREAT &ldquo;ME&rdquo;</h2>
<p>When Saul of Tarsus was going to Damascus to persecute the believers, he met the Lord. The Lord said to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; (Acts 9:4). This word puzzled and surprised Saul because he thought that he was persecuting people who believed in Jesus, such as Stephen, Peter, John, and James, people whom he could see and touch. But here was Someone, whom Saul had neither seen nor known, questioning him from heaven, saying, &ldquo;Why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; Hence, Saul was puzzled and asked, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; The Lord said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you persecute&rdquo; (v. 5). This response was an even greater surprise; it was beyond Saul&rsquo;s imagination. He had persecuted Stephen and the church, but when had he persecuted Jesus? Nevertheless, the Lord said that He was being persecuted by Saul. The Lord said this because He and His believers are one; He and the church are one. He is in the church, and the church is in Him. He is the church, and the church is Him. To persecute the church is to persecute the Lord, and to persecute His believers is to persecute Him. Hence, the Lord said to Saul, &ldquo;Why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; He wanted Saul to know that by persecuting Stephen, he was persecuting &ldquo;Me&rdquo; and that when Saul persecuted the church, the Lord&rsquo;s believers, he was persecuting &ldquo;Me.&rdquo; The word <em>Me</em> refers to a great, universal &ldquo;Me.&rdquo; This &ldquo;Me&rdquo; includes the Lord Jesus and all His believers in the universe. This great, universal &ldquo;Me&rdquo; is the universal man, the mysterious Christ, the corporate Christ, who includes Christ and the church.</p>
<p>The Lord showed Saul that He and the church are one, because the Lord wanted Paul to reveal the mystery of His oneness with the church. When Saul was called, the Lord revealed that the church is Christ and that to persecute the church, His believers, was to persecute Him, that is, to persecute Christ. From the day he was called, Paul was deeply impressed with the church&rsquo;s oneness with the Lord. This impression became the basis of his revelation concerning the mystery of the church. From that day Paul knew the Lord and saw that the church was one with Christ, that the church was Christ. Hence, to persecute the church was to persecute Christ and to touch the church was to touch Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SEQUEL TO CHRIST&rsquo;S BIOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>The Lord said to Saul, &ldquo;Why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; This word reveals that Christ and the church are one Body. It also shows that even though Acts reveals the move of the apostles and the church, it is really a sequel to the biography of Christ. We often say that the four Gospels are biographies of Christ. However, if we would see the significance of the word <em>Me,</em> that is, that the church and Christ are one entity, we would acknowledge that Acts is also Christ&rsquo;s biography. The four Gospels are a record of Christ&rsquo;s words and deeds on the earth, and Acts is also a record of Christ&rsquo;s words and deeds on the earth. The only difference is that the four Gospels are a record of the words and deeds of the individual Christ, but Acts is a record of the words and deeds of the corporate Christ, Christ in the apostles and the church. Although the outward instrument&mdash;the man Jesus Christ or the apostles and the church&mdash;may be different, the person speaking and acting is the same. The man Jesus Christ who spoke and did things in the four Gospels entered into Peter, John, and numerous other believers in order to speak and do things in them as the church, as recorded in Acts. Therefore, the four Gospels and the book of Acts are His biographies. The words and deeds of Jesus Christ did not end in the four Gospels; they were continued in Acts. Hence, Acts is the continuation of the four Gospels, a sequel to the Lord&rsquo;s biography. In Acts the Lord continues to move through the apostles and the church and in the apostles and the church.</p>
<p>In Acts the apostles and the church continued and extended the Christ in the Gospels. When we see Peter, John, Stephen, Paul, Silas, and many other believers in Acts, we feel as if we have met Christ. While Stephen was being martyred, he asked for the forgiveness of those who stoned him, in the same way that Christ had asked for the forgiveness of those who crucified Him (7:59-60; Luke 23:34). In Acts Christ was living again in Peter, John, Paul, and many other believers. Hence, when we read concerning the acts of the apostles and the church, we are reading a record of Christ. When we see the acts of the apostles and the church, we see the acts of Christ, and when we see the church, we see Christ, because Christ is moving in His believers, and He is the life and content of the church. The church is the Body of Christ, His continuation, and His extension because the church is one with Christ.</p>
<p>The believers in Acts were a continuation of Christ, they were His extension, and they belonged to the Lord, loved Him, lived Him, and died for Him. Furthermore, the martyrs who have lived throughout church history were also an extension and continuation of Christ. When we read biographies of the martyrs, we sense that they were filled with Christ. We sense Christ in the holy life that they lived and in the martyrdom that they suffered. Throughout the generations those who have stood on the Lord&rsquo;s side, maintained His testimony, and lived in Him have been His continuation. They were filled with Christ, because for them to live was Christ (Phil. 1:21). In whatever age they lived, they were Christ, and wherever they were, Christ was seen. Hence, the church is the place where Christ is on the earth.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE PLACE<br />
WHERE CHRIST IS ON THE EARTH</h2>
<p>Christ promised that He will be present wherever there is a meeting of the church (Matt. 18:20). He also promised that He would be with the church all the days until the consummation of the age (28:20). The church should always give people the sense of Christ&rsquo;s presence. The church has a problem if it causes people to sense zeal, excitement, or strength but not the presence of Christ. A church that fails to give people the sense of Christ&rsquo;s presence has lost the nature of Christ and lacks Christ.</p>
<p>A church that is normal must be full of Christ, full of the Spirit of Christ, and full of the presence of Christ. Those who are in the meetings of such a church will sense not only zeal, excitement, love, and faith but also something mysterious; they will sense Christ&rsquo;s presence. Those whose hearts are darkened will be enlightened, those who have no way to proceed will find a way, those who are feeble-hearted will find a solid standing, and those who are heavily burdened will have their burdens removed. Those who attend a meeting of the church may forget what they heard, but something mysterious will be added to them because Someone is present with them. Such experiences demonstrate that the church is full of Christ and is filled with the operation of the Spirit. When people touch the church, they touch Christ, and when they touch the Spirit and reality of the church, they also touch Christ. The church on earth is the place where Christ is, because the church is Christ on the earth today. Hence, if we are in the church, Christ must be here. We must not represent anything other than Christ, and we must not be anything other than Christ. We should be the reality of Christ for people to sense and to touch Him, His life, and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Since the church is the Body of Christ, His embodiment, the growth of the church should be the growth of Christ. The growth of the church is not determined by an increase in its strengths or merits but by the increase of Christ. The measure of the growth of the church is not determined by an increase in numbers but by the increase of Christ. God does not measure the church by any criterion or ruler other than Christ. His desire is for Christ to increase and grow in the church and for Christ to become the content and element of the church so that the church would arrive &ldquo;at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 4:13). Only the increase of Christ is the growth of the church; only the increase of the measure of the stature of Christ is the growth of the church.</p>
<p>I would ask the saints in all the localities to consider whether they have had an increase of the element of Christ in the past two years. Has there been an increase of the measure of the stature of Christ? I am not asking whether we have had an increase in love, whether our zeal has been intensified, or whether we have had an increase in numbers. My question is, &ldquo;Has the element of Christ increased among us? Has the measure of the stature of Christ increased?&rdquo; This is what God is after. This is His focus. God&rsquo;s work has been to cause the measure of the stature of Christ to increase in the church. God is expecting the church to grow to the full measure of the stature of Christ, because God&rsquo;s desire is for the church to be the Body of Christ, His fullness. Only the element of Christ can be the element of the church, and only the growth of Christ is the growth of the church. Only Christ is the reality of the church. Everything related to the church should be Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN HEAVEN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 4&mdash;5</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters we saw the past and the present in relation to Christ. In the past Christ was God&rsquo;s plan, the goal of God&rsquo;s plan, and the center of God&rsquo;s creation and redemption. In the present Christ is the life of the believers and the content and reality of the church on the earth. However, Christ is not only in the present; He is also in the future. He is not only on the earth; He is also in the heavens. With respect to time, Christ is the center of the past, the present, and the future. With respect to space, He is on the earth and in the heavens, and He is the reality of everything on the earth and in the heavens. Hence, if we want our revelation and vision concerning Christ to be complete, we must see Christ in the heavens and Christ in the future.</p>
<p>Chapters 1 through 3 of Revelation concern Christ in the church, and chapters 4 and 5 reveal Christ in heaven. Some Bible readers think that chapters 4 and 5 refer to the future. However, if we read these two chapters carefully, we will see that they do not concern things in the future but things that took place in heaven after Christ ascended. If these two chapters were not in the Bible, we would not know the scene in heaven at Christ&rsquo;s ascension. Through these two chapters the scene in heaven at Christ&rsquo;s ascension is revealed and presented to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;WHO IS WORTHY TO OPEN THE SCROLL?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>If we carefully examine chapters 4 and 5 concerning the revelation of Christ in heaven, we will see a special scene. A throne is set in heaven, and God, who rules the universe, is sitting on the throne (4:2). Around Him are twenty-four elders and four living creatures (vv. 4, 6). The four living creatures have no rest day and night, for they continually say, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming&rdquo; (v. 8). When the four living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits upon the throne, the twenty-four elders fall before Him who sits upon the throne and worship and praise Him, saying, &ldquo;You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, for You have created all things, and because of Your will they were, and were created&rdquo; (vv. 9-11).</p>
<p>In chapter 5 there is a scroll that is sealed with seven seals in the hand of the One who sits upon the throne (v. 1). In verse 2 a strong angel proclaims with a loud voice, &ldquo;Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?&rdquo; This scroll concerns the mystery of the universe. Who is worthy to open the mystery of the universe? The meaning of the universe, why it exists, where it is going, how it will evolve, and how it will end are a mystery, and this mystery is held in the hand of the Ruler of the universe, who is sitting on the universal throne. Who is worthy to open the mystery in the universe? This question was proclaimed in heaven, but no one in the whole universe could answer, because no one in heaven, on the earth, or under the earth was able to open the scroll (v. 3). When John saw this scene, he wept much (v. 4). It would have been truly lamentable if no one was found worthy to open the scroll and the mystery of the universe!</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY CHRIST BEING WORTHY</h2>
<p>In verse 5 one of the elders said to John, &ldquo;Do not weep,&rdquo; because &ldquo;the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David&rdquo; was worthy to open the scroll. On the one hand, Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. This indicates that He is a descendant, the seed, of Judah. On the other hand, He is the Root of David. This indicates that He is the source of David. He is a man because He is a descendant of Judah, but He is also God because He is the Root of David. He is both God and man. Furthermore, He won the victory by overcoming sin, the world, and Satan on the cross. He resurrected from the dead, overcoming death and Hades, and He ascended to the throne of God by overcoming the power of darkness in the air. The Lion of the tribe of Judah overcame everything that opposes God, everything that is out of Satan, and even Satan himself. Therefore, He is worthy and qualified to open the mystery of the universe. He is the center of the universe and the key to the universe. He created the universe, and He redeemed the universe. He solved all God&rsquo;s problems in the universe, and He accomplished God&rsquo;s plan for the universe. He opened the mystery of the universe, and He solved the problem of the universe. Without Him the universe would be a lamentable tragedy, but with Him the universe is like a wonderful, joyful song.</p><h2 class="head1">THE VICTORIOUS CHRIST AS A SLAIN LAMB<br />
BEING THE CENTER IN HEAVEN</h2>
<p>After the angel introduced the victorious Lion of the tribe of Judah, who opened the mystery of the universe, John saw a Lamb standing &ldquo;as having just been slain,&rdquo; who was in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders (v. 6). This indicates three things.</p>
<p>First, the victorious Lion who opened the mystery of the universe is the slain Lamb who accomplished redemption. The angel introduced the Lion who had overcome, but John saw a Lamb standing as having just been slain. He is a Lion toward His enemy, but He is a Lamb toward His redeemed. In the eyes of the angelic elder He was a Lion, but John saw a Lamb, not a Lion. The angel spoke as an observer of the scene, but John watched as a redeemed one. To the angelic observer of the scene, the One who overcame all the enemies was a majestic Lion, but to the redeemed John, the Overcomer who had ascended to the height was a slain Lamb. His being slain is His victory. He was slain to redeem those who belong to Him, but He also was slain to overcome His enemy. To His enemy, He is victorious, but to those who belong to Him, He is slain. The slaying of this overcoming One is a special mark that qualifies Him to open the mystery of the universe so that the lamenting universe can become a place of joy.</p>
<p>Second, the phrase <em>as having just been slain</em> reveals two aspects of one fact. On the one hand, the scene that John saw in heaven took place after Christ had been slain. Hence, the scene refers to things taking place in heaven after Christ was slain, that is, after Christ resurrected and ascended to the heavens. The mystery of the universe in God&rsquo;s hand was opened after Christ was slain, was resurrected, and had ascended to heaven. On the other hand, the death of Christ is ever new and to His redeemed in eternity He will always be &ldquo;as having just been slain.&rdquo; Whenever we speak of the Lord&rsquo;s death, we always sense its freshness, as if He has just been slain.</p>
<p>Third, the slain Lamb, the victorious Lion, is the center in heaven and the center of the universe. He stands in the midst of God&rsquo;s throne, in the midst of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the twenty-four elders in heaven. The four living creatures represent creation, and the twenty-four elders represent the angels. The fact that the slain Lamb, the victorious Lion, stands in the midst of God&rsquo;s throne, the four living creatures, and the elders indicates that the Lamb is the center of God&rsquo;s administration, creation, and the angels in heaven and in the universe. The mystery in God&rsquo;s hand depends on the Lamb, everything that creation expects depends on Him, and everything related to the angels also depends on Him. As the One who is God yet man, He was slain and has won the victory. He is the victorious Lion-Lamb. He overcame God&rsquo;s enemy, redeemed God&rsquo;s people, solved God&rsquo;s problem, and accomplished God&rsquo;s plan. He broke through Hades and ascended to the height. In the universe only He is worthy to open the mystery in God&rsquo;s hand, and only He is worthy to be the center in heaven and the center of everything in the universe. Christ is God yet man, He is the slain and victorious Lion-Lamb, and He receives universal worship and praise in heaven (vv. 9-14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST RECEIVING UNIVERSAL WORSHIP<br />
AND PRAISE IN HEAVEN</h2>
<p>When the Lamb took the scroll with the mystery of the universe from God&rsquo;s hand and opened it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before Him and worshipped and sang a new song, saying, &ldquo;You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). This song of praise is concerning the Lamb&rsquo;s being slain, accomplishing redemption, and being worthy to open God&rsquo;s mystery. Around the throne and the living creatures and the elders are ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands of angels (v. 11). These angels loudly praise the slain Lamb, saying, &ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing&rdquo; (v. 12). Then every creature in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, and on the sea and all things in them bless God who sits upon the throne and the Lamb who is the center of the universe, saying, &ldquo;To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever&rdquo; (v. 13).</p>
<p>There are two groups of creatures in the universe: the angels and all other creatures. Both groups of creatures are represented before God in heaven. The twenty-four elders represent the angels and were the first to be created in the universe. Because they are ancient and elderly, they are the elders in the universe. The four living creatures represent all the other creatures. The four living creatures are not only representatives but also leaders. If we study Revelation 4 and 5 carefully, we will realize that the twenty-four elders are not only representatives, but they also lead many angels in their worship and praise of the Lord. In addition, we will realize that the four living creatures are not only representatives, but they also lead all creation to bless the Lord. In chapter 4 only the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders worship and praise God, but in chapter 5 in addition to the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders, many angels and all creation worship and praise God and the Lamb. In chapter 4 only the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders are worshippers and praisers, and only God is being worshipped and praised. In chapter 5, however, the worshippers and praisers are increased to include many angels and all creation, and the One being worshipped and praised has also increased to include the Lamb who has been slain. It is not until the victorious, slain Lamb is in heaven as the center of the universe that the universal worship and praise of all things is fully realized. All things in the universe worship and praise God and the Lamb because Christ the Lamb has been slain, has overcome God&rsquo;s enemy, has accomplished God&rsquo;s plan, and has opened the mystery of God. The issue of Christ&rsquo;s being slain and overcoming is that God is worshipped and praised by all things universally and Christ is worshipped and praised together with God.</p>
<p>Revelation 4 and 5 show a picture of Christ in heaven. In heaven there is God&rsquo;s throne, which represents the central government of the universe. Around the throne are twenty-four elders and four living creatures, around the elders and the living creatures are ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands of angels, and around the myriads of angels are all creation in heaven and on the earth. Christ is the center of this scene, and He receives universal worship and praise together with God. God&rsquo;s purpose is for Christ to have the first place in all things and to be the center of all things. All the angels and every creature that is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, and in the sea and all things in them take Christ as their center and offer worship and praise before Christ to God. This is the scene in heaven when Christ ascended, and this is also the scene in heaven today. From Christ&rsquo;s ascension to the day that He comes again, the scene in heaven is of Christ being the center of all things before God and together with God receiving the worship and praise of all things.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN GOD&rsquo;S ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 5:7-10; 6:1; 7:2-3, 9-17; 8:1-6; 10:1-3, 5-7; 14:1-4, 6-7, 14-16; 17:14; 18:1; 19:7-21; 20:11-15; John 5:22; Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1; Matt. 16:27; 25:1, 14-19, 31-46; Luke 21:27, 36; 2 Cor. 5:10; Phil. 3:20-21; 1 Thes. 4:17; Rom. 11:26; Zech. 14:4-5</h1>
<p>Genesis reveals that God created the universe and governs the universe (1:1&mdash;2:25). Ephesians shows that God created the universe and governs the universe according to His will and plan (1:9-10). God&rsquo;s universal government is His universal administration. According to the Bible, God&rsquo;s universal administration has been given to the charge of His appointed Christ (Acts 17:31; Rev. 1:5; 5:5-6).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s appointment of His Son as Christ is His appointment of Christ as His Administrator (1 Cor. 15:24-28; Rev. 11:15). Christ is God&rsquo;s Administrator. Whether in the creation of all things or in the accomplishment of redemption, Christ was executing God&rsquo;s will (1 Cor. 8:6; Eph. 1:11, 20-22; Col. 1:16-17; Heb. 1:2-3). Government, however, is a matter of administration; hence, creation and redemption are different in nature from government.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament Christ was responsible for God&rsquo;s universal government after man fell and before He accomplished redemption according to God&rsquo;s will (Ezek. 1:26). The purpose of God&rsquo;s government at that time was to usher in Christ for the accomplishment of redemption. In the New Testament the focus of God&rsquo;s government is on the application of Christ&rsquo;s accomplished redemption. Christ is still responsible for the execution of this government. This chapter will focus on God&rsquo;s universal government after the accomplishment of redemption.</p>
<p>Many pay attention only to Christ&rsquo;s position in God&rsquo;s creation and redemption and neglect His role in God&rsquo;s government, God&rsquo;s administration. The book of Revelation reveals this role to us. Revelation shows that Christ ascended to the heavens after He accomplished redemption, took the scroll of God&rsquo;s universal government, and became a strong Angel to execute God&rsquo;s universal government by placing His feet on the sea and on the land (10:1-2). In this chapter we will see the position that Christ occupies in God&rsquo;s government.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN GOD&rsquo;S DEALING WITH THREE GROUPS<br />
OF PEOPLE ON THE EARTH</h2>
<p>Although millions of people have been and will be on earth from the time of Christ&rsquo;s ascension to His second coming, they are represented by only three groups: the church, composed of the believers; the Jews; and the Gentiles, the nations on the earth (cf. 1 Cor 10:32). God will deal with the people on the earth based on their relationship to these three groups. The execution of God&rsquo;s dealings with these three groups has been given to Christ so that He might have the first place and be the center in dealing with all people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Dealing with the Church</h2>
<p>Among the three groups of people on the earth, those who have the deepest relationship with God are the believers, who constitute the church. On the one hand, they are God&rsquo;s children, born of Him, and strangers on the earth (Heb. 11:13). On the other hand, they are obligated to serve Him and live to Him because they have been graced by God (Rom. 12:1). Their faithfulness in this regard will be judged one day, and a specific reward or punishment will be meted out to them (Matt. 16:27; 25:14-30). All the things that God intends to do in the believers have been committed to Christ, who has saved them and to whom they belong, so that He may be honored and glorified in all matters.</p>
<p>At the end of this age Christ will return to rapture His believers. Before the great tribulation Christ will rapture those who have been watchful and prayerful at every time in order to keep them out of the tribulation that will come on the earth (Luke 21:36). Before they are raptured, Christ is their hope (Titus 2:13); after they are raptured, Christ is their joy (Rev. 19:7). In addition, a hundred and forty-four thousand overcomers will be raptured to the heavenly Mount Zion as firstfruits to God and to Christ Himself (14:1). These are those who have loved and followed Christ. He is their goal; thus, &ldquo;these are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go&rdquo; (v. 4). In His second coming Christ will be the Bridegroom to His believers, the One whom they love and for whom they have been waiting (Matt. 25:1, 13). As the Bridegroom, Christ will marry His loving and overcoming believers as His bride. What a glorious and sweet goal! Christ will bring the overcoming believers to His marriage dinner, and He Himself will be the center of that joyous feast (Rev. 19:7-9).</p>
<p>At the end of the great tribulation Christ will descend from heaven on a cloud to rapture the majority of the believers like the reaping of a harvest (1 Thes. 4:17; Rev. 14:14-16). Christ will transfigure their body to be conformed to the body of His glory and to be with Him in glory, according to His operation by which He is able to subject all things to Himself (Phil. 3:21). Christ will rapture them, transfigure them, and glorify them to be with Him forever. Christ will become their unique, beloved, and exalted goal (Rev. 15:3-4). In the new heaven and new earth Christ will come down to the earth in glory with His transfigured believers, and He will be manifested as the believers&rsquo; center of glory (21:2). In eternity Christ will shepherd His believers, deliver them from suffering eternally, and satisfy them so that they may serve God. In God&rsquo;s dealing with the believers, Christ will be all to them eternally (7:15-17).</p><h2 class="head2">Dealing with the Jews</h2>
<p>The Jews are God&rsquo;s elect. Although God has set them aside temporarily today due to their disobedience, God will save a remnant of their entire race. In His salvation to them God has also given Christ the first place, making Him everything. Before the earth and the sea are harmed with tribulation, Christ as God&rsquo;s Messenger will seal a hundred and forty-four thousand sons of Israel who belong to God (vv. 1-8). This reveals that God has made Christ the Executor in preserving the sons of Israel who belong to Him so that Christ might be expressed.</p>
<p>When Christ comes to the earth, His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount will be split at its middle so that the remnant of Israel who are besieged by the enemy may have a way to flee (Zech. 14:4-5). Then He will come out of Zion in Jerusalem to be the Deliverer of the children of Israel so that their entire race may be saved (Rom. 11:26). This shows how God makes Christ the glorified center in His deliverance of the Jews. Without Christ the remnant of Israel has no preservation and no deliverance. Their preservation and deliverance depend on Christ. Christ is their all.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Dealing with the Gentiles</h2>
<p>Although, relatively speaking, the Gentiles have the least to do with God, His dealings with them are still executed by Christ so that Christ may have the first place and be expressed in all things.</p>
<p>Revelation mentions <em>another Angel</em> four times. The term <em>another,</em> which precedes <em>Angel,</em> indicates that this angel is different from the other angels. In these instances, <em>Angel</em> can also be rendered as <em>Messenger.</em> According to the description in Revelation 7:2, <em>another Angel</em> refers to Christ. Since 7:2 refers to Christ, 8:3, 10:1, 18:1 also refer to Christ; this is according to a principle of Bible exposition.</p>
<p>The eternal gospel is different from the gospel of grace (Acts 20:24). The gospel of grace is preached in the age of grace today so that people may repent and believe in the Lord Jesus (v. 21). The eternal gospel is preached during the coming great tribulation so that people may fear God and worship the God who created heaven and earth and all things (Rev. 14:6-7). During the great tribulation, Antichrist will particularly oppose God by persecuting the saints who remain on the earth, and he will set up his image for everyone to worship. Thus, a gospel will be preached to the unbelieving Gentiles to tell them to fear God, to not persecute the saints, and to worship the God who created heaven and earth, not Antichrist or his image. When Christ returns to the earth, He will judge the Gentiles who were on the earth during the great tribulation according to this eternal gospel, and He will decide whether they are righteous or unrighteous. The eternal gospel will be preached to them, and Christ will judge them according to the eternal gospel (Matt. 25:31-46). Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s preeminence will be expressed in God&rsquo;s dealing with the Gentiles.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN GOD&rsquo;S JUDGMENT</h2>
<p>God has given all judgment to Christ for its execution (John 5:22) and has given all salvation to Christ for its accomplishment so that Christ may have the first place, not only in His salvation to man but also in His judgment on man. We will now consider Christ in God&rsquo;s various judgments.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In His Judgment on the World</h2>
<p>The world is becoming more corrupt each day. Corruption brings in God&rsquo;s judgment; this is God&rsquo;s law. Revelation shows that this world will end with God&rsquo;s judgment. God will end this corrupt world with many judgments. All judgments will be carried out by Christ; thus, Christ will have the preeminence in God&rsquo;s judgments on the world.</p>
<p>The seven seals in Christ&rsquo;s hand in Revelation 6 through 7 are God&rsquo;s initial judgment on the world, and they are carried out by Christ. The seven trumpets in chapter 8, which are God&rsquo;s further judgment on the world, come from the seventh seal (vv. 1-2). These judgments are cast on the earth in response to Christ&rsquo;s offering up the prayers of the saints; they are God&rsquo;s answer to these prayers. Christ carries out judgment on the earth as God&rsquo;s answer to the prayers of the saints offered up through Him and with Him (vv. 3-5). The plagues of the seven bowls of the seventh trumpet in chapters 15 through 16 are God&rsquo;s final judgment on the world; this judgment is also cast on the earth because of the prayer of the saints.</p>
<p>In chapter 18 Christ announces God&rsquo;s judgment on the wicked totality of sin and evil, Babylon the Great. When Christ announces God&rsquo;s judgment, He is manifested as a Messenger coming down out of heaven, having great authority. His glory is splendid, and the earth is illumined with His glory (vv. 1-2).</p>
<p>Finally, in chapter 19 Christ executes God&rsquo;s judgment on Antichrist and his kings with their armies. This is the last group of rebellious kings of the world, and Christ smites them. Christ is particularly prominent in this judgment because He makes war to subdue and clear away all the powers rebelling against God on the earth (vv. 11-21). From beginning to end, God&rsquo;s judgment on the world is carried out by Christ. Christ is the main figure, the central character, in God&rsquo;s judgment on the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In His Judgment on the Church</h2>
<p>Because of God&rsquo;s salvation, the believers have been saved from judgment related to perdition; however, their life and work after salvation will still be judged for the sake of reward or punishment at Christ&rsquo;s coming back. This judgment will be carried out by Christ Himself at &ldquo;the judgment seat of Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:10). Believers should not only know that Christ has the first place in God&rsquo;s salvation and in the manifestation of God&rsquo;s grace today, but they should also see the prominence of Christ in God&rsquo;s judgment according to righteousness in the future. In both God&rsquo;s salvation and judgment and in both God&rsquo;s giving of grace and carrying out of righteousness, He wants Christ to be expressed and glorified.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In His Judgment on the People of the World</h2>
<p>The people of the world were created by God; thus, they are accountable to God and will ultimately face God&rsquo;s righteous judgment. Most of the people throughout the generations will be dead, but some will still be alive. The living and the dead people of the world will be judged by Christ, because God has already designated Christ as &ldquo;the Judge of the living and the dead&rdquo; (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1) so that Christ will be expressed and exalted in His last and greatest judgment on the world&rsquo;s people, which will also be His final judgment in the universe.</p>
<p>Christ will judge the living when He descends to the earth at His second coming. He will gather those who are still alive before the throne of His glory on the earth and judge them according to the eternal gospel that was preached to them during the great tribulation (Matt. 25:31-32). If they responded to the eternal gospel by fearing God and by not persecuting the saints, who are His brothers, He will judge them as righteous to enter into eternal life (v. 46) and to inherit the kingdom prepared for them &ldquo;from the foundation of the world&rdquo; (v. 34), which is the earthly part of the millennial kingdom. If they rejected the eternal gospel, He will judge them as evil to go away into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels, whom they followed, to be punished by eternal fire and perish eternally (v. 46). Christ will judge the dead people of the world after the millennial kingdom ends. He will sit on a great white throne and bring all the unbelieving dead throughout the ages before His throne to receive His righteous judgment, and then He will cast them into the lake of fire to perish eternally (Rev. 20:11-15).</p>
<p>In the judgments on the living and the dead, God causes Christ&rsquo;s glory and righteousness to be expressed before all the people of the world throughout the ages. In every aspect and detail of God&rsquo;s universal governmental administration, Christ is the center and has the first place. He is God&rsquo;s appointed Christ, responsible for executing God&rsquo;s universal administration according to God&rsquo;s eternal plan. In all His administration Christ has the first place, the glory, and the might, and only He is worthy of our praise and worship. To Him be the honor and glory and might forever and ever. Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM BEING FOREORDAINED FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>The kingdom, like the church, was foreordained by God for Christ. The church is mainly for the expression of Christ&rsquo;s life and glory, but the kingdom is mainly for the expression of Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory. In eternity past God foreordained that the church would express Christ&rsquo;s life and glory. Similarly, God prepared the kingdom to express Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory. Although the church is not mentioned in the Old Testament, God prophesied in many portions and in many ways concerning the kingdom that He has prepared for Christ.</p>
<p>Beginning with the patriarchs, God brought up the matter of the kingdom. When He called Abraham in Genesis 12, He promised to make Abraham a great nation (vv. 1-2). This promise was for the preparation of a kingdom for Christ. Hence, in the Gospel of Matthew, which is a record of Christ as the King, Christ&rsquo;s genealogy begins with Abraham (1:1-2). When the inhabitants on the earth rejected God&rsquo;s rule and dominion and followed the operation of Satan to establish different nations, God called Abraham out from their midst to form another nation that would receive His rule and submit to His dominion. Thus, God enabled Christ to obtain a kingdom on the earth as the sphere for the expression of His dominion.</p>
<p>In Genesis 26 God confirmed His promise to Abraham with Isaac, saying, &ldquo;To you and to your seed I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father&rdquo; (v. 3). When Isaac&rsquo;s son, Jacob, was on his deathbed blessing his sons, God prophesied through him that Shiloh, the Peace bringer, Christ, would come out of Judah to be Ruler of the kingdom, and all the peoples would submit to His authority (49:10).</p>
<p>In Exodus God through Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt and brought them to the foot of Mount Sinai. There God told them, &ldquo;You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&rdquo; (19:6). This indicates that God wanted the children of Israel to be His kingdom. In Numbers 24 God prophesied through Balaam, a Gentile prophet who had been hired to curse the children of Israel, that a Star would come forth out of Jacob and that a Scepter would rise out of Israel (v. 17). Both the Star and the Scepter signify the reigning Christ, the King of the kingdom, who would come forth out of Israel and have dominion to subdue the nations (v. 19).</p>
<p>During the reign of David, God obtained a kingdom that could express Christ&rsquo;s dominion on the earth. Hence, God promised David, &ldquo;When your days are fulfilled and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, which will come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. It is he who will build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever&rdquo; (2 Sam. 7:12-13). This reveals God&rsquo;s intention for Christ, the seed of David, to continue the throne of David. God promised to establish the kingdom and the throne of David&rsquo;s seed, Christ, forever. For this reason, the Gospel of Matthew refers to Christ as the Son of David (1:1; 9:27; 12:23; 15:22; 21:9).</p>
<p>In other portions of the Old Testament, God prophesied concerning Christ as the King and concerning the kingdom of Christ. In the Psalms David prophesied that Christ would sit at God&rsquo;s right hand until God made Christ&rsquo;s enemies His footstool (110:1). In Psalm 2:6 God declares to the kings of the earth, &ldquo;I have installed My King [Christ] / Upon Zion, My holy mountain.&rdquo; David also prophesied that Christ would send forth the scepter of His strength from Zion to rule in the midst of His enemies and would shatter kings in the day of His anger (110:2, 5). In Psalm 89:27 Ethan the Ezrahite prophesied that God would make Christ &ldquo;the highest of the kings of the earth.&rdquo; Isaiah prophesied that the Mighty God and the Eternal Father would become a child and Son as the Prince of Peace and that the government would be upon His shoulder (Isa. 9:6). Furthermore, there would be no end to the increase of His government and to His peace upon the throne of David and over His kingdom, which He would establish and uphold in justice and righteousness for eternity (v. 7). Jeremiah prophesied that God would raise up to David a righteous Shoot, Christ, to reign as King, act prudently, and execute justice and righteousness in the land (Jer. 23:5). Daniel prophesied that Christ would receive dominion, glory, and a kingdom from God and that all peoples, nations, and languages would serve Him (Dan. 7:13-14). Daniel also prophesied that at the end of the age Christ would come forth from the heavens, as the stone cut out without hands, to crush the kingdoms of the earth and set up His kingdom (2:34-35, 44-45). His dominion will be an eternal dominion that will not pass away, and His kingdom will not be destroyed (7:14). Micah prophesied that Christ would be born in Bethlehem of Judah to be Ruler in Israel and that His goings forth are from ancient times (Micah 5:2).</p>
<p>The prophecies in the Old Testament concerning Christ as King and concerning the kingdom of Christ prove that God foreordained that Christ would have the kingdom, that the kingdom would express Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory, and that Christ would be glorified through His reign in the kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">SATAN ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>With respect to the kingdom, Christ was born King of the Jews (Matt. 2:1-2; 27:11). Satan desires to usurp the kingship of Christ, and he is jealous of Christ. He used Herod, the governor of the Jews, to try to kill Christ. Under His power and sovereignty, however, God preserved Jesus from Herod&rsquo;s slaughter (2:1-23).</p>
<p>Christ was sent forth by God to preach the gospel of the kingdom, telling people to repent, for the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near (4:17). The Lord told the disciples that the nature of His heavenly kingdom is altogether different from an earthly kingdom, and He urged them to seek the heavenly kingdom (5:3, 10, 20; 7:21; 18:3-4; 6:10, 33). However, Satan hindered the disciples from understanding the heavenly nature of the kingdom, causing them to consider the Lord Jesus as only the King of an earthly kingdom; hence, the Lord could not lead the disciples to know His heavenly authority (20:21-23). Satan also stirred up the Jews to try to compel Him to be King through earthly methods (John 6:14-15), thus attempting to destroy the kingdom. Satan wanted the kingdom to lose its heavenly nature. Christ, however, perceived Satan&rsquo;s craftiness and overcame every hindrance. Christ never allowed His authority to become earthly and thus lose its heavenly nature.</p>
<p>Although Satan instigated the Jews to oppose Christ, God arranged circumstances that caused them to welcome Christ as &ldquo;He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel&rdquo; (12:13). Later, Satan instigated the Jews to bring this charge against Christ and sentence Him to death. When Pilate asked Jesus, &ldquo;You are the King of the Jews?&rdquo; (18:33), the Lord Jesus answered, &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling so that I would not be delivered to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not from here&rdquo; (v. 36). This means that His kingdom is heavenly, not earthly. Then Pilate asked again, &ldquo;So then You are a king?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;You say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice&rdquo; (v. 37). This reply indicates that Christ&rsquo;s purpose in coming to the earth was to be the King of the kingdom of the heavens. However, the earthly Jews who followed Satan rejected the Lord (19:12-15). In spite of this, when the Lord Jesus was crucified, Pilate wrote a notice that said, &ldquo;JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS&rdquo; and put it on the cross (v. 19). In this way the Lord was marked as the King of the Jews.</p>
<p>Satan caused the Roman soldiers to mock Christ as the King of the Jews, because he hates that the Lord Jesus is the King of the Jews (Matt. 27:27-31). He also caused the rulers among the Jews to ridicule Christ as the King of the Jews (vv. 41-43; Mark 15:31-32; Luke 23:35). However, God used various miraculous events at the time of Christ&rsquo;s death to prove that Christ was extraordinary (Matt. 27:45-54).</p>
<p>Satan instigated the Jews to kill the Lord Jesus and reject Him as their King, but God raised Him up from the dead (Acts 5:30), gave Him all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18), and exalted Him to His right hand (Acts 2:33), making Him Lord, Christ, and Leader (v. 36; 5:31). Furthermore, God sent the Spirit to testify to the Jews through the apostles that He had raised up Jesus, whom they had killed on the cross and that He had made Jesus the Lord, Christ, and Leader (vv. 30-32; 2:32, 36). However, through Satan&rsquo;s instigation, the Jews continued to hate the Lord Jesus and refused to receive Him as their King (Luke 19:12-14). Eventually, however, God will cause the remnant of the Jews to welcome the Lord Jesus and to acknowledge Him as the King who comes in the name of the Lord (Matt. 23:39).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST RECEIVING THE KINGDOM<br />
FROM GOD</h2>
<p>When Christ accomplished redemption, He fulfilled the legal procedure for obtaining the kingdom, and then He ascended to God and received the kingdom from God&rsquo;s hand. In Luke 19 the Lord Jesus compared Himself to a man of noble birth who goes to a distant country, to heaven, to receive a kingdom and then return (v. 12). On the day of Pentecost the Spirit testified through Peter on behalf of Christ that God had made Christ to sit at His right hand until He makes Christ&rsquo;s enemies His footstool (Acts 2:34-35). In 1 Corinthians 15 the apostle Paul testifies concerning Christ, saying, &ldquo;He must reign until God puts all His enemies under His feet&rdquo; (v. 25). Furthermore, Daniel saw in a vision that Christ went before God to receive the kingdom (Dan. 7:13-14). These verses present a great and important matter: In His ascension Christ went to God to receive the kingdom so that when the time comes, His dominion and glory may be expressed.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BRINGING THE KINGDOM FROM GOD</h2>
<p>Christ went to God to receive the kingdom, but He will not remain there; He went &ldquo;to receive...a kingdom and to return&rdquo; (Luke 19:12). When the time comes, that is, at the blowing of the seventh trumpet, Christ will go forth from heaven with His dominion, glory, and kingdom and will return to the earth to be manifested as the King of kings. He will break and shatter the nations on the earth with His might and destroy all rebellious powers (Rev. 19:11-16). Thus, the kingdom of the world will become His kingdom (11:15). Then His kingdom and dominion will be fully manifested on the earth (12:10).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM EXPRESSING<br />
CHRIST&rsquo;S DOMINION AND GLORY</h2>
<p>Daniel 7:14 says, &ldquo;To Him was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom, / That all the peoples, nations, and languages might serve Him. / His dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not pass away; / And His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed.&rdquo; This verse connects dominion, glory, and kingdom, indicating that they have a special relationship. In order for glory to be expressed, someone must reign, and in order to reign, there must be a kingdom. This is logical. A kingdom is a realm in which someone reigns, and glory is expressed through reigning in such a realm. Hence, the kingdom refers to the realm in which Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory are expressed. Although to a small degree Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory are now expressed in the church, this expression is weak, spiritual, and hidden; it is not visible to the physical eye. In the future the expression of Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory through the kingdom will be strong, solid, and visible. On that day people will see and know Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory.</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ (Col. 1:24); it is an organism that expresses the life of Christ. Although the church has the glory of Christ, this glory is mysterious and hidden. The kingdom is a realm in which Christ&rsquo;s dominion is expressed. The glory of Christ is not only in the kingdom; His glory is openly manifested in the kingdom. When the church is mentioned, we are reminded of Christ&rsquo;s life, but when the kingdom is mentioned, we should be reminded of Christ&rsquo;s dominion and glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM FOCUSING ON CHRIST AS THE KING</h2>
<p>When the kingdom is manifested, Christ will be &ldquo;the King of glory&rdquo; (Psa. 24:7-10). When He judges all the nations living on the earth, He will be the King sitting on &ldquo;the throne of His glory&rdquo; (Matt. 25:31-34). In the kingdom He will sit on &ldquo;the throne of His glory&rdquo; (19:28) and reign for a thousand years over the nations on the earth, with the divine and heavenly authority that God has given to Him (Rev. 2:27). He will also execute justice and righteousness in the land (Jer. 23:5). At that time the overcoming believers will be His companions reigning with Him (Rev. 20:4, 6). The remnant of the Jews saved in the future will be priests on earth, teaching the nations on His behalf (Isa. 2:2-3; Zech. 8:20-23). These nations are the sheep, those who heard the eternal gospel to fear God and who treated the Christians and Jews well during the great tribulation (Matt. 25:31-40; Rev. 14:6-7). These nations will be the people on the earth and will be guided by the Jews to obey and serve Christ. In the age of the kingdom, the time of the restoration of all things (Acts 3:21), Christ as the King of glory will be the center of everything, and His glory will be expressed through His dominion (Matt. 6:13).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM USHERING IN ETERNITY FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>The expression of Christ among men began with His incarnation and will consummate in eternity. As the Word, He became flesh and accomplished redemption on the cross. The cross produces the church, the church brings in the kingdom, and the kingdom ushers in eternity. Although Christ was expressed in His incarnation, this expression is not as adequate as His expression in the church. However, the church cannot express Him as adequately as the kingdom, nor can the kingdom express Him as adequately as eternity. In other words, in relation to Christ, the church cannot match the kingdom, nor can the kingdom match eternity future. Christ needs incarnation, the church, the kingdom, and eternity future. The kingdom expresses His dominion and glory in a fuller way than the church, but this expression is still not sufficient. His expression needs a realm that is larger and better than the kingdom. He needs eternity future, infinity, in order to have the fullest expression. This expression will be ushered in by the coming kingdom.</p>
<p>In the last days of the kingdom Christ will deal with Satan and the last rebellion of mankind to clear up all powers in the universe that oppose God (Rev. 20:7-10). Then He will deliver up the kingdom to God (1 Cor. 15:24). The kingdom will thus be ended, eternity will begin, and Christ will enter into His fullest and ultimate expression.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN ETERNITY FUTURE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:1&mdash;22:5</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN ETERNITY FUTURE BEING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S ULTIMATE GOAL</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we have seen Christ in God&rsquo;s plan, in God&rsquo;s creation, in God&rsquo;s redemption, in the believers, in the church, in heaven, in God&rsquo;s administration, and in the kingdom. In this chapter we will consider Christ in eternity. This is the last aspect of the vision concerning Christ.</p>
<p>Eternity is not related to time. To those who live in time, there is a difference between the past, the present, and the future. But to God, there is no difference because He is outside of time and transcends time. In our view, however, there is eternity past, which was before the creation of all things. From our vantage point the Bible even refers to a time &ldquo;before the foundation of the world&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:20), that is, before the existence of the heavens and the earth. In our view eternity future will begin after the millennial kingdom, which is when the old heaven and old earth pass away and the new heaven and new earth appear. When we speak of Christ in eternity in this chapter, we are referring to Christ in eternity future. Christ in eternity future is God&rsquo;s ultimate goal. All of God&rsquo;s work, including His plan, creation, redemption, administration, and kingdom, is focused on the ultimate goal of expressing Christ in eternity future. In creation Christ is the sphere of God&rsquo;s plan. In redemption Christ is the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s plan. In administration Christ brings in the kingdom through the church that is produced by His redemption. And in the kingdom Christ ushers in eternity future. Christ in eternity future is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>In eternity past the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;held a council of the Godhead. This truth is implied in the Bible. The Father desired that the Son would be glorified; the Spirit was willing to carry this out, and the Son was willing to express the Father. Hence, among the three of the Godhead a decision, a plan, was made to create all things in order to express the glory of the Son so that the Father would be expressed in the Son and through the Spirit. If, instead of reading only the letters of the Bible, we would study it thoroughly to comprehend its meaning, we would see that this truth is implied in the Bible.</p>
<p>In eternity past, before the heavens, the earth, and all things, including man, were created, only the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;existed. Nevertheless, there was a desire within the Triune God for the Father to be expressed in the Son and through the Spirit so that the Son might be glorified. In order for this desire to be fulfilled, God entrusted it to mankind within the sphere of the created universe. The Triune God created the universe and mankind so that He might entrust His desire to mankind within the sphere of creation. Hence, in eternity the Triune God also desired to enter into man in order for man to have His life and bear His image and enter into His glory so that God&rsquo;s glory would be expressed in all things in the universe through man (Gen. 1:26; Eph. 1:4-14).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE BEING<br />
FULLY ACCOMPLISHED IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal desire will be fully accomplished in eternity future. Creation was necessary for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal desire, but it did not accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal desire, because God had not entered into man, and man had not received God&rsquo;s life or entered into His glory. It was not until incarnation (John 1:14) that God&rsquo;s eternal desire began to be fulfilled directly among all things in the universe. Through incarnation God entered into humanity and was mingled with man. As a result, man in the person of Jesus Christ received God&rsquo;s life and nature and became one with Him. God is now working to repeat the story of His incarnation by entering into many people and being joined with them. This is based on His redemptive work. This work produces the new creation, which comes out of God and is in God. The new creation is the issue of God&rsquo;s redemptive work. Through redemption, He works Himself into redeemed humanity and thus transforms redeemed humanity into the new creation.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemptive work will continue until the end of this age. It will be completed when the old heaven and old earth pass away and the new heaven and new earth are brought in. The old creation does not have God&rsquo;s life or element. But through God&rsquo;s redemptive work, the new creation is filled with His life and element. Our old man in the old creation does not have Christ&rsquo;s life and element, but by passing through Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work, we become a new creation, possessing Christ&rsquo;s life and nature (Eph. 2:11-15; Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 5:17). God&rsquo;s desire will be fully accomplished in eternity because all things will be made new.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>In eternity future the old creation will pass away, and all things will be made new (Rev. 21:5). There will be no shadow of the old creation; everything will become new&mdash;a new universe with a new heaven and a new earth. On the new earth there will be nations, and the New Jerusalem will be in their midst (v. 24). The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the New Jerusalem (22:1). God in Christ will rule in eternity with the New Jerusalem as the center.</p>
<p>Orthodox expositors of the Bible acknowledge that the New Jerusalem is a city with symbolic significance. The New Jerusalem is &ldquo;the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God&rdquo; (Heb. 11:10, 16), a city that has been prepared for His redeemed as their eternal dwelling place and His habitation (12:22; Gal. 4:26). The city lies square and is pure gold, like clear glass, and the building work of its wall is jasper (Rev. 21:16, 18). The foundations of its wall are adorned with twelve precious stones, and on the foundations are the names of the twelve apostles (vv. 19-20, 14). The city has twelve gates: three on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west, and on the gates are inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel (vv. 12-13). Each gate is of one pearl (v. 21). In the city there is only one street of pure gold, like transparent glass (v. 21). This street is a spiral and leads from the twelve gates to the throne of God and of the Lamb at the center of the city. In the middle of the street the river of water of life proceeds out from the throne of God and flows spirally with the street. On either side of the river there is the tree of life that grows and yields fruit each month (22:1-2). God and Christ are the temple. This means that our place of worship is the presence of God and Christ. The city does not need the shining of the sun or of the moon, and there is no night there, for the glory of God illumines it, and its lamp is the Lamb (21:22-23, 25). Only those whose names are written in the book of life may enter into the city to enjoy the fruit of the tree of life and the water of the river of life (v. 27). These are those who have been redeemed throughout the generations. On the one hand, they are priests serving God, and on the other hand, they are kings ruling the surrounding nations (20:6; 22:3, 5). How blessed is such a glorious city!</p>
<p>According to its symbolic significance, the New Jerusalem is composed of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people throughout the generations. These redeemed ones include those in the Old Testament, signified by the names of the twelve tribes on the twelve gates, and those in the New Testament, signified by the names of the twelve apostles on the foundations of its wall (21:12, 14). The New Jerusalem is a glorious city constituted of glorious people. Hence, she can be the counterpart of Christ and the bride, the wife, of Christ (vv. 2, 9). The New Jerusalem is a building that is the issue of God&rsquo;s redemptive work throughout the generations. The materials that God uses for this building are Christ&rsquo;s life, which has passed through death and resurrection as signified by the pearls; God&rsquo;s nature, as signified by the gold; and God&rsquo;s glory, as signified by the precious stones. Pearls are produced from the wounds of an oyster. This signifies that the city is produced by the life of Christ, which passed through death and resurrection. This is our entrance. In the Bible gold signifies God&rsquo;s nature; this is our content. Everything of this city, including the street, is transparent, pure gold, indicating that everything of the New Jerusalem is related to God&rsquo;s nature and is transparent. Precious stones signify the appearance of God (cf. 4:3; Dan. 10:6; Exo. 24:10).</p>
<p>The city is of pure gold and the foundations of the wall are precious stones (Rev. 21:18-20). This means that the city is constituted with God&rsquo;s nature, and it expresses God&rsquo;s image. God&rsquo;s appearance is like a jasper stone (4:3), the wall of the city is built with jasper, and the light that shines forth from the city is also like jasper (21:18, 11). This indicates that the city bears the image of God; the light that shines forth from the city is the light of God&rsquo;s image. The city is the issue of the divine life that has been released and imparted through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection; it is filled with God&rsquo;s nature, and it bears God&rsquo;s glorious image to express the effulgence of His glory. The presence of God and Christ, the throne of God and of the Lamb, the worship and service to God and Christ, and the reigning of God and Christ are all related to the city. The city is filled with God, Christ, and light, and out of the throne of God and of the Lamb life flows forth for supply and enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD IN ETERNITY BEING WITH REDEEMED MAN AND<br />
BEING MINGLED WITH REDEEMED MAN</h2>
<p>In eternity God will be with redeemed man, and He will be mingled with redeemed man. The New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle of God with men, that is, the place where God meets with man (v. 3). This is the highest meaning of Emmanuel (Matt. 1:23). It is the complete fulfillment of the type of the tabernacle in the Old Testament. It is the ultimate consummation of the Word becoming flesh and tabernacling among men (John 1:14), and it is the culmination of the expression of God&rsquo;s presence with His people. In the New Jerusalem we will fully experience the reality of God being with man, and we will enjoy the blessing of God&rsquo;s presence. Today such experiences are mysterious and hidden, but in eternity future they will be concrete, evident, and visible.</p>
<p>God is with man in the New Jerusalem because it is the crystallization of the mingling of God with man. God&rsquo;s desire to be with man is not an objective desire; God does not want to be outside of man, merely coexisting with man. His desire is more subjective; He wants to be inside of man and mingled with man as one. This has been God&rsquo;s desire from the beginning. In eternity future the mingling of God with man will be fully manifested in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The number twelve is frequently found in the description of the New Jerusalem. There are twelve foundations adorned with twelve precious stones and inscribed with the names of the twelve apostles. There are also twelve gates made of twelve pearls and inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel (Rev. 21:14, 19-21, 12). The height of the wall is a hundred and forty-four cubits (v. 17), which is twelve times twelve cubits. The length, breadth, and height of the city are equal, each being twelve thousand stadia (v. 16), one thousand times twelve stadia. The tree of life in the midst of the city produces twelve fruits in twelve months (22:2). Except for the one throne, one street, one river, and one tree, signifying the unique God, everything else in the New Jerusalem is related to the number twelve. Twelve is three multiplied by four. Three signifies the Triune God, and four denotes the created beings. The four living creatures represent all creatures. Therefore, the number twelve signifies that the New Jerusalem is the crystallized product of God being multiplied, mingled, with man.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the book of Revelation the number seven is associated with the church (1:11, 20). According to the concluding words of the Lord in the seven epistles to the seven churches, seven is composed of three plus four (see footnote on Revelation 2:29, Recovery Version). This means that God plus man equals the church. Seven, however, is three plus four, not three times four. It is God and man being added together, not God and man being mingled together. The mingling of God with man begins when God is added to man, but it will be completed at the coming of the new heaven and new earth. Then the mingling of God and man will be fully expressed through the New Jerusalem. God will be in man, and man will be in God; God will be man&rsquo;s element, and man will be God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD AND CHRIST BEING THE CENTER IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>In eternity the outermost realm is composed of the new heaven, the new earth, and all things. The next realm is composed of the nations on the earth (21:1, 24). The innermost realm is the New Jerusalem. The throne of God and of the Lamb is the center of the New Jerusalem (22:1), where God and the Lamb rule in eternity. Hence, God and Christ are the center in eternity. According to the literal description of the city, God and the Lamb are the throne that is at the center of the New Jerusalem and rules the new universe. The Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are the temple in the city (21:22), indicating that they are the center of worship and service. God is the light, and Christ is the lamp shining forth from the center of the city and penetrating through its wall to illumine the nations on earth (v. 23). The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory to the city (v. 24). In the New Jerusalem God and Christ will be the glorious center of the universe. In eternity God and Christ will be the center of government, worship, illumination, and glory.</p>
<p>According to the city&rsquo;s symbolic significance, in eternity God and Christ will be in the redeemed ones as the center of everything. In the redeemed ones the throne of God and Christ will serve as the center of administration. God and Christ will dwell in the redeemed to be the center of their worship. God will be the light in His people, and Christ will be the lamp that diffuses this light. Thus, God in Christ will be the center of the believers&rsquo; illumination. God will be the light in His people, and Christ will be the lamp. God in Christ will shine in the redeemed and shine forth from them to illumine the nations so that the nations may walk in the light, the shining forth of God in Christ through His people. Hence, in eternity the new heaven and new earth will be the sphere in which Christ is embodied in a group of redeemed people. God will be expressed through Christ. Christ will shine forth through His redeemed to the nations, and the nations will live in the light of this glory.</p>
<p>In eternity future God is the light, Christ is the lamp, and the New Jerusalem shines forth the light in the lamp so that the nations may walk in its light. God is in Christ to be expressed through Christ so that Christ may be glorified, just as electricity in an electric lamp is expressed through the lamp. In the New Jerusalem God is the light, but its lamp is Christ. God is in Christ in order to be expressed through Christ. The light in the New Jerusalem is God as light shining through Christ. The New Jerusalem shines forth the light that is in Christ. Hence, Christ is the content and expression of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Although God is the center of the New Jerusalem, He is in Christ. Christ is the expression of God. Christ is the content of the New Jerusalem at its center and the expression of the New Jerusalem in its circumference. God is in Christ, and Christ is the content and expression of the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in the New Jerusalem Christ is God as well as the city. Christ contains God as the content and expression of the city to be manifested in the universe. Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11).</p>
<p>God is in Christ, Christ is in His redeemed people, and the redeemed people shine forth Christ to the nations and express the glory of Christ to creation. This is the condition and scene in eternity. Today we are the firstfruits of such a condition (James 1:18). God is in Christ, Christ is in us, and we live out Christ for His expression and glorification. This is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and this should be our living today.</p><h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD CONCERNING CHRIST</h2>
<p>In these chapters we have seen that Christ is all and in all. Christ is all and in all in God&rsquo;s plan, in creation, in redemption, in the believers, in the church, in God&rsquo;s administration, in the kingdom, in heaven, and in eternity. Christ is all. He is God who planned all things, and He is God&rsquo;s plan. He is the Creator, and He is a creature. He is the Redeemer, and He is redemption to the believers. He accomplishes redemption, and He enters into the believers as redemption. He is our redemption. As the Head, He is life to His people, and He is life to the church as the Body (Col. 1:18; 3:4), the believers who are His members (1 Cor. 6:15; Eph. 1:23). Hence, the believers are Christ, and the church is also Christ. He is the Administrator in God&rsquo;s universe and the King in God&rsquo;s kingdom (Rev. 11:15). He is both the dominion and the glory of the heavens. He is the center and the expression of eternity. He is all! He is the way, the reality, and the life (John 14:6). He is the truth (8:32, 36). He is the light and the power (1:4; 1 Cor. 1:24). He is the bread of life and the eternal, living water (John 6:35; 7:38). He is righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). He is our consolation and our rest (Luke 2:25; Phil. 2:1; Matt. 11:28). He is our trust and our hope (Col. 1:27). He is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End (Rev. 21:6). He is everything in the universe. There is life in the universe because He is the life. There is light in the universe because He is the light. There are meekness and humility in the universe because He is meekness and humility. There are love and patience in the universe because He is love and patience. He is the reality of everything in the universe. Everything in the universe is false and vain without Him, but with Him everything is true and real (Col. 2:17).</p>
<p>Christ is everything; everything is in Him and with Him. God is in Christ. God&rsquo;s plan and work are in Him. God&rsquo;s creation and redemption depend on Him. The believers and the church are begotten in Him, and He upholds all things. We cannot know God or His plan apart from Christ. Apart from Christ there is no creation or redemption. Apart from Christ there are no Christians and no church. Apart from Christ there is no administration or kingdom. All these matters are focused on Christ and take Him as their center and goal. Christ is their source and consummation. All these matters are in Christ and are headed up in Him. God is in Christ, and man is also in Him. The Creator is in Christ, and the creatures are also in Him. The Redeemer is in Christ, and the redeemed people are also in Him. Everything is in Christ, and He bears everything. He comprises all and upholds all. The whole universe, all creation, man, and God are focused on Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is outside of time, yet He also lived in time. He transcends space, but He was also limited by space. He exists in eternity as well as in the present. He is in heaven as well as on earth. In the past He was in Peter and Paul, yet He is also in us. We worship Him as the One in heaven, and we also sense that He is in us. We praise Him for His living in the land of Judea long ago, but we also sense that He is with us. He fills time, space, and matter. This is the Christ of God, our glorious Lord. One day all things will be filled with Him and will express Him. He will be magnified in all things and will occupy the first place in all things (1:18).</p>
<p>Christ has entered into us to make us the firstfruits of His expression to bring in this glorious day. If we see this, our Christian life will be changed. We will focus on Christ as our center and goal and live in Him so that He would be all and in all. This is the goal that God wants to attain, and this should be our pursuit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PLACE OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:7-9; 1 Pet. 1:20; Rev. 21:22-23; Heb. 9:14; Luke 24:25-27, 44-46; 1 Cor. 2:2; 1:23, 18; Gal. 5:11</h1>
<p>This book is divided into two sections. The first ten chapters of this book are the first section and are concerning Christ. With this chapter we will begin the second section concerning the cross of Christ. According to the revelation of the Bible, the cross of Christ refers to the death of Christ. This is a very significant matter that occupies a special place in the Bible. In order to know the significance of the cross, we will consider various aspects of the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING PLANNED BY GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:7 says, &ldquo;In whom we have redemption through His blood...according to the riches of His grace.&rdquo; Speaking of God&rsquo;s beloved Son, this verse says that we have redemption through His blood according to the riches of His grace. By His abounding grace God made known to us &ldquo;the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). On the cross and through His blood Christ accomplished the redemption that was planned according to God&rsquo;s good pleasure. The cross was planned by God according to the good pleasure of His will. Knowing the cross enables us to know the mystery of God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Other than Christ Himself, nothing in God&rsquo;s plan has a higher place than the cross. Christ and the cross are at the center of God&rsquo;s plan. Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s purpose, and the cross is the center of God&rsquo;s procedure. Christ is the purpose of God&rsquo;s plan, and the cross is the procedure of God&rsquo;s plan. Everything in God&rsquo;s plan takes Christ as its purpose and is carried out for Christ, and everything in God&rsquo;s plan takes the cross as its procedure and is carried out through the cross. Hence, Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s purpose in His plan, and the cross is the center of the procedure in God&rsquo;s plan. God has determined to do everything in His plan in Christ, and God has determined to do everything in His plan through the cross. Without Christ, God&rsquo;s plan has no purpose, and without the cross, God&rsquo;s plan has no procedure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING ETERNAL</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is eternal. Because the cross is part of God&rsquo;s plan, the cross is not only a matter in time; it has an eternal element. Many people think of the cross, which is God&rsquo;s solution for man&rsquo;s salvation, as a historical event in time. They think that the Lord Jesus came to establish a way of salvation after man sinned and deserved to perish. Although such a thought does not seem wrong, it is far from the revelation of the Bible because it makes the cross an afterthought in the carrying out of God&rsquo;s plan in relation to the problem of the fall. However, the Bible reveals that the cross was planned and determined by God in eternity (1 Pet. 1:20). Before man sinned and fell, or rather, before man was created, before the universe was created, and before time came into being, that is, in eternity without beginning, God planned the redemption of the cross according to His good pleasure and His foreknowledge. The cross is part of God&rsquo;s eternal plan, not an afterthought. The cross was planned by God in eternity but fulfilled in time. For this reason, the Bible says that Christ, who accomplished redemption on the cross, was prepared by God before the foundation of the world. Long before the foundation of the world, before anything had come into being, God in His eternal plan determined that Christ would carry out the way of salvation on the cross. The cross was determined before the foundation of the world in eternity past.</p>
<p>The cross comes out of eternity past, and it will continue to exist in eternity future. Christ is in heaven as the Lamb who was slain (Rev. 5:6), and in eternity future He will still be the Lamb who was slain (13:8). Christ being called the Lamb indicates that He was slain, and being slain is a matter of the cross. Therefore, Christ as the Lamb should remind us of His cross. In eternity future Christ will still be the Lamb, and He will still be called the Lamb. This indicates that in eternity future the efficacy of His cross will continue, and we will continue to remember the cross.</p>
<p>In eternity future the relationship between God and His redeemed ones will be based on Christ&rsquo;s status as the Lamb. Thus, in eternity future the efficacy of His cross will remain between God and those who have been redeemed. The efficacy of His cross will not only be remembered by us but also enjoyed by us. In eternity future God will be with us as the light of life and everything in the Lamb who was slain (21:22-23). We will enjoy the fullness of God and express the glory of God in the Lamb who was slain. His death on the cross is eternally efficacious in us and between God and us. As a result, we will have an eternal relationship with God. Through the eternal Spirit, Christ offered Himself on the cross without blemish to God (Heb. 9:14). Hence, the accomplishments of His cross are eternal, not temporary. The efficacy of the cross is eternal; it is not limited to time.</p>
<p>The cross is eternal and belongs to eternity. The cross was planned in eternity past and will remain in eternity future. The place of the cross in eternity speaks of the significance of the cross. We must not diminish the significance of the cross by considering the cross to be something transient, something related merely to time.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING THE CENTER<br />
OF THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECIES</h2>
<p>In eternity God planned and determined that the cross would be fulfilled in time. Hence, even before the time of its fulfillment, God used types, figures, and prophecies in many portions of the Old Testament to reveal the cross in a clear and detailed way.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament types and prophecies God not only revealed the coming Christ, but God also spoke of the work of the cross that would be fulfilled through Christ. The Old Testament reveals Christ before His incarnation, and it also presents the cross in a definite way. The Old Testament is full of Christ, and it is also full of the cross.</p>
<p>For example, the sacrifice in the garden of Eden (Gen. 3:21), the sheep offered by Abel (4:4), the sacrifices offered by the patriarchs (8:20; 12:7; 13:18; 22:13; 26:25), and the passover lamb (Exo. 12; cf. 1 Cor. 5:7) all portray the work of the cross. The altar and the sacrifices (cf. Heb. 13:10), the smitten rock (Exo. 17:6; cf. 1 Cor. 10:4), and the bronze serpent (Num. 21:9; cf. John 3:14) are further examples of types related to the cross. Even the hanging of a convicted person on a tree is a type that portrays the cross (Deut. 21:22). Genesis 3:15, Psalm 22:1 and 6-18, Isaiah 53:4-10, and Zechariah 12:10 all speak of the cross.</p>
<p>If we understand the Bible, we will see the importance of the cross through the Old Testament types and prophecies. Everything that God intends to fulfill and obtain, everything that He promises to His chosen ones, and everything that He gives to His people involve the work of the cross. Everything is achieved through the cross. Christ and the cross are at the center of the Old Testament prophecies: Christ is the purpose, and the cross is the procedure. In order to understand the prophecies in the Old Testament, we must know both Christ and the cross. Christ and the cross are the key to the prophecies in the Old Testament. If we know Christ and His cross, we will have the secret to understanding the prophecies in the Old Testament. This is what the Lord Jesus revealed to His disciples after His resurrection (Luke 24:13-27, 44-46).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING THE CENTER<br />
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT REVELATION</h2>
<p>The Old Testament ushers in the New Testament, and the New Testament fulfills the Old Testament. The Old Testament prophecies take Christ and His cross as the center, and the New Testament revelation also takes Christ and His cross as the center. The New Testament emphatically speaks of Christ being the center of everything, but it also speaks just as emphatically concerning the cross. The four Gospels present Christ and the cross. The four Gospels portray Christ to us, and they also portray the work that He accomplished on the cross. If we want to understand the four Gospels, we must know both Christ and the cross.</p>
<p>The book of Acts testifies concerning the resurrected and ascended Christ and concerning His cross. Through the cross Christ was ushered into resurrection and ascension to become the resurrected and ascended Christ. In order to know such a Christ, we must see His cross, and we must know Him through His cross. Christ is the goal in the book of Acts, and His cross is also the basis of the book of Acts.</p>
<p>The Epistles place equal emphasis on Christ and His cross. Paul said, &ldquo;I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:2). Paul preached nothing other than &ldquo;Christ crucified&rdquo; (1:22-23). He did not present signs for the Jews or wisdom for the Greeks. Instead, Paul considered Christ and the cross of Christ as the power of God (vv. 24, 18). Christ and the cross are the center of Paul&rsquo;s speaking. Paul was hated by people because he preached the cross of Christ (Gal. 5:11). Paul was used by God, and his message was powerful because he preached the cross of Christ. Peter and John also presented Christ, who accomplished redemption, and His cross as the center of their speaking (1 Pet. 1:3, 18-19; 2:21-24; 3:18; 4:1-2; 1 John 1:7; 3:16; 4:10; 5:6). In order to understand the Epistles, we must know Christ and His cross. We can touch the reality in the Epistles only by seeing Christ and His cross.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation is a &ldquo;revelation of Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1:1). This book opens a heavenly veil to reveal Christ; therefore, it is a particular book concerning Christ. However, Revelation reveals that the Christ who has received glory in heaven and for eternity is the Lamb who has been slain (5:6). When Revelation speaks of the status of Christ, it refers to Him as the Lamb standing as having just been slain. The title <em>Lamb</em> reminds us of the cross of Christ and turns our attention to the cross of Christ. Hence, Revelation also takes Christ as its center and the cross of Christ as its focus.</p>
<p>Both Christ and His cross are the center of the New Testament revelation. If we want to know the New Testament revelation, we must know not only Christ but also the cross. Christ and the cross are the secret to understanding the New Testament revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING THE CENTER<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>The cross occupies an important and central place in the Old Testament prophecies and in the New Testament revelation because the cross is the center of God&rsquo;s work of redemption. God&rsquo;s work of redemption was carried out by Christ and through the cross. Just as there is no redemption apart from Christ, there is also no redemption apart from the cross. Both Christ and the cross are the center of God&rsquo;s redemption. Forgiveness, cleansing, justification, sanctification, reconciliation, regeneration, eternal life, emancipation, and every other spiritual blessing in God&rsquo;s redemption are in Christ and through the cross (Eph. 1:3). In order to obtain and experience these spiritual blessings, we must know Christ and His cross. We can obtain these blessings only in Christ, and we can experience them only through the cross.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE POSITIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 12:24; Gen. 2:21-24; Eph. 5:25, 31-32; Luke 12:49-50</h1>
<p>In this chapter and in the following two chapters we will consider the function of the cross. In other words, we will consider the purpose of the cross and what the cross accomplished. The function of the cross has a positive aspect and a negative aspect. On the negative side, the cross solves God&rsquo;s problem, and on the positive side, the cross fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose. Although we generally look at the negative aspect of a matter first and then look at the positive aspect, we will begin with God&rsquo;s purpose to release and transmit life, which is the positive function of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE BEING<br />
TO RELEASE HIS ETERNAL LIFE</h2>
<p>According to the revelation in the Bible, God&rsquo;s purpose is to release and impart His life into a group of people created by Him for this purpose. This purpose was determined in God in eternity according to His good pleasure (Eph. 1:5, 9). In order to fulfill this purpose, God made an eternal plan according to His will. Hence, His purpose is the purpose of His eternal plan.</p>
<p>The life of God is the eternal life. In the Bible the word <em>eternal</em> is related not only to time, having no beginning and no ending, but it is related also to measurement, being unlimited and immeasurable. Thus, when the Bible speaks of the eternal life of God (John 3:16), it is referring to the life that is not only without beginning and without ending but is also unlimited and immeasurable. In eternity it pleased God to release His unlimited life from within Himself into many people to be their life. This purpose pleases God because He desires to produce brothers for His Son with His life so that Christ would be glorified, and He would be expressed in Christ. The Bible reveals that God will fulfill this eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELEASE AND TRANSMISSION<br />
OF LIFE THROUGH DEATH BEING A LAW</h2>
<p>Life is released and transmitted through death. This is an important law revealed in the Bible: If a seed does not die, it cannot release its life, nor can it transmit its life to other seeds. Both plant life and animal life operate according to this law. If a silkworm does not pass through a death-like sleep, it will not turn into a moth, and it will not be able to release or transmit its life to produce more silkworms. If the shell of a chicken egg is not broken, a chicken cannot be produced, and it will not be able to release and transmit its life to produce more chickens.</p>
<p>In order for the life element of any living creature to enter as nutrients into human beings or into other animals, the living creature must die. God ordained that man would eat herbs, grains, and fruit as food for his sustenance (Gen. 1:29). However, all living plants must pass through death before the life element within them can become nutrients to us. Later, God gave animals to man in order to sustain his life (9:3), but the life element within an animal cannot enter into us as nutrients to sustain our life unless there is death. This is a requirement. If a cow, sheep, chicken, or duck does not die, it cannot enter into us as nutrients. In order for a living creature to become food for sustenance, it must die; otherwise, it cannot become our inner substance. This unchangeable law was ordained by God.</p>
<p>The tree of life in the garden of Eden typifies the life of God (2:9). God&rsquo;s intention in putting Adam in front of the tree of life was for Adam to eat the fruit of the tree of life and receive the life contained in it. God put the man whom He had created in front of the tree of life so that man would receive His eternal life. According to the law mentioned above, if Adam had chosen to eat the fruit of the tree of life, it would have been necessary for the fruit of the tree of life to pass through death in order to become his substance. This means that God had to pass through death so that His life could enter into us to become our life. The revelation contained in the Bible strongly confirms this conclusion. Beginning with Genesis, the Bible reveals that the life of God must pass through death in order to enter into us to become our life. God had to pass through death so that His life could be released and imparted into us.</p>
<p>Life is released through death and transmitted through death. In order for the life of a living creature to enter into another creature, the first must pass through the process of death. This great law concerning life is a deep thought in the Bible. According to this law, in order for the highest life&mdash;the uncreated, eternal life of God&mdash;to enter into created man, God had to pass through the process of death. The Creator had to pass through death in order to release and transmit His life into His creatures. If God had not passed through death, He could not have released His life, and He could not have transmitted His life into us. Death released His life and also transmitted His life into us. Without death there is no release of life, and there is no transmission of life. The release and transmission of life always take place through death.</p><h2 class="head1">THE POSITIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS&mdash;<br />
RELEASING AND TRANSMITTING THE LIFE OF GOD</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to release His life to man, but according to the law related to life, this life must pass through death in order to be released and transmitted. Hence, in order for God&rsquo;s purpose to be fulfilled, there is a need for the cross. In order to carry out His eternal plan according to His purpose, God determined to have the cross. The positive function of the cross is to release His eternal life and to transmit it into man for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>Most Christians consider the function of the cross merely in relation to redeeming fallen people from their sins. Such Christians believe that if man had not sinned and fallen, there would be no need for the cross. To these Christians the cross of Christ exists only because man sinned and fell; that is, to them the cross is needed only for the redemption of sins. This is a natural human view. The Bible, however, reveals that the function of the cross is not only for the redemption of sins but also for the release and transmission of God&rsquo;s life. The redemption of sins is not the positive function of the cross; rather, it is the negative function of the cross. The positive function of the cross is to release and transmit the life of God.</p>
<p>Thus, even if man had not sinned, there would still have been a need for the cross, because God had to pass through death in order to release and transmit His life. In other words, regardless of whether man needs to be redeemed from his sins, God had to pass through the death of the cross because His eternal purpose is to release and transmit His life. His eternal intention is to release and transmit His life through His death on the cross. Nevertheless, God in His foreknowledge knew that man would sin, and so He planned that the cross also would be for the redemption of sins. However, God&rsquo;s primary purpose is to release and transmit His life through the cross; His secondary purpose is the redemption of sins through the cross. God&rsquo;s primary intention with regard to the cross is not to redeem man from sins but to release and transmit His life. The positive function of the cross is to release and transmit God&rsquo;s life, and the negative function of the cross is to redeem man from sins.</p>
<p>The primary function of the cross does not depreciate or lessen the value of the cross in the Lord&rsquo;s redemptive work. We value and treasure the Lord&rsquo;s redemptive work and acknowledge the value of the cross in regard to our redemption from our sins. However, we are stressing the fact that there are two aspects to the function of the cross. It is easy to value the cross&rsquo;s function in redeeming us from sins and to neglect its function of releasing and transmitting the life of God. Hence, we are burdened to point out that the redemption of sins speaks only of the negative function of the cross. The positive function of the cross is to release and transmit the life of God. Both the positive and the negative aspects of the function of the cross are precious.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S LIFE-RELEASING AND<br />
LIFE-TRANSMITTING DEATH</h2>
<p>In John 12:24 the Lord spoke of the positive function of the cross, the releasing and transmitting of life, saying, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; There is life inside a grain of wheat, but if the grain does not die, the life within it cannot be released to produce other grains. If the grain dies, the life within it will be released and transmitted into many grains. The grain of wheat that the Lord referred to was Himself. Within the shell of Jesus&rsquo; humanity was the eternal, unlimited life of God. The Lord Jesus came to the earth in order to impart the life within Him into man and for man to receive this life. The only way that the life within Him could be imparted into man was through death. It was possible for His life to be released and transmitted only through death. He could not bypass this law.</p>
<p>If the Lord Jesus had not died, the life of God would have remained in Him and would not have been released from within Him in order to enter into many people. If the Lord Jesus had not been incarnated as a man and had not then died as a man, only He, as God&rsquo;s only begotten Son, would have had the life of God, but He would not have been able to share the life of God with others so that they could become God&rsquo;s many sons (Eph. 5:25). The Lord Jesus had to die, just like a grain of wheat, so that the life within Him could be released and transmitted to those who are joined to Him through faith. On the positive side, His death released and transmitted the eternal, unlimited life of God from within Him. This is the positive function of the cross, and it is also God&rsquo;s intention for the cross.</p>
<p>Many saints neglect the life-releasing and life-transmitting death in John 12:24. They know that the Lord&rsquo;s death redeemed them from their sins, but they do not know that the Lord&rsquo;s death released and transmitted the life of God. These saints overemphasize the redemptive aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death, and they neglect the life-releasing aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death. The Lord&rsquo;s word in verse 24, however, clearly reveals the life-releasing aspect of His death. If we consider the Lord&rsquo;s death as it is portrayed in this verse, there is no mention of the relationship between the Lord&rsquo;s death and the redemption of sins. The Lord spoke of a grain of wheat dying only in relation to the release and transmission of life. Although the Lord&rsquo;s death is for the redemption of sins, we must be clear that the Lord&rsquo;s death is not only for the redemption of sins but also for the release of His life. The Lord&rsquo;s death has both a redemptive aspect and a life-releasing aspect. The Lord&rsquo;s death has a redemptive element and a life-releasing element. We should value the life-releasing element of the Lord&rsquo;s death just as much as we value the redemptive element of His death.</p>
<p>There is a type in the Old Testament that gives a thorough portrayal of the life-releasing and life-transmitting aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death. This type is the building of Eve. Eve was not created by God apart from Adam. Rather, she was built out of a rib that was taken from Adam&rsquo;s side when God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him (Gen. 2:21-22). Eve was produced out of Adam and was a part of Adam. Because she shared one life with Adam, she was one flesh with Adam (vv. 23-24). Ephesians 5 reveals that the type of Adam and Eve speaks of the mystery of Christ and the church (v. 32). God caused Adam to fall asleep and opened his side to produce Eve. In Adam&rsquo;s sleep, which typifies the death of Christ, there was no thought of sin or of redeeming Eve from sins. Adam&rsquo;s side was opened when he slept, and a rib was taken from his side. Similarly, when Christ died on the cross, His side was opened, and blood and water flowed out (John 19:34).</p>
<p>Adam&rsquo;s sleep and his side being opened were for the release of the life within him and for the transmitting of his life into Eve. Without this sleep, Adam&rsquo;s life could not have been released to produce Eve. This indicates that the death of Christ and the piercing of His side on the cross were for the releasing of His life and the transmitting of this life as water to the church. Without His death, Christ&rsquo;s life could not have been released to produce the church. In order to produce the church, Christ had to die. Therefore, the building of Eve and the imparting of Adam&rsquo;s life into Eve indicate that the Creator had to die to impart His life into us. Christ&rsquo;s body was broken so that the life within Him could be released. This aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death has nothing to do with the redemption of sins; it is altogether for the release and transmission of life. The positive aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death is for releasing the unlimited, divine life within Him and for imparting this life into us to make us the church. As the church, we share the life of Christ in order to become one with Him as His mysterious Body, just as Eve shared the life of Adam to became one flesh with him (Eph. 5:31-32).</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEATH OF CHRIST ON THE CROSS<br />
BEING HIS RELEASE</h2>
<p>The death of Christ on the cross released the life that was within Him; hence, this death was actually His release. The Lord Jesus came to the earth through incarnation&mdash;full of the unlimited life of God (John 1:14)&mdash;in order to impart His life into many people. His unlimited life was constrained within the outer shell of His humanity. Therefore, His outer shell needed to be broken through death so that the life concealed within Him could be released. In terms of the life concealed in Him, the Lord Jesus was constrained even before His outer shell was broken through death. In Luke 12:50 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!&rdquo; The baptism with which the Lord was to be baptized was His death on the cross. Before this death was accomplished, He was pressed in the shell of the humanity that He had put on in incarnation. He said, &ldquo;How I am pressed!&rdquo; A grain of wheat is a good example of this. If a grain of wheat does not pass through death, the life within it is constrained within its outer shell. If a grain of wheat could speak, it would probably shout, &ldquo;I have a death to pass through, and how I am constrained!&rdquo; If a grain of wheat had any feeling, it would long to pass through death so that the life within it could be released. As soon as a grain dies, the life and fullness within it are released. The life that is released is able to multiply and bring forth many grains. However, until the grain dies, it is constrained within its outer shell. This was the situation when Christ, the Lord of life, was on the earth. Before He went to the cross to die, His unlimited, immeasurable divine life that transcends time and space was constrained within the man Jesus the Nazarene. In this sense, the Lord Jesus longed to die; He desired that the death of the cross would come quickly and that His baptism would be accomplished sooner so that He could be released and glorified (cf. John 17:1). Without death the Lord Jesus could neither be released nor glorified. When He died, He was released and He was glorified.</p>
<p>The purpose of Christ coming to the earth and becoming flesh was to die on the cross. Incarnation alone was not the purpose of His coming to the earth; death was the ultimate purpose of His coming to the world. He became flesh for the sake of death. The Lord&rsquo;s word in Luke 12:50 indicates that He longed to die, because through death He would be released and would enter into glory. When the death of the cross was imminent, the Lord prayed, &ldquo;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You&rdquo; (John 17:1). When the Lord appeared to two of His disciples on their way to Emmaus after His death and resurrection, He pointed out that His death was for Him to enter into glory (Luke 24:26).</p>
<p>The life, glory, and beauty within a grain of wheat are released through death. Likewise, the life and glory within Christ were released through His death. The life in Christ is rich, bright, and glorious, but there was no way, apart from death, for the glorious life within Him to be released. When the Lord Jesus died, the life within Him was released, and He entered into glory.</p>
<p>The glorious life in Christ was released like a fire, and it kindled a fire in whomever it entered (12:49). This fire of life was kindled in Peter, John, and the other apostles. This fire of life continues to burn without ceasing even until today. The past two thousand years of church history prove that this released fire changed the little Galilean fishermen into bold and powerful men, and it has also changed cowardly and filthy sinners into strong and sanctified witnesses. This fire of life cannot be suppressed by any environment, force, opposition, or attack. This fire of life was released through the death of Christ on the cross. We must see and remember that the positive function and the central purpose of the cross are to release the life of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross was His release.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEGATIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 3:15; Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; 16:11; 1 Pet. 2:24; Rom. 8:3; Gal. 6:14; 5:24; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; Heb. 10:20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEGATIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS&mdash;<br />
THE ASPECT OF TERMINATION</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that God determined the positive function of the cross according to His eternal plan. Similarly, God determined the negative function of the cross according to His eternal plan. In order to accomplish the good pleasure of His will, God determined to release His life through the cross. At the same time, however, God knew that He would encounter the consequences of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall in the process of accomplishing His eternal will. In order to solve these problems, God determined to terminate through the cross everything that would be contrary to Him. In its positive function the cross releases everything that is of God, and in its negative function the cross terminates everything that is not of God, everything that is contrary to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating Satan</h2>
<p>In the universe the first thing contrary to God is Satan. As the Daystar (Isa. 14:12), Satan was one of the earliest angels created by God at the &ldquo;dawn&rdquo; of the universe, and he was the first among God&rsquo;s creation to rebel against God. He was the initiator of rebellion, the originator of sin in the universe (John 8:44). He then led a group of God-created angels to rebel against God (cf. Rev. 12:4, 9) and enticed the God-created man to forsake God (Gen. 3:1-7). He led astray a group of God-created angels in heaven, and he beguiled the God-created man on the earth. He infringed upon God&rsquo;s glory and authority, damaged God&rsquo;s arrangement and order, violated God&rsquo;s holiness and righteousness, and defiled God&rsquo;s creation and work. He wanted to frustrate God&rsquo;s will and usurp His throne (Isa. 14:13-14). God&rsquo;s uniquely honored name was blasphemed, and His divine dignity was insulted. Satan was the first problem that God encountered in accomplishing His will. Therefore, Satan was the first item that God had to deal with and terminate by the cross.</p>
<p>When Satan first appears in the Bible, he is in the form of a serpent, seeking to ensnare man in sin (Gen. 3:1-7). In His judgment on the serpent, God prophesied that the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; of the woman would &ldquo;bruise&rdquo; the serpent on the head (v. 15). Bruising a serpent&rsquo;s head deals a fatal blow to the serpent and puts it to death. The seed of the woman is a reference to Christ in His first coming, for only He among mankind was &ldquo;born of a woman&rdquo; (Gal. 4:4; Matt. 1:23). God&rsquo;s prophecy concerning Satan in Genesis 3:15 clearly indicates that Christ would come to put Satan to death.</p>
<p>Satan resented to the uttermost Christ&rsquo;s coming to the earth, and at God&rsquo;s appointed time Satan was allowed to inflict death upon Christ. Satan thought that he could cut Christ off from the earth. The wound inflicted upon Christ, however, merely bruised His heel and afflicted Him (v. 15). This bruising did not destroy Christ through death; rather, it gave Him an opportunity to destroy Satan, who had the might of death, through His death on the cross (Heb. 2:14). Before Christ died on the cross, He declared, &ldquo;Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out&rdquo; (John 12:31), and in Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, Satan, &ldquo;the ruler of this world,&rdquo; was judged (16:11). The cross of Christ terminated Satan.</p>
<p>The cross of Christ has a negative function of terminating Satan. The effect of cross of Christ was a deathblow to Satan; he was destroyed on the cross. Wherever the cross is applied, Satan and his work are destroyed. Thus, he has no ground, and he cannot move.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating the Authority of Darkness</h2>
<p>When Satan rebelled against God, some of the other angels followed him (cf. Rev. 12:4). Thus, Satan also has &ldquo;his angels&rdquo; (Matt. 25:41). These corrupted angels are now the &ldquo;world-rulers of this darkness,&rdquo; &ldquo;the rulers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the authorities&rdquo; in the heavenlies (Eph. 6:12), and Satan is &ldquo;the ruler of the authority of the air&rdquo; (2:2). When Christ destroyed Satan on the cross, He destroyed these satanic authorities of the air and their authority of darkness. Hence, Colossians 2:15 speaks of Christ &ldquo;stripping off the rulers and the authorities&rdquo; on the cross. The Greek word for <em>stripping off</em> means &ldquo;to spoil, shake off, or put off,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;to put away or terminate.&rdquo; The cross of Christ spoiled Satan&rsquo;s angelic followers and all the authority of darkness in the air by terminating them.</p>
<p>Just as the cross of Christ terminated Satan, it also terminated his angels. At the cross Christ overcame Satan&rsquo;s angels. Wherever the cross is applied, Satan&rsquo;s angels, demons, and evil spirits are put to shame and have no ground to operate.</p><h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating Sin</h2>
<p>Sin originated with Satan, who rebelled against God. When he enticed man to disobey God, Satan&rsquo;s sinful nature was injected into man, corrupting the man whom God had created to accomplish His eternal plan. When sin entered into man, it was mixed with man&rsquo;s human life and nature, and it became a power that causes man to commit sins. Out from this sinful nature, man commits sins and has a record of sins before God. Now the power of sin is in our being, and our record of sins is before God. We are in sin (Psa. 51:5), having a share in sin and in the sinful things related to sin. It is impossible for us to deal with either our sinful nature or our sins. Who can wash away his sinful deeds and remove his record of sins before God? Who can overcome the power of indwelling sin? No one can do this. However, the cross of Christ dealt with and terminated our nature of sin and removed our record of sins.</p>
<p>God put our sinful deeds, the various sins that we have committed, upon the crucified Christ so that He could bear them for us and redeem us. Christ&rsquo;s redemption satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, removing our record of sins before God. Furthermore, when Christ died on the cross, He was crucified as a man, in the &ldquo;likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 8:3); thus, the sin that dwells in man (7:17), together with its power, was judged and condemned in the flesh on the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>Just as the cross of Christ redeemed us from our sinful deeds, it condemned and dealt with our sinful nature and its power. Without the cross of Christ our record of sins could not have been put away, and the sin in our being could not have been dealt with. Without the cross of Christ, our record of sin could not be removed, and the power of sin could not be terminated. Thank God that the cross of Christ has dealt with sin and everything related to sin! The cross removes our record of sins, and it deals with the power of sin. Because of the cross, there is no condemnation due to sins and no authority of sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating the World</h2>
<p>After Satan enticed and beguiled man, he used the world to control and usurp man. On the one hand, Satan injected sin into man; on the other hand, he surrounded man with the world. Satan used sin to corrupt the man whom God had created for His plan, and then he used the world to usurp the man whom God had prepared for Himself. Sin originated with Satan, and he organized the world. Satan uses sin and the world to operate on man from within and without, bringing man under his control to prevent man from being gained by God (1 John 5:19). Both sin and the world create enmity with God (Rom. 5:10, Col. 1:21; James 4:4).</p>
<p>If no one can overcome the sin that has been injected into man, who can escape from the world that surrounds man? Many desire to escape from the world to be gained by God, just as they desire to overcome sin to please God. However, just as we cannot overcome sin no matter how much we endeavor, we cannot escape from the world no matter how much we struggle. We cannot subdue sin or escape from the world. Therefore, just as God dealt with sin through the cross of Christ, He dealt with the world through the cross of Christ. When Christ was lifted up on the cross, not only was the ruler of this world, Satan, cast out, but also the world was judged (John 12:31-32). Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross judged and destroyed the ruler of this world, and it judged and destroyed the world that he rules.</p>
<p>The cross of Christ not only dealt with the sin that indwells us but also the world that surrounds us. It frees us not only from corrupting sin but also from the usurping world (Gal. 1:4). The cross separates us from the world. Hence, like Paul, we can declare that through the cross the world has been crucified to us and we to the world (6:14). Whoever receives the cross is freed from the usurpation of the world. The world has no authority over those who receive the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating the Flesh<br />
with Its Passions and Its Lusts</h2>
<p>Because Satan injected sin into the human body, our body was transmuted into the flesh (Gen. 6:3), which is full of passions and lusts (Gal. 5:24; cf. Col. 3:5). The flesh with its passions and its lusts collaborates with indwelling sin to deprive us of our freedom and to make us do what we do not will to do (Rom. 7:14-15). It causes us to indulge in sinful things and makes us children of wrath before God (Eph. 2:3). Even if we struggled with all our might, we could not rid ourselves of our transmuted flesh, the body of this death (Rom. 7:24).</p>
<p>Just as our flesh collaborates with sin inwardly, it connects us with the world outwardly. As those who walk according to the age of this world, we also conduct ourselves in the lusts of our flesh (Eph. 2:2-3). Sin stirs up the flesh from within, and the world entices the flesh from without. The flesh is stirred up by sin and touched by the world. The flesh, sin, and the world become one and act as one to cause man to oppose God. Verses 7 and 8 of Romans 8 say, &ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be. And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flesh is not just connected with Satan; it is the place from which and the instrument by which Satan works. Satan is operating within us, causing us to walk &ldquo;according to the age of this world&rdquo; and to conduct ourselves &ldquo;in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts&rdquo; (Eph. 2:2-3). James speaks of the lusts of the flesh, the world, and Satan as being three great enemies to our living of a godly life (4:1, 4, 7). Satan entices our flesh through the world and stirs up our flesh to love the world, causing us to walk according to the age of this world, to befriend this world, and to be at enmity with God. Thus, the flesh, the world, and Satan act as one to cause man to be at enmity with God.</p>
<p>Because of the corruption of sin and the stirring up by Satan, the flesh is so strong that our whole being obeys it, lives by it, and becomes &ldquo;fleshly&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:3). Thus, we become flesh and are called &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; (Rom. 3:20). The flesh is weak in the things of God (8:3), and there is no profit from the flesh in our spiritual life (John 6:63). The nature of the flesh cannot change; the flesh is flesh (3:6); it cannot become anything else. God does not improve man&rsquo;s flesh, nor does He have a desire to improve it. God wants to terminate the flesh by the cross of Christ. It is His will that our flesh with its passions and its lusts would be crucified on the cross of Christ. According to God&rsquo;s determination and His way of salvation, the flesh does not need to be improved; it only needs to be crucified, and it has been crucified (Gal. 5:24). The cross of Christ has terminated the flesh and everything of the flesh. When the cross of Christ is received, the flesh and everything of the flesh are put to death.</p><h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating the Old Man</h2>
<p>God originally created man according to His image (Gen. 1:26-27); thus, man&rsquo;s life and nature were pure and good. However, his life and nature became defiled, evil, and old because of the corruption of sin (Eph. 4:22). Hence, when the Bible speaks of the old man, it is referring to our sin-corrupted life and nature. After the fall, our life and nature belong to sin, incline to sin, and cooperate easily with our &ldquo;body of sin&rdquo; (Rom. 6:6), in which sin dwells. Thus, they are old in God&rsquo;s eyes. Our life and nature&mdash;the old man&mdash;are directed by sin and use our body of sin to commit sins. Therefore, sin lords it over us by directing our old man&mdash;our old life and nature&mdash;to use our body of sin to enslave us to sin. Our old man must be dealt with in order for us to be freed from the bondage of sin.</p>
<p>Romans 6:6 says, &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s way of salvation is to crucify our old man on the cross of Christ. Once the old man is crucified, the body of sin is annulled so that we no longer need to serve sin as slaves but instead can be freed from the bondage of sin. Thus, the cross of Christ has terminated the old man&mdash;the old corrupted life and nature within us&mdash;which causes us to sin. When the cross of Christ is received, the old man, with his old life and nature, is put to death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating the &ldquo;I&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; The &ldquo;I&rdquo; in this verse refers to our whole being. Everything of our person is included in this &ldquo;I,&rdquo; whether good or bad. This &ldquo;I&rdquo; was terminated by the cross of Christ. Not only were Satan and his angels, sin and the world, and our flesh and the old man terminated by the cross, even our person, our &ldquo;I,&rdquo; was terminated by the cross.</p>
<p>Most of us think that our flesh is evil and should be crucified and that our old man is corrupt and should be terminated by the cross, but we do not necessarily think that our person, our &ldquo;I,&rdquo; is bad or displeasing to God. Consequently, we focus on improving ourselves rather than on being terminated. This was the view of the Galatians, and this is the view of many of us who do not know God&rsquo;s salvation or ourselves. We think that we can please God, and we even believe that God wants us to please Him in ourselves. Little do we know that our whole being has been defiled and corrupted by sin, that nothing in our being pleases God, and that nothing from our being is acceptable to God. God does not expect us to do anything for Him; neither does He require anything of us. God has no desire that we would improve ourselves through our own efforts. His forethought was focused on our complete termination through the cross of Christ. In the eyes of God we have been crucified with Christ; our being was terminated on the cross (6:14; Rom. 6:6).</p>
<p>Many in Christianity today consider the cross to be a matter of suffering and believe that its purpose is to make people suffer; hence, they regard the significance of the cross merely to be suffering. This view comes from man&rsquo;s traditional or natural concept. Many who are saved hold this view before they even read the Bible or hear a spiritual truth. As soon as the cross is mentioned, many brothers and sisters think that it involves a heavy burden of suffering. However, this view is wrong, and it hinders us from properly understanding the significance of the cross. Many are veiled by this view and do not have light concerning the cross of Christ. We must remove this concept of suffering completely in order to properly understand the significance of the cross.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the main significance of the cross is not suffering but death. The ancient Roman Empire used the cross not merely as a cruel punishment but as a capital punishment, not merely to inflict suffering but to put to death. The punishment of the cross did have an element of suffering, but its ultimate purpose was to put a person to death. In the Bible the cross is spoken of in relation to putting people into death, not in relation to merely suffering. A person who is crucified dies. The cross is a mark of death, not merely a sign of suffering. Whenever the cross is mentioned, we should think of death rather than suffering. The effect of the cross on man is death. When the Jews rejected the Lord Jesus, they cried out, &ldquo;Take Him away! Take Him away! Crucify Him!&rdquo; (John 19:15). To be taken away is to be terminated. Whoever is crucified is terminated. Hence, the significance of the cross is related to being put to death.</p>
<p>The teachings of many religions in the world, especially Hinduism and Buddhism, are centered on suffering, and their practice is nothing more than the acceptance and endurance of suffering, including penance and austerity. Even Catholicism brought in this mixture of pagan things. The proper and pure Christian faith does not involve the acceptance and endurance of suffering, but it does involve the experience of Christ&rsquo;s death. Suffering is not the way of salvation given by God; instead, it is a method of cultivation originating from man. God&rsquo;s way of salvation involves only death; it does not involve man&rsquo;s suffering. God&rsquo;s way of salvation involves man&rsquo;s termination through the death of Christ on the cross. According to the revelation in the Bible, Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross is God&rsquo;s great salvation to man; death, like life, is an important item revealed in the Bible.</p>
<p>Many Christians regard sickness, hardship, unemployment, or poverty as a &ldquo;cross&rdquo; to bear. Many also regard a wife, husband, children, parents, servants, employees, or anything unsatisfactory as a &ldquo;cross&rdquo; to bear. If we have a realization that difficult persons, matters, and things are used by the Holy Spirit to bring us into the experience of the death of the cross so that an element in us would be put to death, it is not wrong to associate these things with the cross. However, if we associate these difficult things with the cross only because of the sufferings and heavy burdens inflicted by them, then this is not a correct understanding of the cross. God allows us to encounter unsatisfactory matters and difficult persons so that we would experience the termination of the cross in a certain aspect of our being, not for the sake of afflicting us in a certain matter or trying us on a certain point. God has terminated us through the death of Christ on the cross, but now the Spirit must bring us into the experience of the termination of His death through the people and things that we encounter.</p>
<p>God has ordained for us to die, and in God&rsquo;s valuation of us, we are worthy only of death. What He did on the cross in reality, He wants to do in us practically. The cross terminated our whole being, but through our experience of the cross, God looks forward to our saying, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). We have been terminated; hence, we should no longer live.</p><h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating All Things</h2>
<p>Due to Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and Adam&rsquo;s disobedience, all creation has been defiled and corrupted. As the representative of all creation, Satan was appointed to rule over the preadamic world. When he rebelled, everything that he ruled over and represented was defiled and corrupted. Not only was the earth and everything in it affected by his rebellion, even the heavens and everything in them were defiled and corrupted. Thus, all things needed to be terminated. As the representative of all creation after God&rsquo;s restoration of the universe, Adam was appointed to rule over all things on the earth (Gen. 1:26). When he disobeyed, everything that he ruled over and represented was defiled and corrupted (Rom. 5:12-19). Thus, the heavens and the earth and everything in them needed God&rsquo;s termination. Based on His foreknowledge, God determined to meet this need with the cross of Christ in His eternal plan. Hence, the cross of Christ terminated all things in the heavens and on the earth in the old creation in addition to the other negative things.</p>
<p>According to the revelation in the Bible, everything in the old heavens and old earth&mdash;the old creation&mdash;was terminated on the cross of Christ. When Christ died on the cross, He died there not only in and with humanity but also with all creation. Hence, Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross involved not only man&rsquo;s death but also the termination of all creation.</p>
<p>According to Matthew 27:51, when Christ died on the cross, &ldquo;the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom.&rdquo; Hebrews 10:20 says that this veil is Christ&rsquo;s flesh. Therefore, the splitting of the veil symbolizes the death of Christ&rsquo;s physical body. This veil was embroidered with cherubim (Exo. 26:31), and when it was split, the cherubim on the veil were split as well. According to Ezekiel, cherubim typify creatures (10:1-22; 1:5-14). The four living creatures in Revelation 4:6 and 7 are like cherubim in appearance (Ezek. 10:14-15; 1:5-10). With respect to having six wings (Rev. 4:8), they are also like the seraphim in Isaiah 6:2. We may say that the four living creatures, representing creation before God (Rev. 4:6-7), are cherubim plus seraphim. Hence, the veil with the cherubim typifies Christ with all creation. The splitting of the cherubim on the veil along with the veil itself typifies that all creation died together with Christ. The picture of the splitting of the veil with the cherubim indicates that when Christ died, all creation died with Him. Hence, Christ&rsquo;s death terminated everything of creation.</p>
<p>The death of Christ is an all-inclusive death. In order to accomplish this all-inclusive death, Christ had to be joined with all things through incarnation. His being joined with all things enabled Him, positively, to give God&rsquo;s uncreated life to the created man and, negatively, to terminate all creation. He became flesh to be joined with all things in order to give God&rsquo;s uncreated life to the created man and to terminate all creation through His death.</p>
<p>Man is the head and representative of all creation on earth, and by being joined to man, Christ was joined with all creation, as represented by man. Strictly speaking, Christ was joined to man; generally speaking, He was joined to all creation. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation was God&rsquo;s entering into creation to be joined with creation. When Christ put on humanity, He put on all creation. Just as the veil in the temple had cherubim on it, Christ had creation on Him. Just as Adam represented the entire human race and bore all of creation, as indicated by Genesis 1 and Romans 5, Christ was joined to man and bore everything of creation. All things were joined to and borne by the incarnated Christ. In a sense, Bethlehem, the place of incarnation, is representative of the universe, and Jesus the Nazarene is representative of all things. He entered into the universe and put on all things; all things are in Him. Therefore, His death was the death of all things. Everything borne by Him was included in His death. He took all things to the cross to die with Him. Therefore, the death of Christ was an all-inclusive death.</p>
<p>Although the death of Christ is extensive, people have limited views of His death. To a person who does not know God&rsquo;s salvation, Jesus was merely a Jew who died on a cross. To a new believer, Jesus died on the cross as a Substitute for our sins in order to be our Savior. To a believer who has some growth in the divine life, Jesus also destroyed Satan and terminated his angels, the world, the flesh, the old man, and the self on the cross. However, to a believer with even more growth, Jesus terminated all things on the cross. Jesus died on the cross as both God and man, as both Creator and creature, and as both man and all creation. He dealt with sins, the flesh, the old man, Satan, the world under Satan, and all the corrupted angels, demons, and evil spirits. All these things died on the cross. Everything that was not God died on the cross. Thus, Christ&rsquo;s terminating death on the cross was an all-inclusive death.</p>
<p>May we truly see Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death on the cross. All things were terminated on the cross of Christ. Everything contrary to God, incompatible with God, in opposition to God, offensive to God, and not of God, whether Satan, demons, sin, the world, the flesh, the old man, the self, or all creation, was terminated on the cross. Everything of Satan and the world, everything of sin and the flesh, and everything that belonged to them and to all creation, whether good or bad, were terminated on the cross. The cross of Christ is a great termination, a great clearing up. Everything that God does not want was terminated there.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEGATIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 2:9; Col. 1:20; 2:15</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEGATIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS&mdash;<br />
THE ASPECT OF REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>The cross of Christ not only terminates; it also redeems. The cross terminates Satan, sin, the world, and everything that is contrary to God, incompatible with God, condemned by God, and rejected by God. The cross also redeems everything that God foreordained that He would gain, everything that belongs to God, and everything that is for God. In order to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal plan, the cross of Christ terminates everything that is not of God, that opposes God, and that resists God, and the cross also redeems everything that was lost but that God wants to gain, that is for God, and that belongs to God. This is the negative function of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Redeeming All Things</h2>
<p>Many people believe that the redemption Christ accomplished on the cross is only for the redemption of sinful and fallen man. However, the Bible speaks of Christ dying on the cross not only for sinners but also for all things. Hebrews 2:9 says that Jesus tasted death on behalf of everything. The blood that Christ shed on the cross reconciles sinful and God-opposing man to God, and it also reconciles to God all things that were affected by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, &ldquo;whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens&rdquo; (Col. 1:20). Thus, Christ redeemed man and all things on the cross. Christ&rsquo;s redemption of all things is related to three matters.</p>
<p>First, all things were created by God according to His eternal plan to express Christ; hence, all things are related to Christ (John 1:3; Col. 1:16). God created all things to fulfill His purpose, but they were defiled by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall before this purpose could be realized. Nevertheless, God did not abandon His desire for His creation to express Christ. God&rsquo;s plan included the redemption of all things in order to accomplish His eternal purpose for Christ related to all things.</p>
<p>Second, God first appointed Satan and then man to be the head and representative of all creation, and He gave them the authority to rule over all things in creation (Ezek. 28:13-14; Luke 4:5-6; Gen. 1:26). Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s subsequent fall defiled all that they represented and ruled. With Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, creation was no longer in a condition that matched God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. In order for the righteous, holy, and glorious God to use creation in His glorious plan for His Son, Christ had to taste death on the cross on behalf of everything, according to the requirements of His righteousness, holiness, and glory.</p>
<p>Third, God created all things to be a delight to Christ. The Bible unveils that Christ found delight in and loved created man and that He also found delight in and loved all things that God had created for Him (Rom 8:28; 11:36; Eph. 1:23; Col. 1:20). Christ died on the cross for all things, and He redeemed them according to God&rsquo;s predetermined will, according to the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Joined to All Things<br />
in Order to Redeem All Things</h2>
<p>In order for Christ to redeem all things, He had to be joined to all things. In order to redeem all things that had been lost and to taste death on behalf of everything, Christ entered into creation and was joined to it. In His incarnation the Word became flesh in order to be joined to man and to all things (John 1:14). Although the incarnation was necessary in order to impart the uncreated life of God into created man through Christ&rsquo;s putting on of humanity and all things, incarnation was also necessary in order to redeem man by His suffering God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on behalf of man and all things.</p>
<p>Christ became flesh to be joined with creation, including man and all things; He put on creation. Hence, creation was hanging on Christ when He was on the cross, because it was included in Christ. When Christ died on the cross, He not only terminated all things but also suffered God&rsquo;s judgment and tasted death on behalf of all things in order to redeem man. Christ&rsquo;s death was an all-inclusive death that terminated all things and redeemed all things. His death terminated all things condemned by God and redeemed all things that God wanted to gain.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being joined to all things and His bringing all things with Him through the judgment of His death are typified by the ark that passed through the judgment of the flood in Genesis. The ark contained Noah&rsquo;s family of eight and all the animals (chs. 7&mdash;8). The ark typifies Christ, and Noah&rsquo;s family typifies redeemed man. Noah&rsquo;s family being in the ark means that redeemed man is in Christ. The animals that were in the ark typify all things being redeemed in Christ. The animals in the ark passed through the judgment of the flood. Similarly, all creation passed through the judgment of death in Christ. The animals were included in the ark and passed through the flood so that they might be redeemed. Similarly, creation was joined to Christ and passed through death in Christ in order to be redeemed. Just as the ark redeemed the animals from God&rsquo;s condemnation and judgment so that they would be acceptable to God, Christ redeemed all things from God&rsquo;s condemnation and judgment into His presence so that creation would be acceptable to God.</p><h2 class="head2">All Redeemed Things Being before God</h2>
<p>In Revelation all the redeemed things are before God. In chapters 4 and 5 the four living creatures who are before God represent not only creation but also redeemed creation. In 4:9-11 the four living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits upon the throne, to the God who has created all things, and in 5:9 the four living creatures sing praise to the redeeming Lamb, who was slain and has purchased for God by His blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation. In verse 13 every creature that is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them says, &ldquo;To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might.&rdquo; The four living creatures are before God and praise Him as representatives, and all things, which were not merely created but also redeemed, are before God. On the cross Christ accomplished redemption for all creation. God redeemed all creation through the death of Christ on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Redeemed Creation Hoping to Be Restored</h2>
<p>Because all things have been redeemed by the cross of Christ, they hope to be freed from the slavery of corruption, the result of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, into the freedom of the glory of the redeemed children of God (Rom. 8:21); that is, all creation hopes to be restored (Acts 3:21). During the coming restoration, all things will be freed from the effect and defilement of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall. The condition of all things will match Isaiah&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, / And the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days&rdquo;; &ldquo;the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, / And the fruitful field is considered to be a forest&rdquo;; and &ldquo;the wolf and the lamb will feed as one, / And the lion will eat straw like the ox... / They will not harm nor destroy&rdquo; (Isa. 30:26; 32:15; 65:25). All things will be restored because they have been redeemed by Christ. All things will be freed from the slavery of corruption, which was brought in by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, through the redemption that Christ accomplished on the cross by shedding His blood. His redemption reconciles all things to God and brings them into the freedom of the glory of the redeemed children of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Redeemed Man Being Higher<br />
and More Important Than All Things</h2>
<p>Even though the redemption that Christ accomplished on the cross was for all things as well as man, the primary focus of redemption is on man. Man is the most important thing that God created through Christ and for Christ; hence, man is also the most important thing that God redeemed through Christ and for Christ. God determined in His plan that man would be the most important creature and also the center of all created things. Everything that has been redeemed is a means to express the glory of Christ, but redeemed man is more than just a means to express the glory of Christ. Redeemed man is also a vessel to contain Christ&rsquo;s life with Christ&rsquo;s nature (Rom. 9:21-24). All things were reconciled to God through the cross of Christ, but only man also received the life of God through the cross of Christ. Christ redeemed all things on the cross so that all things could express the riches of His glory, but He redeemed man so that man would also be filled with the fullness of His life (Eph. 3:19). All things were redeemed by Christ, but all things did not receive His life and nature; hence, they cannot be the same as Christ. However, through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, man also received Christ&rsquo;s life and nature in order to be the same as Christ and to be His partner in glory (2 Pet. 1:3-4; Heb. 3:14). In relation to creation the death of Christ redeemed all things, but in relation to man the death of Christ gave man the divine life also. Man is the highest and most important creature redeemed by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Purpose of Redemption Being to Impart Life</h2>
<p>Christ terminated all things on the cross in order to clear up the defilement in the universe, and Christ redeemed all things on the cross in order to impart His life into man. Among the things that were redeemed, only man received the life of God. Christ accomplished redemption in order to impart His divine, uncreated life into created man. This is the central purpose of redemption. The redemption that Christ accomplished on the cross is to recover man and all things that were lost in the fall so that man could be gained as a vessel and God could impart His life into man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ&rsquo;s Redemptive Death Opening the Way<br />
for Redeemed Man to Receive the Divine Life</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death on the cross recovered and redeemed all things, including man, and also imparted the divine life to redeemed man. Christ imparted His divine, uncreated life into the man whom He redeemed through His death. In His redemptive death the divine life in Christ was released and imparted into man. The death of Christ was an all-inclusive death through which the Creator passed so that His uncreated, divine life could be released. In His death created man also died in order to receive the Creator&rsquo;s uncreated life. Before Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross the Creator could not be joined with created man. However, Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death joined the Creator with created man so that the life of the Creator could enter into created man.</p>
<p>This joining in death can be likened to grafting. A tree that produces sweet oranges has little in common with a tree that produces bitter oranges, but through a grafting cut that involves death, the two trees can be joined. Through a grafting cut, the life of a sweet orange tree can flow into a branch from a bitter orange tree. In order for the sweet orange tree to release its life, there is a need for a cut of death, but in order for a branch from the bitter orange tree to receive the life of the sweet orange tree, there is also a need for cutting. Both trees need a grafting cut of death before the life of one can become the life of the other. Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death, which joined and connected God the Creator to man the creature, is likened to grafting in Romans 11:17-24. In and through Christ&rsquo;s wonderful death, the uncreated life in God can enter into created man to be his life.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the release of the divine, uncreated life in Christ required both creation and redemption in order for this life to enter into created man. In creation God &ldquo;calls the things not being as being&rdquo; (4:17), but creation alone is not enough for Him to be able to impart His life to created man. God created all things out of nothing, but He did not impart His life into all the things He created. All things were created by God, but not all things have the life of the Creator. The life of the Creator entered into created man only through redemption. God&rsquo;s redemption &ldquo;gives life to the dead&rdquo; (v. 17). Furthermore, created man had to pass through death and resurrection in Christ in order to receive the divine life. Death and resurrection are implied in the redemptive death of Christ and in His divine life. The redemptive death of Christ brought created man into death so that the uncreated, divine life of Christ could enter into created man. Christ&rsquo;s redemption makes it possible for created man to receive the life of the Creator and be raised from the dead through faith to become a new creation.</p>
<p>The life of God the Creator can enter into created man because of Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death on the cross. Christ&rsquo;s death removes the barrier between man and God and enables man to draw near to God. His death also brings redeemed man into union with God so that God and man can be joined as one in the fellowship of God&rsquo;s uncreated, divine life. In Christ&rsquo;s death both God and man experienced death so that God&rsquo;s uncreated life could flow out of the creating and redeeming God into created and redeemed man. Without the death of Christ, the life in God would not have been released, and without the death of created man, God&rsquo;s life could not have entered into man even when it had been released. Both Christ and man had to die in order for the divine life to flow out of God into man. Both Christ and man had to be wounded before the life of God could enter into man.</p>
<p>Blood transfusion is an illustration of this. In order for blood to flow out of person A to be transfused into person B, both A and B must be cut. Both A and B must be cut in order for A&rsquo;s blood to become B&rsquo;s blood. Both God and man were cut in Christ&rsquo;s redemptive death on the cross so that God&rsquo;s life could flow into man. When the Lord died on the cross, He accomplished redemption, and His all-inclusive death &ldquo;wounded&rdquo; both God the Creator and man the creature. Thus, the uncreated life in the Creator could flow into created man and become his life. The Creator and the creature were joined not only in His death but also in the life that flowed out through His death.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ&rsquo;s Redemption Restoring<br />
All Redeemed Things and Making Them New</h2>
<p>Everything that was redeemed through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross will participate in the coming restoration. Redeemed creation will not share God&rsquo;s life, but it will be delivered out of the corruption of the old creation into glory. This is according to the principle of death and resurrection. The ultimate restoration of all things will come with the appearing of the new heaven and the new earth. The new heaven and new earth will come from the restored old heaven and old earth. This is also according to the principle of death and resurrection. On the side of termination and judgment, the old heaven and old earth will pass away (2 Pet. 3:10-12), but on the side of redemption and restoration, the old heaven and old earth will be restored to become the new heaven and new earth (v. 13; Rev. 21:1).</p>
<p>On the side of termination and judgment, we have been terminated on the cross, but on the side of redemption and the impartation of life, we have become the new creation by passing through death and resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3; 2 Cor. 5:17). Even though we are of the old creation, we have been renewed through regeneration, based on the redemption of Christ, to become the new creation. Similarly, all things of the old creation will be renewed and restored through the redemption of the cross to become the new heaven and the new earth. Whereas God&rsquo;s redeemed people will enter into His glory and into the freedom of His glory through the renewing of regeneration, the redeemed things will enter into this glory and freedom through the renewing of restoration (Rom. 8:21).</p>
<p>Even though all things and man were redeemed by the cross, the ultimate issue of the redemption of all things is different from the issue of the redemption of man. Whereas the ultimate issue of the redemption of man gives man God&rsquo;s life and renews man by regeneration, the ultimate issue of the application of redemption to all things will only be restoration by renewal. Although Christ&rsquo;s redemption on the cross restores all things, it does not regenerate all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VICTORY OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p>Negatively, the cross of Christ terminated and redeemed all things. The cross also overcame all things. The cross overcame Satan, who is the ruler of God&rsquo;s enemies, and the demons and evil spirits under him (Gen. 3:15; Heb. 2:14; Col. 2:15). The cross overcame sin (Rom. 8:3), the world (John 12:31), the flesh with its passions and lusts (Gal. 5:24), the old man (Rom. 6:6), and the self (Gal. 2:20). The cross overcame everything that opposes God, contradicts God, hinders God&rsquo;s will, and frustrates God&rsquo;s plan. The cross of Christ is a place of victory. It is the only place of victory in the universe. On the cross Christ triumphed over Satan and over his authority of darkness (Col. 2:15). Hence, Christ can plunder Satan&rsquo;s house and take back those taken captive by Satan (Matt. 12:29). On the cross Christ judged the world, releasing those who were usurped by the world. On the cross Christ dealt with sin, delivering those who were under the bondage of sin. On the cross Christ put the flesh and the old man to death, delivering man from the flesh and the old man. On the cross Christ removed all barriers between man and God, bringing estranged man fully into God&rsquo;s presence, even into God Himself. On the cross Christ overcame everything and accomplished everything.</p>
<p>May we see and receive the victory of the cross, and may we apply it to everything that we encounter. Whoever has the cross has victory. Wherever the cross is, there is victory. The cross is not only a place of victory; it is a place of triumph. The cross is not only victory; it is also a triumph (Col. 2:15). When we receive the cross, we have victory and triumph. May we overcome by the cross and triumph in the cross!</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD CONCERNING<br />
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p>There are two negative functions and one positive function of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Terminating Everything</h2>
<p>The first function of the cross of Christ is to terminate everything. The cross has terminated Satan, sin, sinners, the flesh with its passions and lusts, the old man, and the self. The cross has terminated man. This means that the cross has also terminated Satan, who was mixed with man. By terminating Satan, the cross also terminated the demons and evil spirits who were with him and the world that was under him. By terminating sin, the cross terminated the law as the power of sin (1 Cor. 15:54, 56; Col. 2:14). In terminating the flesh and the self, the cross terminated the law, which the flesh endeavors to obey and the self delights to keep. Everything that opposes God, is contrary to Him, frustrates His eternal plan, and hinders His work of the new creation has been terminated by the cross. Every difficulty and problem in the universe have been dealt with and terminated by the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Redeeming All Things</h2>
<p>The second function of the cross of Christ is to redeem all things. According to His plan, the cross redeemed everything that God created in order to be gained for Christ. God foreordained that man would be for Christ, and He created all things for Christ. The cross redeemed man and all things. It redeemed the earth and all things on the earth, and it redeemed the heavens and everything in the heavens that belongs to God. The cross redeemed everything that God desired to gain but was lost and everything that God prepared for Christ but was corrupted. Everything belonging to God and intended for God in heaven and on earth, whether people or things, was redeemed through the cross.</p>
<p>Redemption follows termination and accompanies termination. The cross of Christ terminated everything in the universe, and it also redeemed all things. The cross separated everything that God does not want from everything that He wants. Christ brought everything in the universe with Him into His all-inclusive death. Whatever God does not want was terminated by His death, and whatever God wants was redeemed by it. On the one hand, the death of the cross terminated everything that was hanging on Christ, and on the other hand, the cross redeemed the things that God desired to gain. The things of God that were terminated by His death were also redeemed through the death of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Imparting Life</h2>
<p>The third function of the cross of Christ is to impart life, to give God&rsquo;s uncreated life to created man. This is the primary function of the cross. The impartation of life is the primary focus of God&rsquo;s eternal plan related to the cross. Termination and redemption are related to the effect of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall on all things. If it were not for the corruption and defilement brought in by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, the only function of the cross of Christ would be to impart life. However, due to the consequences of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, God&rsquo;s eternal plan for the cross of Christ also includes the work of termination and redemption.</p>
<p>Termination and redemption are for imparting life; they are preparatory procedures for imparting life. Termination removes everything in the universe that hinders God from imparting His life into created man, and redemption regains man and all things in the universe for God so that man can be a vessel for the expression of God&rsquo;s life. The cross of Christ terminated everything in the universe that hindered God&rsquo;s life from entering into created man, everything that kept the divine life from being expressed. As vessels to express the life of God, man was redeemed by the cross of Christ so that God&rsquo;s life can be imparted into those who believe. The cross of Christ also restores all things to be a realm for the expression of God&rsquo;s glory. The cross of Christ accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal plan so that God&rsquo;s life can enter into man, and Christ can be expressed through all things.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CROSS BRINGING CHRIST TO US</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:20; 2 Cor. 4:10-11</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters we covered the place and function of the cross, both of which are objective to us. With this chapter we will begin to consider the experience of the cross, which is a subjective matter. Concerning the cross of Christ, we must have objective knowledge and subjective experience. In spiritual matters, genuine knowledge produces necessary experiences.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CROSS BEING NECESSARY</h2>
<p>A Christian must have adequate knowledge and experiences of Christ, and he must also have adequate knowledge and experiences of the cross. Christ and His cross are the center of God&rsquo;s eternal plan; therefore, they should be the center of our spiritual life and experience. Whether we are a proper Christian does not depend on how much we know the Bible or on the measure of our devoutness. Being a proper Christian depends on how much we know and experience Christ and His cross. Our knowledge of the Bible, our devoutness, and other spiritual things do not represent our spiritual weight and worth before God; only our knowledge and experience of Christ and His cross can determine our spiritual weight and worth. Only experiences that are in Christ and that have passed through His cross can be considered as being spiritual and having eternal worth. These experiences come from and are produced by our knowledge of Christ. Only the knowledge of Christ and His cross can lead us into genuine spiritual experiences, and only our experience of Christ and His cross can be considered as genuine spiritual experiences. Christ and His cross are the yardsticks that God uses to measure us and all that we have. Anything that falls short of Christ and cannot stand the test of the cross does not measure up to God&rsquo;s standard and will be rejected by Him.</p>
<p>Apart from Christ, our virtues and merits are not acceptable to God. Likewise, unless our godliness and spiritual exercise pass through the cross of Christ, they have no value before God. God is not pleased with any virtue or merit that is outside of Christ, and He has no desire for any form of godliness or spiritual exercise that is apart from the cross. God wants us to be terminated by the cross and to live in Christ. God does not care for our cultivation of godliness or for our spiritual exercise; He cares for our experience of the cross. He does not care for our self-cultivation or spirituality; He wants us to experience the termination of the cross. He does not want us to live out our human virtues and merits through self-cultivation and spiritual exercise; He wants us to live out Christ and His attributes through our experience of being terminated by the cross. How much have we experienced the cross in Christ, and how much have we experienced Christ through the cross? We must ask ourselves these questions. We must have sufficient knowledge and experience of Christ and His cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BRINGING CHRIST TO US</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word reveals that a Christian should let Christ be all in him. Christ enters into us through the cross, and He gains ground in us and becomes our all through the cross. The cross released His life from within Him so that it could be imparted into His redeemed ones. He went to the cross and entered into death in order to impart Himself and His life into those whom God had chosen and predestinated. As believers, we met and contacted Christ at the place of His death&mdash;the cross at Golgotha (John 19:17). Furthermore, we received Christ and His life through His death on the cross. At the cross we meet Christ, know Him, experience Him, and gain more of Him. At the cross we know Christ more, have deeper fellowship with Him, and experience and gain Him further. Through the cross He becomes our all so that we may grow into a full-grown man in His life and have the measure of the stature of His fullness (Eph. 4:13). Every aspect of our relationship with Christ and every experience of Christ are through the cross and depend on the cross.</p>
<p>The cross brings Christ to us so that we may experience and gain Him. No one can receive the life of Christ apart from the cross, no one can experience growth in life without experiencing more of the cross, and no one can mature in life without fully receiving the cross. Christ and the cross cannot be separated, just as His life cannot be separated from His death on the cross. The measure of Christ in us depends on how much we experience the death of the cross. If we do not have the cross, we do not have Christ. If we do not experience the death of the cross, we cannot experience the life of Christ. If we bear about in our body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, the life of Christ will be manifested in our body (2 Cor. 4:10). If we stand in the death of the cross, the life of Christ will be manifested in our body. The more we stand in and receive the death of the cross, the more the life of Christ will be manifested in our mortal flesh (v. 11).</p>
<p>The life of Christ always follows the death of the cross. There is no need for us to ask God to give us more of His life, because His life will be added to us as long as we accept the death of the cross. Whether or not His life is added to us depends on our willingness to accept the cross, and the degree of our willingness to accept the cross determines the measure of the divine life that is added to us. The more we are willing to accept the cross, the more we will receive the divine life. The cross paves the way for the life of Christ to be added to us and increases our measure of the life of Christ.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul spoke to the Corinthian believers concerning the cross because they lived and walked according to flesh, not according to Christ (1 Cor. 2:2). Only the cross can pave the way for Christ and increase our measure of Christ. When we accept the death of the cross, the life of Christ will have a way through us. Every time we experience the death of the cross, the life of Christ will gain more ground in us. It is not sufficient to pray and ask the Lord to occupy and fill us. Such prayers are often of no effect, because the Lord can occupy and fill us only through the cross. Only the cross can find the place, the ground, in us for Christ. How much the cross works in us determines how much Christ occupies us. How much we receive and experience the cross determines how much of Christ enters into us and fills us. If we fully accept the cross and allow it to work in us, Christ will occupy us and fill us wholly. When we are crucified with Christ, He will live in us (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS FULFILLING GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE IN US</h2>
<p>The cross fulfills God&rsquo;s eternal purpose in us by bringing Christ to us so that we may gain Him and so that He may become our all. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is for Christ to enter into us to be our all, and this purpose is carried out through the cross. The cross is the procedure through which God carries out His purpose. Christ is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and the cross is the procedure through which God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is carried out. God&rsquo;s purpose concerning Christ is fulfilled through the cross. Because God&rsquo;s purpose is for Christ to enter into us, Christ must be released. Moreover, because God&rsquo;s purpose is for Christ to be our all, we must be terminated. It is only through the cross that Christ can enter into us and become our all.</p>
<p>Without the cross, Christ and His life would not have been released and could not have entered into us. Without the cross, we could not have been terminated, and therefore, Christ could not become our all. The cross is needed in order for Christ to be released and to enter into us, and the cross is needed in order for us to be terminated so that Christ can be everything to us. The accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s release occurred on the mount of Golgotha, and the accomplishment of our termination is occurring in us today.</p>
<p>God accomplished His purpose concerning Christ on the cross at Golgotha, and He is applying what He accomplished in Christ on the cross to us. God is still doing the work of the cross in us. He wants us to accept the cross so that Christ may enter into us and so that we may be terminated in order for Christ to become everything to us. God&rsquo;s purpose will be accomplished in anyone who receives the cross.</p>
<p>Whenever we accept the cross, Christ becomes everything to us. The cross is still the means by which God fulfills His purpose. Through the cross God opens a way for Christ to enter into us to be our life, and through the cross we are terminated so that Christ can gain the ground and authority in us and become our all. From the day that we received salvation, God has been working in us through the cross to terminate us so that we may decrease, and He has been working to add Christ into us so that Christ may increase and grow until He becomes our all. This is how God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is fulfilled in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE REALITY<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION THROUGH THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The riches of God&rsquo;s salvation are in Christ, and the reality of these riches is also in Christ. The cross is the way for us to enjoy and experience the riches of God&rsquo;s salvation, because we gain Christ through the cross. Although everything in God&rsquo;s salvation has become our portion in Christ, this portion becomes our practical enjoyment only through the cross. In other words, although everything in God&rsquo;s salvation is ours in Christ, we must experience the cross in order to enjoy these riches.</p>
<p>The main blessings in God&rsquo;s salvation are His sanctifying life, the power of resurrection, the operation of the Spirit, and the presence of God. We can enjoy these items only through our experience of the cross. In order for us to practically experience and enjoy the blessings of salvation, the Spirit continually enables us to know and accept the working of the cross in order to kill, eliminate, and terminate us. This is the only way for us to taste the riches of His sanctifying life, the power of His resurrection, the operation of the Spirit, and the presence of God. When we accept the work of the cross to kill, eliminate, and terminate us, Christ will fill us, and we will enjoy the riches of the blessings in God&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BRINGING THE CROSS TO US</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 3:10; 2 Cor. 4:10-12; Rom. 8:13</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the cross brings Christ to us; that is, we receive Christ when we receive the cross. In this chapter we will see that Christ brings the cross to us. This means that when we let Christ live in us, we will experience the cross.</p>
<p>Philippians 3:10 says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; Knowing Christ is connected to being conformed to His death, and being conformed to His death follows knowing Him. Hence, being conformed to His death is the issue of knowing Him. Knowing Christ causes us to be conformed to His death. The meaning of the phrase <em>being conformed to His death</em> in Greek is &ldquo;being made of like form with His death.&rdquo; This does not mean that we should make an effort to imitate His death in order to know Him. Rather, it means that our knowledge of Christ puts us into His death. Christ&rsquo;s death is likened to a mold, and we are put into the mold of His death so that our living and walk would have the same form as His death. This is to be conformed to the death of Christ.</p>
<p>Being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death does not mean that we use our strength to imitate Christ in His enduring of sufferings and in His being put to death. Rather, it means that in our living knowledge of the resurrected Christ, the power of His resurrection life enables us to live in His death and to live out the form of His death.</p>
<p>If we use our own strength to imitate Christ&rsquo;s death, we will produce a type of behavior that is based only on our human effort. However, the power of the resurrection life of Christ puts us in His death and enables us to live out the form of His death. This life is lived out through His resurrection life, and our living matches Christ&rsquo;s living, because it is conformed to His death. Such a living has the form of His death but is full of the elements of His life, because it comes from the power of His resurrection life in us. When we know the resurrected Christ, live by Him, and let Him live in us, His resurrection life brings us into His death so that we may live in His death and live out the form of His death. Therefore, when Christ lives in us, we are brought into the experience of His death. When Christ lives in us, He brings the cross to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE OF CHRIST<br />
HAVING THE ELEMENT OF DEATH</h2>
<p>The life of Christ contains the element of death. This matter is difficult to explain, and it is not easy to comprehend. The life of Christ is a resurrected and indestructible life that contains the element of His death. This intrinsic truth is revealed in the Bible and confirmed by our experience (v. 10; 2 Cor. 4:10-12; Rom. 8:13).</p>
<p>Philippians 3:10 unveils that the resurrected Christ lives in us and brings us into His death so that we may live in His death and be conformed to it. If Christ did not have the element of death, then He could not bring us into His death, and we could not live in His death or live out the form of His death. Just as the life of Christ enables Him to live in us, His life brings us into His death. In other words, through His life Christ lives in us and brings us into His death. Hence, His life contains the element of death.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:10-12 says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.&rdquo; According to these verses, the death of Jesus operates in us. In order for death to operate in us, it must operate through His life in us. The issue of the operation of the Lord&rsquo;s death in us confirms this conclusion. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.&rdquo; This indicates that the result of the operation of the Lord&rsquo;s death in us is that the Lord&rsquo;s life is manifested in us. Since the operation of the Lord&rsquo;s death results in the manifestation of His life, this operation must come out of His life; that is, His life must be the source. Hence, verse 10 reveals that the Lord&rsquo;s life contains the element of death.</p>
<p>Romans 8:13 speaks of putting to death the practices of the body by the Spirit in order to live. The Spirit in verse 13 refers to the Spirit of life in verse 2. The Spirit of life dwells in us so that we would not be fleshly or live according to the flesh but that we would put to death the practices of the body (vv. 9-13). Since the Spirit of life can cause us to put to death the practices of the body, He must give us a putting-to-death power. Such a power can be related only to the power of the Lord&rsquo;s death. This power is given to us by the Spirit of life who dwells in us; hence, this power is given to us by the Spirit through and from the life of Christ. On the one hand, Christ dwells in us as the Spirit of life, and His life saves us from living according to the flesh. On the other hand, His life possesses a putting-to-death power that operates in us to put to death the practices of our body. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s life contains the element of death.</p>
<p>If we consider our experience, we will realize that the Lord&rsquo;s life in us has the element of death. When we live in His life and allow Him to operate and live in us through His life, we often sense the power of His resurrection reviving and strengthening us inwardly and also the power of His death killing and eliminating us. Such experiences prove that the Lord&rsquo;s life contains the element of His resurrection as well as the element of His death.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIFE OF CHRIST HAVING THE KILLING POWER</h2>
<p>The life of Christ contains the element of His death; therefore, this life has the effectiveness of His death, which is a killing power. This killing power operates in us through His life to kill everything in us that is not of Christ, that is, everything that is not spiritual or heavenly. To put to death (v. 13; Col. 3:5) is the application of this killing power in us. We put to death the practices of the body and our sinning members on the earth not by our own strength but by living in the Lord&rsquo;s life. When we allow His life to operate as the killing power in us, our obedience issues in His applying the effectiveness of His death to us. This is the Lord working to put us to death. While the work of putting to death seemingly is done by us, it is actually an operation of the Lord as life in us. In truth, our obedience to the Lord is our acceptance of His death, and when His death is applied, we are put to death.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:10 says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus.&rdquo; This means that the death of the Lord Jesus is a putting to death, a killing, and that it will always do the work of putting to death, the work of killing. This killing is the issue of the element of death contained in the Lord&rsquo;s life. Hence, this killing is an effect of the Lord&rsquo;s death according to the power of His life. Because the Lord has passed through death and resurrection, His life contains the elements of death and resurrection. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s life contains the power of resurrection and also a killing power; it gives life to man and also kills the negative things in man.</p>
<p>Many saints think that the Lord&rsquo;s life contains only the element of resurrection. According to the revelation of the Bible and according to our experience, however, the Lord&rsquo;s life contains the elements of His death and His resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s life has the element of His resurrection and the element of His death. Unless we see this, we will think that the Lord&rsquo;s life has the power only to enliven but does not have the power to kill the things in us that do not match Him. If we see that the Lord&rsquo;s life has passed through death and resurrection and that it possesses both the element of death and the element of resurrection, we will recognize that the Lord&rsquo;s life not only gives us life but also kills the negative things in us. His life enlivens our spirit, soul, and body&mdash;our whole being&mdash;and fills us with God&rsquo;s life. This life also puts to death the elements of the old creation, our flesh, and everything that is incompatible with Christ.</p>
<p>The blood in our body has the strength to supply nutrients and the power to kill germs. When blood circulates in our body, it supplies nutrients to meet the needs of our body and also kills the germs in our body. This is an example of the moving of the Lord&rsquo;s life in us. The element of resurrection in the Lord&rsquo;s life supplies us to meet our needs, and the element of death in the Lord&rsquo;s life kills the things that should not be in us. Hence, the killing effect of the Lord&rsquo;s death in us cannot be separated from the supply of the Lord&rsquo;s life in us. We experience the Lord&rsquo;s death through the supply of the Lord&rsquo;s life. When we allow the Lord&rsquo;s life to move in us, supply us, and live in us, His life spontaneously does a killing work in us so that we experience His death. Our having died with Christ in Romans 6:8 becomes our practical experience through the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2. The Spirit of life applies the killing of the Lord&rsquo;s death to us so that there is a putting to death in our body. The Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross can be applied to us only through His life in us. We experience the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross through experiencing His life in us.</p>
<p>When I first received light concerning the experience of the Lord&rsquo;s death being through His life, I did not have the boldness to speak about it, because I had never heard anyone say this. Later this revelation became clearer to me, and I received confirmation from the co-workers. I also read a book entitled <em>The Spirit of Christ</em> by Andrew Murray, which says, &ldquo;The life of Christ in us brings with it the death, the unceasing making dead of sin&rdquo; (Day 19, note 2). I was very happy when I read this. The life of Christ contains the element of death, and by this life a power continually kills and puts to death. As long as we are willing to let this power operate in us, it will work to continually kill, put to death, and eliminate anything in us that is contrary to Christ, that is, anything improper and inappropriate.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESURRECTION POWER OF CHRIST<br />
CONFORMING US TO HIS DEATH</h2>
<p>It is through the life of Christ that His death operates in us, and it is through His resurrection power that we experience His death and are conformed to His death. His life in us is His resurrection power. This resurrection power applies the death that the Lord accomplished on the cross to us so that we may live in His death and bear its likeness, thereby being conformed to His death. This is revealed in Philippians 3:10. In order to be conformed to the death of Christ, we need to know not only Christ but also the power of His resurrection. By knowing Christ and the power of His resurrection we can be conformed to His death, because the power of His resurrection applies His death to us.</p>
<p>We can partake of Christ&rsquo;s death because we partake of Christ. He enters into us in His resurrection. Since we are joined to Him, we can partake of His death. In His incarnation He was joined to humanity. Then through His death and resurrection, He imparted His life into us so that we could be joined to Him. Through this joining we can participate in His death, and His death becomes our death. We can die with Him because we are joined to Him as one (1 Cor. 6:17). We are joined to the Lord by His resurrection and in His resurrection life. In His resurrection we were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3); His life was imparted into us so that we could partake of Him and be joined with Him as one. The Lord Jesus has made it possible for us to partake of His death and for His death to become our death. His resurrection has brought His death to us, and His resurrection life, His resurrection power, applies His death to us so that we may experience His death and be conformed to it.</p>
<p>When the resurrected Christ entered into us, we sensed the effect of His killing work in putting us to death. We also sensed many negative things within us being put to death. When we allow Christ in His resurrection life and power to live in us, we sense the operation of His killing power. This power kills our self, our flesh, and everything that He condemns. The more we allow the power of His resurrection to operate in us, the more His resurrection life applies His death to us. His resurrection life causes us to experience His death and be conformed to it; that is, His resurrection life puts us into the mold of His death so that we may bear its likeness.</p>
<p>The resurrected Christ enlivens us and also puts us to death. The more He lives in us, the more He puts us to death. The more His resurrection life lives in us, the more its killing power operates in us. Those who allow Christ to live in them experience the killing work of His death. The living Christ brings us to the killing of His cross. The operation of His resurrection life conforms us to His death.</p>
<p>If we do not allow Christ to live in us, we will be ignorant of our flesh, our self, and our natural constitution, but if we consecrate ourselves to the Lord and let Him live in us, our flesh, our self, and our natural constitution will be manifested to us. When our flesh, our self, and our natural constitution are manifested, the Lord will require us to put them to death. If we are willing to obey, His resurrection life will operate in us to bring forth the killing power of His death to our flesh, our self, and our natural constitution. Christ applies the cross to us so that we may experience His death in His resurrection life. When His death is planted in us and grows into our living, we will bear the likeness of His death with the full measure of His stature.</p>
<p>If we allow Christ to live in us, allow His resurrection life to operate in us, and allow Him to be our life and to live out of us, we will experience His death and be conformed to the mold of His death. The resurrection life of Christ will bring us to death and require that we pass through death. If we are faithful to live by the resurrection life of Christ and fulfill its requirements, everything that we are will be brought to the cross and gradually terminated so that Christ may be formed in us. Christ brings His death to us, and the death of Christ adds Him to us. Hence, Christ gives us the cross, and the cross gives us Christ.</p>
<p>Christ brings us to the cross, and the cross ushers us into Christ. Christ and the cross cannot be separated; one is the cause, and the other is the effect. When Christ comes, the cross comes, and when Christ reigns, the cross reigns. Christ&rsquo;s work in us is measured by the effect of the cross in us. Christ always brings the cross, and the cross always ushers in Christ. The work of the cross in us determines how much Christ we gain. The extent to which we have been emptied by the cross is the extent to which we can be filled with Christ. The extent of the termination of the cross in us is the extent to which Christ&rsquo;s life can increase in us. If we want to gain Christ, we must accept the cross, and if we want to experience the cross, we must let Christ live in us.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life brings His death to us and becomes the power for us to experience His death. <em>Hymns,</em> #481 says, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not hard to die with Christ / When His risen life we know; / &rsquo;Tis not hard to share His suff&rsquo;rings / When our hearts with joy o&rsquo;erflow. / In His resurrection power / He has come to dwell in me, / And my heart is gladly going / All the way to Calvary.&rdquo; This hymn expresses the meaning of Philippians 3:10. The resurrection life of Christ conforms us to the death of Christ. When we know Christ and the power of His resurrection, we experience His death, live in His death, and are conformed to His death.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CROSS AND THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:16-18, 21-25; Eph. 2:14-15; Col. 3:9-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING OUT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In a previous chapter we saw that the church is out of Christ. The church comes out of Christ and is a part of Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam and was a part of Adam. Anything that was not of Adam was not Eve. In the same way, anything that is not of Christ is not the church. Eve was built out of Adam&rsquo;s rib, a part of Adam (Gen. 2:21-23), and the church is built out of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life, a part of Christ (John 19:34-36). When Peter received a revelation from God that the Lord Jesus was &ldquo;the Christ, the Son of the living God,&rdquo; the Lord told Peter that He would build the church upon Himself as the rock (Matt. 16:16-18). The Lord builds the church through His resurrection life, and the church that is built upon Him is one with Him because of His resurrection life. The resurrection life of Christ is just Christ Himself.</p>
<p>On the cross Christ released His resurrection life in order to produce the church. As a result, the church shares one life with Christ and is a part of Christ. This is the way that the church is built upon Christ and is one with Him. Eve was one with Adam because she was built from Adam&rsquo;s rib, which was just Adam. Eve was part of Adam, out of Adam, and shared one life with Adam. Only that which was out of Adam could be joined to him, and only that which was of Adam could become one flesh with him. Likewise, only that which is out of Christ can be joined to Christ and built upon Christ, and only that which is of Christ can be one with Christ. Without Adam there would be no Eve, and without Christ there would be no church. A rib had to be taken out of Adam in order for Eve to be built. Similarly, Christ&rsquo;s life had to be released in order for the church to be produced.</p>
<p>May God give us the spiritual vision to see that the church is absolutely out of Christ. The church is the fullness of Christ, the overflow of Christ, and, thus, a part of Christ. The church can be built upon Christ and joined as one to Christ because the church is built with the resurrection life of Christ. In order to know the church, the nature of the church, and the relationship between the cross and the church, we must see that the church is produced by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life and constituted with Christ. Then we will comprehend the necessity of the cross in relation to the existence of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING PRODUCED<br />
THROUGH THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The life that produced the church was released through the cross. The church is out of Christ, and it is produced through the cross. The church was brought forth in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life, but the church was produced through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross. Christ produced the church with His life through His death on the cross. If we only had the life of Christ, the church could not come into being. In order for the church to come into existence, there was the need for Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross. The life of Christ had to pass through death on the cross before it could be released to produce the church.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16, after the disciples heard that He was the Christ, the Lord told them that He had to pass through the death on the cross in order for the church to come out of Him and be built upon Him (vv. 15-18, 21). After Peter confessed that the Lord was the Christ, the Lord said that He would build the church upon Himself. This means that the church would come out of Him, be joined to Him, and be one with Him. After this revelation the Lord spoke to the disciples about the cross on many occasions (20:18-19; 26:2). The church was born of Christ and built upon Him, but He had to pass through death on the cross in order for His life to be released for the producing of the church. In order for His life to be released, Christ had to die on the cross. This is the reason that He spoke of the cross after speaking of the producing and the building of the church. The church cannot be produced or built without the cross. In a sense, it is not sufficient to have Christ; we need the cross as well. For its existence the church needs Christ and the cross. Christ could produce the church because He released His life through His death on the cross.</p>
<p>Eve came out of Adam after he fell asleep and his side was opened. Eve was built from Adam&rsquo;s rib, but Adam had to fall asleep, and his side had to be opened in order for a rib to be taken from him. Adam&rsquo;s sleep typifies Christ&rsquo;s death, but not in its redemptive aspect. Christ had to die, and His side had to be opened so that the church could be produced. Adam&rsquo;s rib had to be taken out of him in order to build Eve, and Christ&rsquo;s life had to be released from within Him in order to produce the church. Adam slept in order for Eve to be brought forth, and Christ died for the church to be produced. A rib was taken out of Adam so that it could be built into Eve, and life flowed out from Christ so that it could produce the church.</p>
<p>The church was produced by Christ through the cross. Without Christ there would be no church, but without the cross there still would be no church. The church cannot be separated from Christ, and the producing of the church cannot be separated from the cross. The church is out of Christ and dependent on Christ, but the church was produced through the cross. The church came out of the life of Christ, but this life had to pass through death on the cross. The church was produced by Christ&rsquo;s life passing through death on the cross. In order to know the church, we need to know Christ and we need to know the cross. In order to see the church and live in its reality, we need to know Christ and the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Since the church came out of Christ, it is a new creation in the universe. This new creation is the new man, the corporate man, whom Christ created in Himself on the cross. According to Ephesians 2:11-12, the Gentiles in the flesh in the old creation were apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise. Through the cross, however, both the Gentiles and the Jews were reconciled in one Body to God through the cross, &ldquo;that He might create the two in Himself into one new man&rdquo; (vv. 15-16). Through the cross Christ terminated the old creation with its distinction between Gentiles and Jews, and through the cross Christ imparted His life into the Gentile and Jewish believers, making them one new man in Himself in the new creation. This corporate new man is the church as the Body of Christ. Hence, the church is a new creation, a new man, created in Christ through the cross. Everything in this corporate man is new because this man is of Christ, who is new. There is nothing old in the new man, because it does not have any element of Adam. All the believers are part of this new man, because the element of the old creation that belonged to Adam was terminated by the cross of Christ. The cross of Christ terminated everything of the old creation and everything that belongs to Adam, and the cross of Christ imparted the life of Christ, which is Christ Himself, making the believers a new creation, a new man, in Christ. Colossians 3:9-10 speaks of this, saying, &ldquo;You have put off the old man with his practices and have put on the new man.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING EVERYTHING TO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:9-10 Paul says that those who are in the church have put off the old man and put on the new man. In verse 11 he says that in the new man &ldquo;there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; This verse clearly says that in the church as the new man there cannot be Gentiles, that is, Greeks, and Jews, barbarians, Scythians, slaves, or free men; there can be only Christ. In the church as the new man, there is nothing but Christ. The church as the new man is the overflow of the life of Christ. It is a part of Christ and therefore is just Christ Himself. All those who are in the church were terminated on the cross of Christ, and everything that belongs to them also was terminated on the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 11 does not speak of there being no distinction between Gentile and Jew, slave and free man, but of there being no Gentile and Jew, no slave and free man. The church is not a matter of there being no distinction but a matter of there &ldquo;not being.&rdquo; The church is not a matter of there being no distinction between Gentiles and Jews but of there being no Gentile and Jew. It is not a matter of there being no distinction between Chinese and foreigners, northerners and southerners, rich and poor, noble and base, but of there being no Chinese and foreigners, no northerners and southerners, no rich and poor, no noble and base. In the church there is only Christ. Everyone in the church has been terminated by the cross. The cross deals with everything and releases only the life of Christ, which is Christ Himself, to produce the church. Therefore, the church is just Christ. The church is Christ alone. In the church there can be only Christ. Anything that is of us or out from us is not of the church. Only Christ is the church.</p>
<p>A brother who knows the Lord said it well: &ldquo;The cross is our entrance into the church. Everyone who comes into the church must pass through the cross.&rdquo; Indeed, we cannot enter into the church in ourselves. When we bring ourselves and our things into the church, the church loses its nature and taste. The things of man cause the church to lose its nature and taste. The church is not of man but of Christ. In the church there can be only Christ. Both man and the things of man were dealt with and terminated on the cross. Christ is all in the church. In the church there can be only Christ. Whatever is not of Christ or is apart from Christ is not the church. As soon as the things of man enter into the church, whether it is the flesh, temper, opinions, practices, intelligence, capabilities, virtues, or strengths, the church loses its nature of being only of Christ. Thus, it is no longer the church of Christ but an organization of man.</p>
<p>Man and all that he has are enemies of the church, opposing the church and fighting against the church. Man and everything of man must be terminated by the cross, annulled by the cross, and blocked by the cross from coming into the church, so that Christ can be everything in the church. In this way the nature of the church, which is of Christ, can be preserved, and the characteristic of the church, which is Christ, can be manifested. Temperament and personality, whether good or bad, must be dealt with by the cross. Wisdom, ability, intent, and purpose, whether good or bad, must be removed by the cross. Ambition, aspiration, and everything of us, whether valuable or not, must be broken and eliminated by the cross so that Christ can be everything to us. Only in this way can we express Christ as the nature of the church and live out Christ as the reality of the church. Our experience of the cross is the practical living of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CROSS<br />
BEING THE PRACTICAL LIVING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The reality of the church is Christ. The practical living of the church is the living out of Christ. If we want to live out Christ, we must be broken and dealt with by the cross. Only the breaking and dealing of the cross can cause us to live out Christ, and only the breaking and dealing of the cross can cause us to live out the reality of the church. The breaking and dealing of the cross bring in Christ and the reality of the church. Christ lives out from those who have been broken and dealt with by the cross, and only such ones have the practical living of the church.</p>
<p>May the Lord show us that Christ is the reality of the church. To live out the reality of the church, we must live out Christ. To live out Christ, we must experience the cross. The cross terminates everything that is of us and imparts everything that is of Christ into us, thereby producing the church. From the time that we were saved and received Christ, God has been doing a breaking and terminating work in us through the cross so that Christ can grow and be formed in us and so that the church can be built up. When we were saved, the cross added Christ into us, but after we were saved, the cross has also been doing a subtracting work in us. The cross subtracts our flesh, our temper, our sins, the world, wisdom, power, human abilities, human methods, the old creation, our natural being, and everything of Adam. Although the cross has been doing a work of subtraction in us, the final issue will be a display of the life and riches of Christ as the reality and stature of the church. The cross subtracts everything that we are so that we can receive everything that Christ is. Only by our experiencing the cross can Christ increase in the church and cause the growth of the church practically.</p>
<p>For this reason, only the cross can enable us to live out Christ and to live out the reality of the church. The subtraction of the adamic life in our being opens the way for the addition of the reality of Christ. The more Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross is applied to our adamic life, the more Christ will be lived out in the church. When we allow the cross to kill everything of Adam in us, Christ will become the reality of the church. However, if we continue to live in Adam, the self, and the old creation, the reality of the church&mdash;Christ&mdash;will be nullified by us, and the church will not be manifested. We must deny the self, condemn the old creation, and reject everything of Adam so that the reality of the church will be manifested among us. This reality is just Christ Himself. Zeal, love, and other good traits are not the reality of the church. Only Christ is the reality of the church. If we learn to reject the self and the old creation and allow the cross to terminate everything of the old man, the reality of the church will surely be manifested among us. Then, when we gather together and people come into our midst, they will touch Christ, the reality of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CROSS AND THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 17:6; John 7:38-39; Matt. 3:16; Gal. 5:16-17, 24-25; Heb. 9:14; Rom. 8:13-14</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING CONNECTED TO THE CROSS</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we saw the relationship between Christ and the cross. In this chapter we will look at the relationship between the Spirit and the cross. Christ and the cross are inseparable, and the Spirit and the cross are inseparable as well. Both the Old Testament types and the New Testament revelation reveal that the Spirit is connected to the cross. Furthermore, our experiences prove that the Spirit and the cross are inseparable. If we have the cross, we have the Spirit, and if we have the Spirit, we have the cross. Without the cross there is no Spirit, and without the Spirit there is no cross. The cross cannot be separated from the Spirit. We should note that when we speak of the Spirit and the cross being inseparable, we are referring to our experience of the Spirit and the cross. In our experience the Spirit and the cross are inseparable. Whether we are experiencing the Spirit, or the Spirit is leading us to receive a spiritual blessing, the Spirit cannot be separated from the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT COMING THROUGH THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that the Spirit enters into man and comes upon man through the cross. The Spirit comes from God, but He passes through the cross in order to reach man and to enter into man. John 7:38-39 says, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; First Corinthians 10:4 says, &ldquo;All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo; According to these two passages, the water that the children of Israel drank out of the rock in the wilderness typifies the Spirit (Exo. 17:6). Before water could flow out and be enjoyed by the children of Israel, the rock had to be struck. The striking of the rock typifies Christ&rsquo;s being crucified. This shows that the Spirit flows out of Christ as living water for us to receive and enjoy through the cross.</p>
<p>John 7:38-39 says that the Spirit could not be received as living water until Christ was glorified. In order for the Spirit to be received, Christ had to be glorified. Christ&rsquo;s glorification refers to His resurrection from among the dead. After Christ was raised from among the dead, He entered into glory (Luke 24:26). In order to enter into glory, Christ had to pass through the cross, that is, to pass through death. Therefore, the Spirit could be received and gained by man as living water only after Christ was crucified on the cross. Even though the Holy Spirit exists, He could not be received and enjoyed by man without Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross. The Spirit could flow out as the living water of life into man for man&rsquo;s enjoyment only after Christ, as the eternal spiritual rock, was struck on the cross (John 19:34). The Spirit flowed out through Christ&rsquo;s death. The eternal Spirit passed through the cross so that He could be gained and experienced by man.</p>
<p>The Spirit passed through the cross in order to be received by us. This principle applies to us, as it applied to the Lord Jesus. The Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus after His baptism (Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:9-10). Baptism typifies the death of the cross. The descending of the Spirit upon the Lord after His baptism signifies that a person must pass through the cross before he can receive the Spirit. The Spirit can be gained and experienced only by a person who passes through the cross.</p>
<p>The descension of the Spirit follows the operation of the cross. The Lord breathed the Spirit of life into the disciples on the evening of His resurrection (John 20:19-22), and the Spirit of power was poured upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost, fifty days after His resurrection (Acts 2:1-4). Both the resurrection and Pentecost occurred after the Lord&rsquo;s death at Golgotha (John 19:17-18). In our experience there is first the cross and then the Spirit. There must be crucifixion before there can be the receiving of the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power. This is a great principle: the Spirit comes through the cross, and the Spirit is gained and experienced through the cross. The cross enables us to experience the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS ENABLING US TO EXPERIENCE THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The cross enables us to gain and experience Christ, and the cross enables us to gain and experience the Spirit. We gain Christ and experience Christ through the cross, and we also gain the Spirit and experience the Spirit through the cross. Now that the Spirit has descended, He guides us to know Christ&rsquo;s redemption and moves us to receive this redemption. As soon as a person believes, he receives the redemption of the cross, and the Spirit enters into him as the Spirit of life to regenerate him (Acts 2:36-39). The Spirit then leads the believer to gain and experience more of the Lord through the cross. The more a believer receives and experiences the cross and the more he is broken and dealt with by the cross, the more ground the Spirit will have in him. This issues in his gaining and experiencing more of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Spirit enters into a believer based on the redemption of the cross, and the Spirit increases and spreads in a believer through the dealings of the cross. Based on the redemption of the cross, the Spirit enters a believer as life. Furthermore, the Spirit is manifested as power and authority in a believer through the dealing of the cross. Whether inwardly as life or outwardly as power, a believer gains and experiences the Spirit through the cross. The cross opens the way for us to gain and experience the Spirit. The cross always opens the way for the Spirit to gain ground in us so that we would gain and experience the Spirit. The cross is the means for the Holy Spirit to work in us. In order for us to gain and experience the Spirit, we must pass through the cross. The Spirit and the cross are inseparable. We cannot gain and experience the Spirit apart from the cross.</p>
<p>Galatians 5:16 says, &ldquo;Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh,&rdquo; and verse 24 says, &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.&rdquo; Even though a believer has received the divine life and the Spirit dwells in him, he may not walk by the Spirit. Walking by the Spirit requires the cross. After a person is saved, he must see that his flesh has been crucified on the cross and acknowledge his co-crucifixion with Christ by putting to death his flesh with its passions and lusts by the Spirit who dwells in him. Then he can live and walk by the Spirit (v. 25). Before a believer can walk by the Spirit, he must stand in the death of the cross and put to death the flesh with its passions and lusts. In order to walk by the Spirit, a believer must apply by the Spirit the crucifixion of the cross to his flesh. The Spirit works in us and gains ground in us through the cross, and we also experience the Spirit&rsquo;s power and enjoy His presence through the cross.</p>
<p>The cross enables us to live by the Spirit and to walk by the Spirit. If our flesh with its passions and lusts is not put to death through the cross, the Spirit cannot gain any ground in us. Without having the ground in us, the Spirit will not be our power for our living and walk, and He will not have the opportunity to supply us with Christ&rsquo;s life. Our flesh fights against the Spirit, who indwells us (v. 17). If we do not put our flesh to death through the cross, the Spirit cannot prevail to be our power and life. If we do not apply the crucifixion of the cross to our flesh, we cannot live and walk by the Spirit. The experience of the cross is necessary for our experience of the Spirit. If we want to experience the Spirit, we should not avoid or disregard the cross, because the Spirit is connected to the cross. The Spirit is gained and experienced through the cross.</p>
<p>The disciples, the first group of people to gain and experience the Spirit in the New Testament, passed through the cross. The disciples passed through the cross and then received and experienced the Spirit. They first passed through the Lord&rsquo;s death at Golgotha (John 19:17-18), and they received and experienced the Spirit on the evening of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and when He descended upon them on Pentecost (20:19-22; Acts 2:1-4). The disciples gained the Spirit of life inwardly and experienced the Spirit of power outwardly after passing through the cross. This is the order ordained by God and revealed in the Bible. The cross precedes our gaining and experiencing of the Spirit. Death precedes resurrection and Pentecost. The Spirit flowed out from God through the cross, and He flows into us through the cross. The cross leads us to gain and experience the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ, and He does the work that God desires to accomplish in us for the fulfillment of His eternal plan. If the cross does not deal with our flesh and break our self, the Spirit cannot accomplish anything in us, nor can He be experienced by us. In order for the Spirit to accomplish something in us and be experienced by us, the cross must be the base and the means for the Spirit&rsquo;s work. The Spirit can work in us and be experienced by us only when we accept the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT LEADING MAN TO EXPERIENCE THE CROSS</h2>
<p>According to Hebrews 9:14, Christ offered Himself without blemish to God through the eternal Spirit. The Lord Jesus offered Himself to God on the cross through the eternal Spirit of God. Hence, the Spirit led the Lord Jesus to the cross, to the place of death. In His baptism the Lord Jesus received the termination of the cross in order to receive the Spirit (Matt. 3:16). From the time of the Lord&rsquo;s baptism, the purpose of the Spirit&rsquo;s leading Him was for Him to remain in the condition of death in order to have a living and a walk according to the cross so that He could enter into the place of death and experience death on the cross. When the Lord received the termination of death through baptism, the Spirit descended upon Him as a dove. After descending upon the Lord, the Spirit led Him to experience the death of the cross. Under the leading of the Spirit, the Lord lived a life of the cross and walked the way of the cross for His entire life, until the Spirit brought Him to the cross to be put to death. The Lord&rsquo;s living and walk were entirely in the death of the cross. The death of the cross led Him to experience the Spirit, and the Spirit led Him to experience the cross.</p>
<p>Romans 8:13-14 says, &ldquo;If you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&rdquo; This shows that we put to death the practices of the body by the leading of the Spirit. Putting to death the practices of the body is the experience of the cross. We must receive the cross and allow the cross to put to death the practices of our body. These verses say that the Spirit leads us to receive the cross and to allow the cross to work in us. According to the context of Romans 8, the Spirit&rsquo;s leading is mainly related to our putting to death the practices of our body. The Spirit leads us to put to death the practices of the body, that is, to receive and experience the cross.</p>
<p>When we mind the Spirit, follow the Spirit, and live and walk by the law of the Spirit of life, we will sense that the Spirit is leading us continually into deeper experiences of the death of the cross. If we are faithful to obey the leading and guiding of the Spirit, He will lead us to experience the death of the cross day by day and even moment by moment. The more we obey the Spirit, the more He will lead us to experience the cross. The more we experience the cross, the more the cross will enable us to receive the Spirit. The Spirit and the cross interact with each other as both a cause and an effect. They continually deliver us from ourselves so that we may live in Christ. Their work will continue until we are mature in the life of Christ and arrive &ldquo;at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 4:13).</p>
<p>The cross gives us the Spirit, and the Spirit gives us the cross. The cross enables us to experience the Spirit, and the Spirit leads us to experience the cross. If we want to gain and experience the Spirit, we must accept the cross, and if we want to accept and experience the cross, we must depend on and obey the Spirit. Only the cross can give us the Spirit, and only the Spirit can bring us into the experience of the cross. Only by standing in the death of the cross can we experience the Spirit, and only by living in the Spirit can we experience the cross. The cross is the means of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the power of the cross. We must gain the Spirit through the cross, and we must experience the cross by the Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CROSS AND SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:14; Rom. 6:6-7; Gal. 6:14; 5:16-17, 24-25; Heb. 2:14; 10:19-20; Gal. 2:20; 1 Cor. 2:2, 4, 14-15; Matt. 16:23-24; Phil. 3:10-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES<br />
DEPENDING ON THE CROSS</h2>
<p>Spiritual experiences refer to experiencing what God has prepared for us in Christ. In order to experience what God has prepared for us, we must partake of Christ, and we can partake of Christ only through the cross. The cross brings Christ to us. We gain Christ and partake of Him only through the cross. The cross is the only way for us to experience what God has prepared for us in Christ. All our spiritual experiences come through the cross and depend on the cross. This is revealed in the Bible and confirmed in our experience.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament everything in the Tent of Meeting typifies Christ. This indicates that God wants Christ to be everything to us (Heb. 9:1-14). The way that the children of Israel entered into the Tent of Meeting to partake of everything in it portrays how we enter into Christ to partake of everything that God has prepared for us in Him. Those who entered into the Tent of Meeting had to first pass through the altar. They had to deal with their sins and all their problems before entering into the Tent of Meeting and partaking of everything in the Tent of Meeting. The altar typifies the cross. This indicates that we must first deal with our sins and problems through the cross before we partake of Christ. Before entering the Tent of Meeting, a person had to pass though the altar. Similarly, in order to enter into Christ to partake of everything in Him, a person must pass through the cross.</p>
<p>The altar was the largest piece of furniture in the Tent of Meeting (Exo. 27:1). Some scholars say that the altar could contain all the utensils in the Tent of Meeting. This indicates that all the blessings in Christ are obtained through the cross. When we experience the cross, we can partake of all the blessings in Christ. When we experience the death of the cross, we can experience everything that God has prepared for us in Christ. We can partake of the blessings in Christ and experience everything that God has prepared for us only through the cross. All our spiritual experiences depend on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND REGENERATION</h2>
<p>To be regenerated is to receive God&rsquo;s life into us, that is, to have another life, God&rsquo;s eternal life, in addition to our natural life (1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:16). Regeneration is the beginning of our spiritual experience, and it comes through the cross of Christ. When the children of Israel offended God and were bitten by fiery serpents in the wilderness, Moses lifted up a bronze serpent on a pole, and those who looked at the bronze serpent lived (Num. 21:4-9). We were dead in our sins, but when we looked at Christ on the cross, we were regenerated with God&rsquo;s eternal life (John 3:14-15). To be regenerated does not mean that we have &ldquo;mended our ways&rdquo; or &ldquo;turned over a new leaf.&rdquo; Neither is it a psychological exercise similar to the Chinese saying, which says, &ldquo;Everything in the past died yesterday, and everything is born today.&rdquo; Such a mindset does not require that we look at Christ on the cross; it requires a strong human will. Regeneration, however, is through the cross of Christ. At best, a strong will can change a person&rsquo;s outward conduct, but it cannot change his inner life; it cannot cause God&rsquo;s life to enter into him and regenerate him. Regeneration comes only through the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the cross of Christ redeems us, and on the other hand, the cross releases Christ&rsquo;s life. We were dead because of sin, but through Christ&rsquo;s redemption on the cross we can receive the life that He released on the cross and be regenerated and enlivened. Apart from the cross we have no way to be regenerated with God&rsquo;s divine, eternal life. The cross frees us from sin so that we can receive the life of God. All sinners have a deadened spirit; therefore, they need to be regenerated and enlivened in their deadened spirit. The cross of Christ is the means for our regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND DELIVERANCE FROM SIN</h2>
<p>Being delivered from sin, that is, overcoming sin, is a spiritual experience that we must have after being regenerated. No regenerated person should continue to live in sin. We must be delivered from sin. This is a commandment in God&rsquo;s Word and a demand of His life within us. God&rsquo;s life demands that we be delivered from sin, and God&rsquo;s nature does not allow us to continue to live in sin. Continuing to live in sin oppresses God&rsquo;s nature in us, making us miserable and uneasy. Being delivered from sin releases God&rsquo;s life in us, making us comfortable and at ease. As those who have been regenerated and who have God&rsquo;s life and nature, we must be delivered from sin. We can be delivered from sin only through the cross.</p>
<p>Romans 6:7 says, &ldquo;He who has died is justified from sin.&rdquo; This means that only a person who has died can be delivered from sin. A person can never be delivered from sin as long as he is still alive. In order to be delivered from sin, we must die. Once we die, we are delivered from sin. Without death, there is no way to be delivered from sin. No matter how much a person resolves, how much he endeavors, how much he afflicts himself, or how much contrition he expresses, he cannot deliver himself from sin. Only death delivers a man from sin.</p>
<p>Even though death is necessary, a believer does not need to try to die, because he has already died. A person who is dead does not need to die again. Romans 6:6 says, &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him.&rdquo; Those who are joined to Christ through faith are in Him, and therefore, they have been crucified with Him. We do not need to die again. We only need to see and believe that we have died with Christ. It is sufficient for us to confess this fact. The death of Christ has been applied to us; hence, we do not need to put ourselves to death. We have been crucified with Christ in His death on the cross; hence, we do not need to think of ways to crucify ourselves.</p>
<p>On the cross of Christ we were crucified together with Christ, and His death was a deliverance that only such a death can provide. When the cross of Christ crucified our old man, the body of sin was annulled so that we should no longer serve sin as slaves (v. 6), that is, so that we would no longer be bound by sin. To no longer be bound by sin is to be delivered from sin. Thus, the cross of Christ delivers us from sin. We are delivered from the bondage of sin when we believe and accept our death with Christ on the cross. Our experience of being delivered from sin comes from seeing and knowing our co-crucifixion with Christ.</p>
<p>When we confess and accept our co-death with Christ on the cross, when we are joined with the cross of Christ by faith, and when we live in the death of the cross of Christ, we will experience deliverance from sin. The experience of deliverance from sin is only through the cross of Christ. Being delivered from sin does not depend on our doing but on our seeing and accepting Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross. Just as regeneration does not depend on self-improvement but on seeing and accepting Christ&rsquo;s vicarious death on the cross, deliverance from sin does not depend on our resolving but on our seeing and accepting our co-crucifixion with Christ on the cross. When we accepted Christ&rsquo;s vicarious death on the cross, we experienced regeneration. Similarly, when we accept our co-crucifixion with Christ on the cross, we experience deliverance from sin.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND OVERCOMING THE WORLD</h2>
<p>Overcoming the world, or being delivered from the world, is also a spiritual experience that should follow a believer&rsquo;s regeneration. After being regenerated, a believer should be delivered from sin and from the world. The world is at enmity with God (James 4:4). All that is in the world is not of God and does not match His holy nature (1 John 2:16). No one who is born of God and who has God&rsquo;s life can love the world boldly or be at ease while loving the world. God&rsquo;s holy nature has made us incompatible with the things of the world. God&rsquo;s life in us demands that we be delivered from the world. First John 5:4 says, &ldquo;Everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world.&rdquo; The things that have been begotten of God are the believers who have God&rsquo;s life. Hence, those who have God&rsquo;s life can overcome the world. The nature of God&rsquo;s life demands that we be delivered from the world, and the power of God&rsquo;s life enables us to be delivered from the world. Being delivered from the world comes through the cross (Gal. 6:14).</p>
<p>Being delivered from sin comes through the cross, and being delivered from the world also comes through the cross. A person must be dead in order to be delivered from sin, and a person must be dead in order to be delivered from the world. Only the dead can be delivered from sin, and only the dead can be delivered from the world. The world can touch and attract every kind of person, but the world has no attracting power over dead persons. We thank God that we have been crucified together with Christ. We were delivered not only from sin but also from the world by Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross.</p>
<p>We were separated from the world by Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, just as the children of Israel were separated from the Egyptians by the Red Sea. Because of the Red Sea, the Egyptians were dead to the children of Israel, and the children of Israel were dead to the Egyptians (Exo. 14:21-31). Similarly, the world has been crucified to us and we to the world because of the cross of Christ (Gal. 6:14). Just as the waters of the Red Sea covered Egypt&rsquo;s army and caused it to perish, the cross of Christ destroyed the forces of the world. Just as the Red Sea annulled Egypt&rsquo;s power over the children of Israel, the cross of Christ annuls the world&rsquo;s power over us. When we accept the death of the cross of Christ, the world and the things in the world lose their power and effect on us. When we live in the death of the cross of Christ, we are delivered from the power and the usurpation of the world. Our experience of being delivered from the world and overcoming the world depends on the cross of Christ and is through the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND DEALING WITH THE FLESH</h2>
<p>After a person is saved, he should experience being delivered from sin and overcoming the world, and he should also experience dealing with the flesh. Sin is an offense to God and interrupts our fellowship with God, but the flesh prevents us from submitting to God and, thus, from pleasing God. The world causes us to be at enmity with God, and the flesh also causes us to be at enmity with God (Rom. 8:7-8). The flesh strives against the Spirit, who indwells us, to prevent us from walking by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16-17). The flesh is the biggest problem and the biggest frustration to our spiritual life. Just as the Amalekites frustrated the children of Israel in their journey through the wilderness (Exo. 17:8-16), the flesh frustrates us from advancing on our spiritual path. God charged the children of Israel to destroy the Amalekites, and He wants us to deal with our flesh.</p>
<p>God condemns the evil aspects of the flesh, but He also rejects the good aspects of the flesh. Man can commit evil sins by the flesh, and he can also seek to serve God by the flesh (Phil. 3:3-4). God is offended by sins in the flesh, and He abhors our service to Him in the flesh. God condemns the flesh, and those in the flesh cannot please God (Rom. 8:8). If we want to live in the spirit, serve God in spirit, or please God, we must deal with the flesh and put off the flesh.</p>
<p>We can deal with the flesh and put off the flesh only through the cross of Christ. Galatians 5:24 says, &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.&rdquo; Christ condemned and crucified the flesh on the cross. We must accept, believe, confess, and apply this fact to our flesh and to everything related to our flesh by the power of the Holy Spirit (v. 16). Objectively, we must believe that the flesh has been crucified on the cross of Christ, and subjectively, we must put to death our flesh with its passions and lusts by the power of the Holy Spirit. This is the way to deal with and put off our flesh. Putting to death our flesh and everything of the flesh by the Spirit, according to the fact accomplished by the cross of Christ, is the way to deal with the flesh and put off the flesh.</p>
<p>We must believe that the cross of Christ has crucified the flesh, and by the Spirit we must put to death the flesh with its passions and lusts under the crucifixion of the cross. Merely believing that the cross of Christ has crucified the flesh will not enable us to deal with the flesh or to put off the flesh. We must apply to our flesh the fact that the cross of Christ has crucified our flesh. We can deal with and put off the flesh only when we apply the crucifixion of Christ to our flesh by the Spirit, that is, when we let the crucifixion of Christ put our flesh and everything of the flesh to death. The experience of dealing with the flesh and putting off the flesh is through the cross of Christ and depends on the cross of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND OVERCOMING SATAN</h2>
<p>Overcoming Satan is another experience that a believer should have after being saved. God&rsquo;s plan includes our overcoming of Satan, who is God&rsquo;s unique enemy in the universe. The world and the flesh are at enmity with God, but they are out of Satan and belong to Satan. The world and the flesh are instruments and puppets used by Satan to resist God. Everything in the universe that is contrary to God and that opposes God is out of Satan and belongs to Satan. Satan is the aggregate of all resistance to God in the universe, and thus, he is God&rsquo;s greatest problem. Ever since Satan rebelled, everything that God has done in the universe has included the purpose of dealing with and destroying Satan.</p>
<p>In order to express His wisdom, God determined that man should deal with Satan through the cross (Eph. 3:10). As the Creator, God would not deal with a rebellious creature, Satan. Instead, God determined that created man would deal with Satan, a created archangel who rebelled (Isa. 14:12; Heb. 2:14). Satan knew that God created man to deal with him, so he came to the garden of Eden to ruin and deceive man shortly after man had been created (Gen. 3:1-13). At that time God judged Satan and said that the seed of the woman would bruise Satan on the head (v. 15). The seed of the woman is the incarnated Son of God, Jesus the Nazarene, who was born of a virgin (John 1:14; Matt. 1:22-25).</p>
<p>After Satan ruined the first man&mdash;Adam, whom God created to deal with Satan&mdash;God was incarnated to be the second man&mdash;Christ&mdash;in order to deal with Satan (1 Cor. 15:47). God sent His Son to deal with and destroy Satan (1 John 3:8). The Lord Jesus, however, did not deal with Satan as the Son of God; He dealt with Satan as the Son of Man. One reason for His becoming a man was to deal with Satan as a man in humanity. The Lord Jesus did not take the position of the Son of God when He dealt with Satan; rather, He took the position of the Son of Man (Matt. 4:3-4; Luke 4:3-4). He put on blood and flesh in order to be crucified as a man in the flesh so that through His crucifixion in the flesh, He might destroy Satan, who was joined to man&rsquo;s flesh. Thus, the Lord Jesus dealt a fatal blow to Satan (Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p>Through His death on the cross as a man, God destroyed the man-corrupting Satan. As the seed of the woman, He bruised the serpent on the head and gave Satan a deathblow. Only Christ&rsquo;s death as a man in the flesh on the cross was able to fatally deal with Satan. In order for us to deal with Satan, we must experience the death of His cross. The cross of Christ is our means to deal with Satan and overcome him.</p>
<p>When Satan corrupted man by enticing man to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he joined himself to man (Gen. 3:1-6). Thus, Satan is joined to fallen man in man&rsquo;s flesh. When the Lord Jesus, who was clothed in the flesh, was crucified, He crucified man&rsquo;s flesh and also destroyed Satan, who was joined to man&rsquo;s flesh. Therefore, when the flesh was crucified on the cross, Satan was also destroyed on the cross. When a person&rsquo;s flesh is put to death through the cross, Satan is destroyed as well. Just as dealing with the flesh and putting the flesh to death are through the cross, overcoming Satan and destroying Satan are also through the cross.</p>
<p>Through the cross Christ destroyed Satan. We should believe this fact, accept it, and apply it. By the Spirit we must apply the death of Christ that crucified the flesh and destroyed Satan so that Satan may be destroyed and annihilated in us. By applying the death of the cross and standing in His death, we can triumph over Satan and his authority of darkness (Col. 2:15). We cannot overcome Satan in ourselves, nor do we need to overcome him in ourselves. The Lord has already overcome Satan on the cross. Satan is an enemy who has already been defeated and destroyed on the cross. We only need to stand in our co-crucifixion with the Lord and hold fast the victory that the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion has won for us in order to triumph over Satan and his angels. When we stand in the death of the cross and triumph over Satan by the cross, we will overcome Satan. The experience of overcoming Satan is through the cross of Christ and depends on the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND CHRIST BEING LIVED OUT OF US</h2>
<p>Christ being lived out of us is the center of our spiritual experience. It is the most precious aspect of our spiritual experience, and it is the sweetest aspect of our spiritual experience. God saved us so that we would deal with Satan, on the negative side, and so that Christ would be lived out of us, on the positive side. We live Christ through the cross. When we received Christ as our Savior, He entered into us to be our life and to be lived out of us. However, He can be lived out of us only to the extent that we have been broken by the cross. If the cross has not dealt with our flesh, put our self to death, or broken our natural life, there is no way for Christ to be lived out of us.</p>
<p>Christ can be lived out of us only when we accept the breaking of the cross, letting the cross work on us and put our self and natural life to death. Christ can be lived out of us only if we can say, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). When His cross operates in us, the power of His life can be manifested from within us (2 Cor. 4:10). If we accept the dealing of the cross in every situation, Christ will be magnified in our body. Furthermore, if we accept the breaking of His cross, we will reach the point where we say that for us, &ldquo;to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). Christ is lived out of us and magnified in our body through the breaking of the cross (v. 20). The experience of living out Christ is always through the cross. There is no way for us to live out Christ apart from the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND EXPERIENCING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The experience of the Spirit is the life pulse of our spiritual experience; it has an exceedingly important place in our spiritual experience. In the last chapter we saw that the cross enables man to experience the Spirit. Based on the accomplishments of the cross, the Spirit descended (Matt. 3:16; John 7:38-39; Luke 24:26). Based on the accomplishments of the cross, the Spirit regenerates man and enters into man as the indwelling Spirit of life (1 Pet. 1:3; John 20:22). Based on the accomplishments of the cross, the Spirit also fills us within with the divine life and fills us without with spiritual power. We must pass through the cross in order to receive the Spirit as the Spirit of life and as the Spirit of power, and we must also pass through the cross to be filled inwardly with His life and filled outwardly with His power.</p>
<p>We must pass through the cross in order to be born of the Spirit, to live by the Spirit, to walk by the Spirit, and to work by the Spirit. We must pass through the cross to experience the Spirit. The only way to experience the Spirit is through the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND FAITH</h2>
<p>Faith is very important in our spiritual experiences. Genuine faith is not from us. Genuine faith is the faith of the Son of God worked into us by the Spirit, and this faith comes through the cross. Because the Spirit deals with our flesh, puts our self to death, and breaks our natural life through the cross, He can work the faith of the Son of God into us so that we live by His faith, not by our flesh, self, or natural life. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me,&rdquo; and he also says, &ldquo;The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.&rdquo; Paul had been crucified with Christ, and it was no longer he who lived. It was Christ who lived in him. Thus, he could have the faith of the Son of God and live by His faith. Christ lived in Paul, and Paul had the faith of Christ because he was crucified with Christ on the cross. Thus, Paul no longer lived by himself, nor could he live himself; instead, he lived by Christ, and he lived Christ. Paul lived by the faith of Christ.</p>
<p>Galatians 2:20 shows that we obtain the faith of Christ that enables us to live before God when our self is put to death by the cross and Christ lives in us. In order to have the faith that is out of the Son of God, our self must experience the breaking and crucifixion of the cross. Faith comes through the cross of Christ and depends on the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND PRAYER</h2>
<p>Prayer is another crucial matter in our spiritual experience. Prayer is not asking God for things related to ourselves according to our will; rather, it is asking God for things related to His will (Matt. 26:39-42). In a deeper sense, prayer is not our asking God for things but God asking in us and through us. To pray is to fellowship with God in spirit. When we pray, we must contact God in spirit (John 4:24). We can enter into such prayer after we experience the dealing and breaking of the cross (Heb. 10:19-20).</p>
<p>A person whose flesh has been dealt with and whose self has been broken by the cross will not pray according to his own will, asking God for things for himself. Instead, he will pray according to God&rsquo;s will, asking God for matters that concern God. For such a person, prayer is not a matter of asking God for things but of God asking in him and through him. Only a person in whom the veil of the flesh has been split can pray in spirit. To such a person, prayer involves fellowshipping with God, contacting God. Genuine, spiritual, and valuable prayer comes through the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND SPIRITUAL REVELATION</h2>
<p>Spiritual revelation is related to spiritual experience. Spiritual revelation is the base for spiritual experience. Spiritual experience often comes through spiritual revelation, and spiritual revelation is often gained through spiritual experience. Our spiritual experience often depends on the spiritual revelation that we have, and our spiritual revelation often depends on our spiritual experience. Hence, both spiritual experience and spiritual revelation are the cause and the effect of the other. In order to have spiritual experience, we must have spiritual revelation, and in order to have spiritual revelation, we must also have spiritual experience. Because spiritual experience comes through the cross, the spiritual revelation gained through experience must also come through the cross.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Corinthians, Paul said, &ldquo;I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified...My speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:2, 4). Paul knew only Christ, and this One crucified. Paul&rsquo;s proclamation was not in human words of wisdom; his instruction was by the Spirit. This is the receiving of spiritual revelation. Our own wisdom is the greatest hindrance to obtaining spiritual revelation. Just as our self and our flesh hinder us from being spiritual, our wisdom and cleverness hinder us from obtaining spiritual revelation. We must let the cross of Christ deal with our wisdom and cleverness; otherwise, we will not obtain spiritual revelation.</p>
<p>In order for a person to receive spiritual revelation, he must let the cross deal with his wisdom and cleverness, for only such a person can receive spiritual revelation. Our wisdom and cleverness must be dealt with and broken by the cross in order for us to receive spiritual revelation. May our wisdom and cleverness pass through the death of the cross so that we can receive spiritual revelation. The more the cross breaks our wisdom and cleverness, the easier it will be for us to receive spiritual revelation. Spiritual revelation is always received when the cross breaks our wisdom and cleverness.</p>
<p>Revelation is a spiritual matter. In verses 14 and 15 the apostle says, &ldquo;A soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God...and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually. But the spiritual man discerns all things.&rdquo; A soulish man is a natural person; he lives mainly in his soul and by his mind. Such a person cannot perceive spiritual things and cannot receive spiritual revelation. A spiritual man lives by his spirit and in the spirit; he does not live by his soul. Only such a person can discern spiritual things and receive spiritual revelation. In order to be such a person, we must let the cross deal with the wisdom and cleverness of our natural mind. Letting the cross deal with our soul enables us to live not by the soul but by the spirit and to not be soulish but to be spiritual. We perceive spiritual things and receive spiritual revelation only when the cross deals with our soul.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>Knowing God&rsquo;s will is a great matter in our spiritual life. No one can live a spiritual life without knowing God&rsquo;s will. Knowing God&rsquo;s will is a test to our spiritual life. The more we live a spiritual life, the more we will know God&rsquo;s will. In order to know God&rsquo;s will, we need to live a spiritual life, and in order to live a spiritual life, we need to know God&rsquo;s will. The self is the greatest hindrance to knowing God&rsquo;s will. The self represents us. Our will, ideas, insights, and views are elements of our self. Our self, including our will, ideas, insights, and views, is the greatest hindrance to knowing God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Knowing God&rsquo;s will requires that the self be rejected, denied, and broken. This can only be accomplished through the cross. We can reject and deny the self only through the cross. In Matthew 16:24 the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.&rdquo; According to this verse, denying the self is related to taking up the cross. To deny the self is to reject the self. To take up the cross is to accept the cross, to place one&rsquo;s self under the death of the cross. This verse shows that denying the self is related to the cross. In order for a person to deny the self, he must take up the cross, and in order for him to take up the cross, he must reject the self and accept the death of the cross. Only such a person can deny himself and reject his self, which is full of opinions. Only a person who denies and rejects the self through the cross and lets the cross break his opinions and assertions can care for God&rsquo;s will and know God&rsquo;s will instead of the will of the self (v. 23). Hence, knowing God&rsquo;s will comes through the cross and depends on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>To experience resurrection is to experience the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life, which is to experience His resurrection power. Experiencing resurrection is the deepest and highest spiritual experience, and it comes through the cross. Without the death of the cross, there can be no resurrection. Unless a grain of wheat dies, it cannot be made alive (John 12:24; 1 Cor. 15:36). If the death of Christ does not operate in us, the resurrection life, the life of Christ, will not be manifested in our body (2 Cor. 4:10). Unless the cross of Christ puts our natural life to death, we cannot experience the resurrection life of Christ. We must let the cross put us to death in order to experience the life and power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. When we accept the death of the cross and let the death of the cross operate in us, Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life and power will become our experience. We can be raised in resurrection if we are conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death. This is to experience Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Phil. 3:10-11).</p>
<p>Every item of our spiritual life is in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, every spiritual thing depends on God, and our God is in resurrection (Matt. 22:32; John 11:25). Therefore, the natural man must not touch anything related to the spiritual life with his natural life. The natural life must be broken by the cross before we can touch life and touch God in resurrection. How much we touch life, touch God, and experience resurrection depends entirely on whether we accept the breaking of the cross and experience the death of the cross. The death of the cross must do a deep work of putting everything that is natural in us to death so that the life of Christ and the power of His resurrection can bring us into spiritual matters. Then we will touch God and experience Him in resurrection.</p>
<p>Every spiritual experience depends on the cross and must be through the cross. May we learn to know the cross more, accept the cross more, and experience the cross more so that we can have rich spiritual experiences in resurrection. May God be gracious to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE<br />
OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:20; Rom. 8:13</h1>
<p>Christ and the cross are the center of God&rsquo;s eternal plan. God&rsquo;s plan depends on Christ and is for Christ. God&rsquo;s plan was accomplished on the cross and through the cross. We cannot be in God&rsquo;s plan without Christ, and we cannot obtain Christ without knowing and contacting the cross. In the preceding chapters we said that Christ is God&rsquo;s purpose and that the cross is God&rsquo;s procedure. We can obtain Christ only through the cross. Christ as God&rsquo;s purpose is all-inclusive, and the cross as God&rsquo;s procedure is universal. God&rsquo;s purpose depends on Christ, and God&rsquo;s procedure depends on the cross. We must pass through the cross in order to gain what God has planned in Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is our life, and the cross is our living. As our life, Christ leads us to live the life of the cross. If we want to obtain Christ, we must contact the cross and go through the cross. We obtain Christ through the cross, and we live out Christ through the cross. The cross gives us Christ, and Christ gives us the cross. Therefore, we must know and experience the cross in order to experience Christ. The cross is indispensable to our experience of Christ.</p>
<p>Every spiritual experience is obtained through the cross. Without the cross as the means, that is, without going through the cross, it is difficult to have genuine spiritual experiences. This indicates the importance and necessity of knowing and experiencing the cross. We must pursue and obtain the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEQUENCE OF KNOWING AND<br />
EXPERIENCING THE CROSS</h2>
<p>Although the knowledge and experience of the cross are the same for all God&rsquo;s children, there are two ways, in terms of sequence, for knowing and experiencing the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The First Way of Knowing and<br />
Experiencing the Cross</h2>
<p>The first way of knowing and experiencing the cross occurs when a new believer receives intense light to know that the cross has terminated everything. Such believers, from the beginning of their Christian life, see that the Lord wants to be their life and everything and that they have been dealt with and terminated on the cross. This light is intense, penetrating, and all-pervasive. These believers see that all things&mdash;Satan, the demons, the world, sin, the flesh, man, everything of the old creation, and everything fallen&mdash;have been dealt with and terminated on the cross. They see that Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross is all-inclusive. Their view of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross is so thorough and clear that they recognize that they themselves have been terminated. Under this intense light, they acknowledge the termination of their flesh, temper, naturalness, and self. The light they see concerning the cross is so great and intense that it seems to terminate all that they are. As a result, the things in their being, such as their temper and their flesh, lack their former strength.</p>
<p>As a result of this shining, everything of the old creation in these believers is terminated. Although they are still living in their body of flesh, they can sense the flesh, temper, and naturalness in their living and service. Nevertheless, their flesh, temper, and natural man are not active or prevailing, nor do these things have any ground in these believers. It is hard for the flesh to rise up, because it is under the killing of such great light. The intensity of the light that these believers received makes it hard for Satan to stir up their flesh in their living and work. The flesh, temper, naturalness, and self of these believers are under their feet, and they follow the Lord to walk the way of the cross. They walk on the pathway of the Lord with these things under their feet. These things are only under their feet because they have received the knowledge that everything in the old creation was terminated on the cross.</p>
<p>These believers see that God&rsquo;s evaluation of man&rsquo;s condition calls for death. Having received this clear vision, they no longer give opportunity or ground to their flesh, temper, naturalness, or self. The flesh, temper, naturalness, and self are under their feet because of the intensity of the shining of the light.</p>
<p>This is the superior way to know and experience the cross. In the past two thousand years of church history, at least one believer, the apostle Paul, gained the knowledge and experience of the cross in this manner. When he was on the way to Damascus, he saw an intense and penetrating light (Acts 9:3-9), which revealed to him that he had been terminated on the cross and that the whole old creation had been terminated as well.</p>
<p>The content of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles shows that he saw Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive and all-terminating death on the cross in the light from heaven that shined upon him that day. His knowledge of the cross was due to this intense shining, and he realized that his flesh, old creation, self, and naturalness had been terminated on the cross. Thus, in his Epistles he subsequently writes that all things belonging to Satan and the old creation have been crucified and terminated on the cross (1 Cor. 15:3; Heb. 2:14; Gal. 6:14; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; 5:24).</p>
<p>Although other believers may not have seen such an intense light, some have seen that everything of themselves was dealt with on the cross and that all things were terminated in the death of Christ. The light that these believers have seen concerning the cross is great. This way of knowing and experiencing the cross is superior.</p><h2 class="head2">The Second Way of Knowing and<br />
Experiencing the Cross</h2>
<p>Throughout church history only a few saints have come to know and experience the cross as Paul did. The majority of the saints, however, do not see such a great light when they are saved and constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love at the beginning of their Christian life. Such believers love and pursue the Lord, consecrate themselves to Him, and let Him gain ground in them. As a result of their consecration, the indwelling Spirit operates in them and enables them to sense the Lord&rsquo;s demands in every matter. The demands of the Lord are always related to death, that is, to experiencing the death of the cross in every matter. They may not have a deep sense of this demand from Him in the beginning, but gradually they have such experiences. Most believers know and experience the cross according to this sequence.</p>
<p>This way of knowing and experiencing the cross is inferior to the first way, the way of Paul&rsquo;s category. Believers in Paul&rsquo;s category see a great light at the time of their salvation. They see that the old creation, their flesh, their naturalness, and their self have been terminated on the cross. As a result, Christ has much ground in them to be their Lord in everything. The light that they see concerning the cross is so strong and thorough that it subdues their flesh, temper, naturalness, and self. However, most saints do not have this kind of knowledge and experience of the cross.</p>
<p>Most believers have a heart for the Lord after their salvation, so they consecrate themselves to Him with the desire to do something for Him and to be useful to Him. Because they draw near to the Lord and give Him an opening, the Spirit operates within them to give them a sense to deal with certain things. At first these demands relate to outward matters. However, the Lord gradually demands that they experience the death of the cross on the things in their inward being.</p>
<p>For example, when a newly saved brother consecrates himself to the Lord out of a desire to live for the Lord and to be useful to Him, the Spirit will give him a sense that the Lord is unwilling to use him because his love for movies has not been terminated. If by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, he deals with this matter, the Lord will have a way to touch the things that he wears. If the brother obeys this sense and submits to the Lord, he may receive a sense from the Lord regarding his temper being a hindrance to his usefulness to the Lord. When he receives this sense, he should confess and deal with his temper by giving it to the Lord. He should also condemn his temper.</p>
<p>Over time, such a brother will begin to be touched about deeper matters, such as his preferences, actions, and motives. The Spirit will not let him go in these matters. Whenever he expresses the self, the Spirit will give him a sense. For example, after giving a good testimony, he may feel proud and be exalted in his heart. Then the Spirit will touch him in regard to the presence of his self in the testimony, and he will sense his self-boasting and self-glorifying. If he is subdued by the Lord, he will confess his sins and ask for forgiveness. Later, when he and another brother express differing opinions while preaching the gospel, a voice within may say, &ldquo;You are so insistent on your opinion. Is this of yourself or of the Lord? Is it natural, or is it spiritual?&rdquo; When this brother senses that his insistence is of himself, not of the Lord, and that his reasoning is natural, not spiritual, he will be unable to pray until he submits to the breaking that comes from his acknowledgment of this sense. This breaking is a deeper and finer dealing.</p>
<p>As the Spirit&rsquo;s operation in him deepens, he will find it difficult to either criticize or praise people. In the early stages of being dealt with in this matter, a voice within will ask whether his criticism or praise is of himself or of the Lord and whether it is natural or spiritual. If he continues to deal with these inward matters, the Spirit will even begin to ask whether his prayer is of himself or of God and whether he is the one praying or whether God is praying. At this stage the Spirit&rsquo;s dealing is rather deep and severe.</p>
<p>Initially, the Spirit will touch our sins, temper, mistakes, and criticism of others. After dealing with these things, the Spirit will touch us in a deeper way. He will touch our good attributes, our good ideas, and our praise of others. At this stage our inner sense will not be related to whether our actions are right and our words are good but whether our actions and words are of Christ. Our actions may be right, and our words may be good, but they may only be of our natural self. Hence, the Spirit will show that even these things must be dealt with and rejected. If we deal with these matters, the Spirit will touch our prayer, which is deeper. He will ask whether He is the one praying in us or whether we are praying in ourselves. This experience indicates that the self must be terminated in both sinful matters and in our prayer. A Christian should abstain from sinning and also refrain from doing proper things by the self. To be a Christian is to put aside one&rsquo;s self in everything, whether in doing good or in doing evil, and to live by Christ completely, allowing Him to live in us and live out of us.</p>
<p>The Spirit will continue to touch us until everything that issues out of us, including our sins, temper, flesh, naturalness, and self, is terminated. The more we are touched by the Lord, the more we will be dealt with. The more dealings we have, the more we will advance. Then our inner eyes will see the cross in a deeper way. Initially, our view of the cross is limited. This is not because the cross is small but because our view is limited. Every touch of the Spirit increases our view; that is, the more the Spirit touches us, the more we see. As we are continually touched, our view is gradually enlarged until our inner eyes are fully opened. As a result, we will be like the apostle Paul, and we will be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, now I see that everything has been terminated!&rdquo; We will even ask ourselves why we exerted so much effort and why we had to pass through such a complicated process in order to see that everything was terminated on the cross. In this process we begin with a limited amount of light concerning the cross, and we are dealt with step by step until the light that we receive concerning the cross is full and complete. This is the experience of most believers in knowing and experiencing the cross. This way of knowing and experiencing the cross is good, but it is not the best.</p><h2 class="head1">COMPARING THE WAYS OF KNOWING AND<br />
EXPERIENCING THE CROSS</h2>
<p>There are two ways to know and experience the cross. One way begins with seeing a great light, which is followed by step-by-step dealings. The other way begins with step-by-step dealings that culminate in a great light. One way begins with a great light and proceeds step by step with small dealings. The other way begins with small dealings and continues step by step toward a great light. The first way is superior to the second way. Paul and a few other believers followed the first way, but the majority of believers follow the second way.</p>
<p>Immediately after his conversion Paul saw that all things had been terminated in the death of the cross and that he himself had also been terminated. When he subsequently encountered his flesh, his temper, the world, and the things of the world, these items were under his feet. They were under his feet according to what he had seen. The vision that he saw was complete, but his experience was gradual. He first saw the complete vision, and then he experienced its application step by step.</p>
<p>Most of us, however, did not begin as Paul did. We did not begin by seeing that the cross had dealt with everything and terminated all things. Rather, we saw that the death of the cross dealt with our sins. This is all that we saw. According to our view, the cross was small. This does not mean that the cross is small; rather, it means that our seeing of the cross at the time of our salvation was limited. Nevertheless, the Lord gradually gained ground in us and showed us that we need to deal with certain things and drop certain matters. After a while the Lord showed us that our flesh, our temper, and our self need to be dealt with and that our disposition and naturalness need to be broken. As time goes on, the Lord will show us that even our prayers and spiritual activities need to be dealt with. These breakings and dealings are experiences of the cross. The more we are broken and dealt with, the greater our vision of the cross will be. This will bring us into deeper experiences of the cross. Our knowledge and experience of the cross complement each other as cause and effect and will progress in cycles. These cycles continue until our flesh, temper, naturalness, self, and everything that belongs to the old creation are broken, dealt with, and terminated by the Lord step by step. Eventually, we will see that everything of the flesh, the world, and the old creation has been dealt with and terminated on the cross. When the Lord shines us upon with this great light, a light like Paul saw when he met the Lord, we will regret having spent so many years in being dealt with by the Spirit.</p>
<p>When the Spirit has to deal with matters such as movies, clothing, temper, and disposition only gradually, it seems as if the Spirit is cutting down the &ldquo;trees&rdquo; in us with a small knife. He spends a long time to cut down one tree and then even more time to cut down another tree. However, such a slow work in us is not the only way. The light that He gives can be so intense that everything of the self will be terminated instantly. If we experience the Spirit&rsquo;s shining with its exploding power, everything related to Satan and the old creation, including sin, the world, the flesh, and the self will collapse. This way of knowing and experiencing the cross is not only superior; it is normal. This was Paul&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the believers do not know and experience the cross in this way. The Lord may need two weeks to cut down a tree in some believers, and this would be considered quite fast. Other believers may not let Him cut down a tree even after a year. A brother may allow Him to cut only a branch, and after the branch has been cut, he will give a testimony in the meeting, and the other saints will praise and thank the Lord, thinking that he has received light. However, the truth is that four other branches have grown during this time! The saints do not have much growth in life, because the Lord can cut only one branch at a time and one tree at a time. Although this is right, it is slow. We must ask God to grant us much light, light with exploding power, so that we may know and experience the cross in a definite and quick way.</p>
<p>Christians follow one of these two ways of knowing and experiencing the cross. Even though these ways differ in their sequence, the pathway is actually the same. One begins from the larger end, and the other begins from the smaller end. The one that begins from the larger end is normal, solid, and quick. The one that begins from the smaller end is correct, but it is weak and slow. The saints who know and experience the cross in the second way think that the second way is solid and practical. They even teach others to know and experience the cross in this way. They encourage others to pray and wait for the Spirit to touch their problems and then to deal with what the Spirit touches. This way of knowing and experiencing the cross may be practical, but it is too slow.</p>
<p>Since the Lord&rsquo;s light enables us to know and experience the cross in a definite and quick way, why would we not seek the shining of this light? I do not deny or negate the gradual way of knowing and experiencing the cross. This way has its place. Those who know and experience the cross gradually obey the feeling that the anointing gives them. If the Spirit gives them a sense concerning movies, they deal with movies, and if He gives them a sense concerning clothing, they deal with clothing. Whatever He touches in their inner being is what they deal with. If the brothers and sisters among us practice this, they are doing something commendable, and they will advance. If there are brothers and sisters doing this in a certain locality, that church will be beautiful, because these saints are living in fellowship with the Lord, experiencing the moving of the Spirit, and dealing with matters one by one according to the teaching of the anointing. This is precious. However, this way is slow. There is another way, a faster way, in which we receive the shining of intense light that subdues everything instantly. We should treasure and seek this way.</p>
<p>May the Lord in His mercy show us that if we begin from the smaller end, we will have to deal with matters one by one before we see the great light, but if we begin from the larger end, we will see a great light and many things will be terminated by the shining of the light. Some portions of the Scriptures refer to the seeing that begins at the larger end, and some portions refer to the dealings that begin at the smaller end. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ.&rdquo; This refers to the seeing at the larger end. Romans 8:13 tells us to &ldquo;put to death the practices of the body.&rdquo; This refers to the dealing at the smaller end. These two verses seem to speak of two different experiences of the cross, but they are on the same pathway of knowing and experiencing the cross. Our vision should be great and complete, and our dealings should be small and gradual. The pathway that begins with a great and complete vision is solid and fast, and the pathway that begins with small, step-by-step dealings is weaker and slower.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PROPER ATTITUDE AND ASPIRATION</h2>
<p>We should walk on the pathway of knowing and experiencing the cross, but we should begin from the larger end. We should experience the cross gradually, but we should begin with a full knowledge of the cross. We should not be content with what we know or have experienced, nor should we be satisfied with beginning from the smaller end. Rather, we should aspire and seek after the better beginning, that is, to see the great and complete light of the cross and then let this light lead us on the way of the cross.</p>
<p>We may feel that we have seen the great light of the cross, but we should not be too confident or satisfied, because our feeling may not be accurate, and what we have seen may not be complete or solid. Hence, we need to seek with a humble heart and a deep aspiration. Our knowledge and experience of the cross can never be too deep or too solid. Even if we have some amount of knowledge and experience of the cross, there is much more for us to know and experience. We need to be humble, and we also need the Lord to create a deeper hunger and a more pressing desire in us.</p>
<p>We should not be satisfied with the gradual knowledge and experience of the cross, nor should we despise it. The accumulation of gradual knowledge and experience will lead us to see the great light. If we are faithful in every step of knowing and experiencing the cross, the light that we see will increase. Many people know and experience the cross according to the gradual way. They begin with limited knowledge and experience but continue step by step to a fuller knowledge and experience of the cross. Even fragments of knowledge and experience are precious. However, we must beware of being content with our knowledge and experience of the cross, because this contentment will hinder us from seeing greater light.</p>
<p>Those who follow the second way of knowing and experiencing the cross should not be self-satisfied or content. They should realize that there is more to know and experience of the cross. Furthermore, those who follow the first way of knowing and experiencing the cross should not despise the saints in the second way. The second way still comes from the Lord through the Spirit, and those in this way will eventually see a great and solid light.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s knowledge and experience of the cross can even reflect both ways. For example, some believers seem to begin in the second way, but their knowledge and experience quickly change in their intensity, becoming like the first way. Both ways require spiritual revelation and sight. Our knowledge of the cross depends on the revelation that we have received, and our experience of the cross equally depends on how much we have seen. We must seek revelation and pursue vision. If we have revelation and vision, we need to be faithful to pay the price to obey. Whatever the Spirit touches needs to be condemned, and we must deal with it. We should forsake whatever needs to be forsaken. If we are not willing to obey, we will have very little genuine knowledge and experience of the cross. May the Lord be merciful to us!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FACT AND THE EXPERIENCE<br />
OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 6:6, 11; 8:13; Col. 3:5; Gal. 5:24</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FACT OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The Scriptures reveal that the cross of Christ is an accomplished fact (Rom. 6:6). On the negative side, the cross of Christ terminated everything opposing God and resolved all the problems between God and man (John 12:31; Col. 2:15; Heb. 2:14); on the positive side, the cross of Christ released God&rsquo;s life and fulfilled God&rsquo;s plan (John 12:24, 32). Everything that offends God, opposes God, and frustrates God, including Satan, the demons, sin, the world, the flesh with its passions and its lusts, the old man, the self, and all things, has been dealt with and terminated by the cross. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s life and all its riches have been released through the cross. We do not need to be crucified again, because the flesh of sin, the old man, and the self have been crucified, and Christ also does not need to be crucified again, because God&rsquo;s life has been released. These are accomplished facts.</p>
<p>The cross of Christ is an accomplished fact. For example, we can see this accomplishment of these facts not only in relation to sin but also in relation to the old man. Romans 6:6 says, &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him.&rdquo; Christ dealt with our sins on the cross by dying on our behalf, and He also dealt with our sinful nature, the old man, by including us in His death on the cross. His vicarious death on our behalf dealt with our sins, and our co-crucifixion with Him dealt with our old man; both are accomplished facts. Just as our sins were removed through His vicarious death on the cross, our old man was terminated in our co-crucifixion with Him. His vicarious death dealt with our sins, and our co-crucifixion with Him dealt with our sinning person. His vicarious death and our co-crucifixion with Him are both accomplished facts related to His one death on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeing the Cross</h2>
<p>Since the cross is an accomplished fact, we do not need to do anything other than to see and know this fact. Although we do not need to be crucified again, we need to see and know the cross. Only Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion, not ours, can save us. A cross of our own cannot save us; only the cross of Christ can save us. Christ brought us to and included us in His death on the cross. In Christ we were crucified on the cross. Hence, we do not need to be &ldquo;nailed&rdquo; to the cross, because we have already been terminated there.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we need to see the cross. We need revelation to see and know the accomplished fact of the cross. We were put to death in Christ on the cross. In God&rsquo;s eyes this is a certain fact. However, without the revelation of the Scriptures and the shining of the Holy Spirit, we cannot truly know this matter. We can know and see the fact of the cross only through the enlightenment and revelation of the Holy Spirit through the Scriptures.</p>
<p>We do not have to crucify ourselves, and we cannot nail ourselves to the cross. Our crucifixion is a fact that has been accomplished for us by Christ. Nothing further is required of us other than seeing and knowing the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Accepting the Cross</h2>
<p>Once we see the fact of the cross, we will accept it. Once the Spirit shows us the fact of our co-crucifixion with Christ, He will lead us to accept it. If, under the enlightening of the Spirit, we see that our old man has been crucified with Christ, we will spontaneously acknowledge this matter and accept it as a reality. To accept is not merely to believe the truth of our co-crucifixion with Christ but to accept the fact of our co-crucifixion with Christ as a certainty and to acknowledge that we have already died. Romans 6:11 refers to this, saying, &ldquo;So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin...in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reckon ourselves to be dead not merely based on a doctrine of our co-crucifixion with Christ. Rather, we spontaneously acknowledge that we are dead when we see the fact of our co-crucifixion with Christ. Acknowledging the fact that we are dead is a spontaneous reckoning that is the result of seeing our co-crucifixion on the cross. There is no need to make an effort to remember to reckon. Anyone who needs to make an effort to remember to reckon himself dead lacks a genuine seeing of the cross. If, by the enlightenment and revelation of the Spirit, we see the fact of the cross, we will spontaneously acknowledge that we are dead. When the Spirit shines the fact of the cross into us and reveals it in us, the death of the cross immediately becomes a reality in us, and we spontaneously acknowledge that we are dead.</p><h2 class="head2">Applying the Cross</h2>
<p>After we have seen and accepted the cross, we will apply the cross. When the Spirit leads us to see and accept the fact of our co-crucifixion, He will further lead us to apply the death of the cross to ourselves in our experience. On the one hand, this is the Spirit&rsquo;s applying the death of the cross on our life, on us; on the other hand, it is our applying the death of the cross on ourselves. Romans 8:13 refers to this experience, saying, &ldquo;If by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body.&rdquo; Colossians 3:5 similarly says, &ldquo;Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although we do not have to and even cannot nail ourselves to the cross, we need to apply the death of the cross to ourselves by the Spirit, putting to death the practices of the body and of our sinning members on the earth. It is not possible to put to death the practices of our body without seeing the cross. Although we do not need to nail ourselves to the cross, we must apply the cross to ourselves. We can do this only by the Spirit and only after we see and accept the cross.</p>
<p>To apply the cross to ourselves is to crucify &ldquo;the flesh with its passions and its lusts,&rdquo; as spoken of in Galatians 5:24. It is easy to think that Galatians 5:24 and Romans 6:6 are speaking of the same thing, that is, the fact of the cross. Galatians 5:24, however, does not speak of the fact of the cross; it speaks of the application of the cross. Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ. This crucifixion is not something that we have done; it is something that Christ has done. Our old man was crucified when Christ was crucified. This is a fact accomplished by Christ. Galatians 5:24, however, says that we have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts. This is something that we do by the Spirit to crucify our flesh with its passions and its lusts. By the Spirit we need to apply the cross to our flesh and to our fleshly passions and lusts, putting them to death. This is the experience of applying the cross by the Spirit.</p>
<p>Romans 6 speaks of the fact that we obtained in Christ; Galatians 5 speaks of the experience that we apply by the Spirit. Romans 6 speaks of our old man having been crucified with Christ; Galatians 5 speaks of our crucifying the flesh with its passions and its lusts. The old man and the flesh are one, just as Christ and the Spirit are one. Christ is lived out and manifested by the Spirit; similarly, the old man, Adam, is lived out and manifested by the flesh. Everything in Christ is a fact, and everything in the Spirit is an experience. Similarly, everything in the old man, in Adam, is a fact, and everything in the flesh is an experience.</p>
<p>Romans 6:6 speaks of our old man having been crucified; this refers to the fact of crucifixion. Galatians 5:24 speaks of our crucifying the flesh; this refers to the experience of crucifixion. Our old man was crucified on the cross with Christ; this is the fact of crucifixion, which Christ accomplished for us. We crucify our flesh by the Spirit; this is the experience of crucifixion. The Bible does not say that our flesh has been crucified with Christ, nor does it speak of our crucifying the old man. Christ brought the old man in Adam to the cross, and it was crucified with Him. The flesh in our living, our walk, however, is crucified by the Spirit. The crucifying spoken of in Galatians 5:24 does not refer to our flesh being crucified with Christ on the cross as being a fact; it refers to our crucifying our flesh with its passions and its lusts by the Spirit&rsquo;s application of the cross. This relates not to a fact obtained in Christ but to an experience applied by the Spirit. Romans 6 says that our old man has been crucified. This is passive because it is something that Christ has done; hence, it is a fact. Galatians 5 says that we have crucified the flesh. This is active because it is something that we do by the Spirit; hence, it is an experience. Some believers have experience of this, and others do not. Nevertheless, according to God, all those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.</p>
<p>We crucify the flesh by the Spirit. Although we cannot crucify our old man, we can crucify our flesh. When we apply Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion of our old man to our flesh by the Spirit, we put to death our flesh by the Spirit. This applies the fact that Christ accomplished regarding the crucifixion of our old man to our flesh so that we can experience the cross today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE CROSS</h2>
<p>After we see, accept, and apply the fact of the cross, it becomes our experience. Facts are objective, and experiences are subjective. What Christ has accomplished for us is fact, but what the Spirit is leading us into is experience. We need to see the fact, but we also need the experience of accepting what we have seen and applying it to ourselves. Seeing the fact is instant; applying the fact in experience is constant. We enter into the experience of the cross by seeing the fact of the cross; we maintain the experience of the cross by applying the fact of the cross. Seeing the fact of the cross and entering into the experience of the cross are matters through the Spirit and by the Spirit. Similarly, applying the fact of the cross and maintaining the experience of the cross are matters through the Spirit and by the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Live in the Spirit</h2>
<p>We must live in our spirit. Only the Spirit can reveal the truth of our co-crucifixion with Christ in our spirit so that we see it as a fact. Furthermore, only the Spirit can turn the objective fact of our co-crucifixion with Christ into our subjective experience. This cannot be accomplished through doctrine. When we live in the Spirit and walk according to the Spirit, the Spirit spontaneously shows us the fact of the cross so that we may have the experience of the cross. To see and experience the cross, we must be in the Spirit and live in fellowship with the Lord through the Spirit. We will experience the fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ only when we put to death our flesh by the Spirit. Our being in Christ Jesus is a fact that becomes our experience when we are in the spirit (Rom. 6:11; 8:9).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEARING THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 10:37-39; 16:23-25; Mark 8:34-35; Luke 9:23-24; 14:26-27; 2 Cor. 4:10; Rom. 8:13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BEARING THE CROSS</h2>
<p>Many Christians have the inaccurate concept that bearing the cross means to suffer or endure hardships. According to the revelation of the Bible, the emphasis on bearing the cross is not related to suffering or enduring hardships but to accepting death, that is, being put to death. The purpose of the cross is not suffering but death. The cross puts a person in the place of death, not in a place of suffering. The cross is not a suffering penalty; it is a death penalty. To hang on the cross is surely a suffering; nevertheless, the purpose of hanging on the cross is not suffering but death. Therefore, bearing the cross is not about accepting and enduring suffering but about accepting death. To bear the cross is to enter into death, to be dealt with by death, so that we stop our function and activity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CRUCIFIED AND BEARING THE CROSS</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was the first person to bear the cross. On the way to being crucified at Golgotha the Lord bore a physical, visible cross (John 19:17), but He also bore an intangible, invisible cross during His entire life on earth. He put Himself under the death of the cross so that He could obey God&rsquo;s will, speak what God wanted Him to speak, and do what God wanted Him to do. The Lord&rsquo;s entire life on the earth was a living under the death of the cross. He did not seek His own will or do anything by Himself. He sought God&rsquo;s will, and He spoke and did things according to God (5:19, 30).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He never left the position of death; He never abandoned the cross. He remained under the death of the cross, lived a life of the cross, and walked the way of the cross until He was nailed to the cross at Golgotha. His acceptance of the cross did not begin at Golgotha, because He bore an invisible cross within Himself throughout His entire life. Ultimately, He bore a physical, visible cross outwardly and was crucified at the end of His life.</p>
<p>Crucifixion was the Lord Jesus&rsquo; obedience to the will of God (Matt. 26:39, 42, 44); thus, we have no part in it. During the first three hours of His crucifixion, from 9:00 A.M. to 12:00 noon, He suffered man&rsquo;s persecution for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s will (Mark 15:25-33). During the last three hours of His crucifixion, from 12:00 noon to 3:00 P.M. (Matt. 27:45), He suffered God&rsquo;s righteous judgment in His bearing of our sins. The Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours. We have no part in His suffering of God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on the cross. However, when He died on the cross, He was not alone, for we died with Him (Gal. 2:20). We were included in His death. When He was crucified, we were crucified with Him (Rom. 6:6).</p>
<p>We do not share in the aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion related to His persecution by man, nor do we share in the aspect of His crucifixion related to His being judged by God for our sins. Our experience of the crucifixion of Christ is limited to the termination of all things. The Lord Jesus was killed by men for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s will, and He suffered God&rsquo;s punishment because He bore our sins. Only the Lord Jesus was qualified to accomplish God&rsquo;s will and to bear our sins. Hence, we have no part in His crucifixion to accomplish God&rsquo;s will or in His being judged by God for our sins. However, we are included in the termination of all things, which was accomplished through His crucifixion. The Lord brought us with Him to the cross, and He included us in His death. We did not bear the cross with Him, but we were crucified together with Him. We have no part in His experience of bearing the cross, but we fully participated in His crucifixion. Hence, we were crucified with Him when He was crucified.</p>
<p>Through our union with Christ by faith, we were crucified with Him. When a person is saved, he should believe and accept his co-crucifixion with Christ, and thereafter he should live under the death of this co-crucifixion by willingly and joyfully allowing this death to be applied to him by the Spirit. Then instead of living by himself, he will live by God to obey the will of God. This is the spiritual reality of bearing the cross.</p>
<p>Unlike the Lord, who was crucified after bearing the cross, our crucifixion occurred before we were called to bear the cross. The Lord put Himself under the death of the cross before He was crucified, but we can put ourselves under the death of the cross because we have been crucified with the Lord. The Lord bore the cross before He was crucified, but we need to be crucified before we can bear the cross. Our bearing the cross is based on our being crucified. By the Spirit we can put ourselves under the death of the cross because we have been crucified with Christ. Our being under the killing of the cross is based on our co-crucifixion with Christ. Even though our co-crucifixion with Christ on the cross was accomplished by Christ, we need to put ourselves under the death of the cross by the Spirit. Our crucifixion is a fact already accomplished by Christ, but our bearing the cross is an experience that we continually carry out.</p>
<p>Our crucifixion is an accomplished fact that requires nothing from us other than seeing, believing, and accepting. Bearing the cross, however, is a personal experience. We are responsible for bearing the cross by the Spirit. We cannot and we need not crucify ourselves, but we can and we must bear the cross ourselves. We cannot crucify ourselves, but we can put ourselves under the death of the cross. Crucifixion was accomplished by the Lord on our behalf, and it requires no effort on our part. However, bearing the cross is our responsibility; it is something that we must carry out. Our bearing the cross is based on the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion. Without the fact of the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion for us, we could have no experience of bearing the cross. Crucifixion is the basis for bearing the cross, and bearing the cross is the issue of crucifixion. We see, believe, and accept the crucifixion, but we practice bearing the cross.</p>
<p>Seeing the crucifixion is a matter of faith, but bearing the cross is an act of faith. With our faith in the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion, we should bear the cross based on and by this faith. We receive the fact of crucifixion by faith, and we experience the bearing of the cross by this same faith. Although we did not personally experience the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion but instead accepted it by faith, we experience the bearing of the cross and carry it out by an act of faith. Bearing the cross is a personal experience that we carry out; thus, the cross that we bear is our cross. When we apply the Lord&rsquo;s cross to ourselves, making it our personal experience, this cross becomes our cross.</p>
<p>There is only one cross that saves&mdash;the cross of the Lord. We do not need to be nailed to this cross; we need only to bear it. We need only to accept the work that the Lord accomplished in His crucifixion, apply it to ourselves, and bear it. Our co-crucifixion was accomplished by the Lord once and for all, and we need only to accept it once, but bearing the cross is constant and continual. Although we need only to accept the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion once, we must continually bear the cross. Crucifixion requires one acceptance, but bearing the cross requires continual application. The Lord wants us to bear the cross daily in order to follow Him (Luke 9:23). We must continually put ourselves under the death of the cross by willingly accepting death and gladly bearing the cross so that we may be delivered from ourselves, live by God, and obey the will of God.</p><h2 class="head1">BEARING THE CROSS AND<br />
ENDURING SUFFERINGS AND DIFFICULTIES</h2>
<p>Although we are continually bearing the cross, we bear only one cross, not many crosses. This unique cross was accomplished by the Lord and is applied by us to become our cross. Contrary to what is commonly believed, this cross does not refer to many sufferings and difficulties. Many Christians consider sufferings and difficulties as &ldquo;crosses&rdquo; to be accepted and borne. In their understanding, to endure sufferings and difficulties is to bear the cross. Such an understanding is inaccurate. Although sufferings and difficulties can help us accept the cross, they are not &ldquo;crosses.&rdquo; God uses sufferings and difficulties to help us experience the cross, but He does not want us to consider sufferings and difficulties as &ldquo;crosses.&rdquo; Sufferings and difficulties are simply tools used by God to help us accept and experience the cross.</p>
<p>The cross is the Lord&rsquo;s death. When we bear the cross, we are applying the Lord&rsquo;s death to ourselves, putting ourselves under this death. When we do not apply or are unwilling to apply the Lord&rsquo;s death to ourselves, our sufferings and difficulties force us to experience the Lord&rsquo;s death. After we have accepted the Lord&rsquo;s death, His cross and our outward sufferings and difficulties often work together so that we experience the Lord&rsquo;s death. Thus, sufferings and difficulties are not the Lord&rsquo;s death or the cross. No matter how great they may be, these blows, adversities, sorrows, and losses are not &ldquo;crosses.&rdquo; The Bible never says that sufferings and difficulties are &ldquo;crosses.&rdquo; This inaccurate and unscriptural view is a natural concept; it has no scriptural basis. I hope that we will no longer see the cross in such a way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE CROSS AND<br />
BEING CONFORMED TO THE LORD&rsquo;S DEATH</h2>
<p>Bearing the cross means that we accept the Lord&rsquo;s death by faith and thus apply His death to ourselves. When we bear the cross in such a way, we put ourselves into the Lord&rsquo;s death and live in His death. This is to be conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death (Phil. 3:10). To be conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death is to live in His death. Being conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death is the same as bearing the cross. Bearing the cross is to live in the Lord&rsquo;s death and to follow the Lord in the way of the cross. Just as the Lord remained under the death of the cross, denied Himself, and lived by God, we also need to remain in the Lord&rsquo;s death, deny ourselves, and live by God. Just as the Lord chose the cross and lived under the death of the cross to establish the form of His death, we should bear the cross and live in the death of the cross to be conformed to the form of His death. To bear the cross is to be conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE CROSS AND<br />
BEARING ABOUT IN THE BODY THE DEATH OF JESUS</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:10 says, &ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus.&rdquo; The phrase <em>putting to death</em> can also be translated as &ldquo;killing.&rdquo; In other words, in our bodies the death of the Lord Jesus is always doing a killing work, killing everything in us that does not match God or that hinders, frustrates, nullifies, or prevents the life of God from operating in us. This is also bearing the cross, putting ourselves into the form of the Lord&rsquo;s death, allowing the Lord&rsquo;s death to put us to death. If we truly put ourselves into the form of the Lord&rsquo;s death and allow His death to put us to death, there will always be an operation of death in our bodies. In other words, if we truly bear the cross, we will bear about in our bodies the putting to death of Jesus, which is the killing of the cross. Hence, bearing the cross is to bear the death of the Lord Jesus in the body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE CROSS AND<br />
BEING PUT TO DEATH BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit (Rom. 8:13), because we have seen, believed, and accepted the fact that we died with Christ. We apply our co-crucifixion to the flesh by the Spirit so that He can do the putting-to-death work in us. We bear the cross because we have seen, believed, and accepted the fact of the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion, and we apply the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion to ourselves by the Spirit so that the Spirit can put us to death. In principle, bearing the cross and applying the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion are the same. However, the putting to death by the Spirit is related to the practices of the body and of our sinning members, that is, the flesh and our sinful deeds; bearing the cross, however, is related to dealing with our soul-life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EMPHASIS OF BEARING THE CROSS<br />
BEING TO DEAL WITH THE SOUL-LIFE</h2>
<p>The Epistles do not refer directly to bearing the cross. However, every time that the Lord Jesus spoke concerning bearing the cross, He also spoke concerning our soul-life. Bearing the cross is related to the soul-life, because bearing the cross deals with the soul-life (Matt. 10:37-39; 16:23-25; Mark 8:34-35; Luke 9:23-24; 14:26-27; John 12:24-26). The Lord&rsquo;s intention in asking us to bear the cross is that we would deal with our soul-life, putting our soul-life under the death of the cross and allowing the cross to put our soul-life to death.</p>
<p>The soul-life is our natural life and is the biggest hindrance to our spiritual growth in the divine life. In other words, our soul-life hinders the growth of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life in us, which is our inner man, and it also keeps us from following the Lord and obeying the will of God. Therefore, if we want our spiritual life to grow and if we want to freely follow the Lord and obey the will of God, we must bear the cross by allowing the cross to put our soul-life to death.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke of bearing the cross and of dealing with the soul-life, not merely because it is crucial to deal with the soul-life but because every aspect of the soul-life needs to be dealt with. In Matthew 10:37-39 and in Luke 14:26 the Lord said that the natural emotion of the soul-life needs to be dealt with. Matthew 16:22-24 shows that the natural opinions and views of the soul-life need to be dealt with. Luke 17:31-33 and John 12:24-26 speak of not preserving or loving our soul-life so that we can follow the Lord and live for God and to God by the life of the Lord.</p></body></html>
