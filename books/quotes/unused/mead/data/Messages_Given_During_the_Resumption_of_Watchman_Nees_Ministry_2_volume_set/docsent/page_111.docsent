   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KESWICK CONVENTION AND OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition to him, there were others like Evan Hopkins of England and Theodore Monod of France.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These ones, together with Smith in America, formed the so-called Keswick movement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition, there was Andrew Murray, a Dutchman.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The raising up of these brothers set the general scene for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, their recoveries were not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There were still recoveries of other minor parts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, we have the recovery of the hymns by Frances Ridley Havergal, and some other contributions by other writers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE RECOVERY OF THE CRUCIFIXION OF THE OLD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the last century, God enlightened men concerning the matter of consecration and its importance through the brothers we have mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, their revelations were not deep enough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Consecration is not simply a kind of exchange, in which we offer to God all we have and all we are, and we take back from Him what He has and what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Darby told others that consecration is based on the casting off of the man of flesh and the removal of this man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The goal of the gospel is not only to forgive the sinner's sin, but to crucify the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The gospel saves not merely by forgiving the sinner and delivering him from perdition, but by crucifying the sinner with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In preaching the gospel, we have to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are not careful, we will easily preach the wrong thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The gospel removes not only the sin in the flesh, but the person of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What goes to the heavens is the new man, and not the fleshly man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All spiritual lessons, including obedience and our service to the Lord, must be practiced in accordance with this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even lessons as spiritual as those taught by Madame Guyon must be pursued according to the principle mentioned here by Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 7 says that we are dead to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why we can be married to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only are our sins dead, but we ourselves are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we were not dead, it would be unlawful and adulterous for us to be joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are dead, we would not be our own person any longer, because the cross has removed our own person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today there is no longer any need for this person to ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only a living person needs forgiveness; a dead person does not need forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The one who was dead in sin is the crucified old man, and the cross has removed this old man already.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was what Darby preached.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE RECOVERY OF THE TRUTH OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After this, we have Mrs. Penn-Lewis, who was raised up to preach the truth concerning the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She preached about the cross dealing with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Her understanding was more advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Notwithstanding, today our understanding of the subject is more clear than that of Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE RECOVERY OF THE TRUTH OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After Mrs. Penn-Lewis, we have Mr. T. Austin-Sparks, who saw resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have been talking about resurrection for years, but we do not know what resurrection really is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis wrote two books about resurrection, but they are not very clear about the subject either.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was not until Brother T. Austin-Sparks wrote about resurrection in 1926 and published what he wrote in the Overcomer magazine that the world knew for the first time what resurrection is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Miss Barber and I read his writings, we began to pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people talk about resurrection, but they have not presented to others resurrection the real thing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Brother Sparks talked about resurrection, light came.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He presented to others the very resurrection itself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is life going into death and passing through death; in the process, what succumbs to death dies, and what cannot die comes out of death alive.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This coming out of death is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Resurrection is anything that death cannot swallow up.</S>
