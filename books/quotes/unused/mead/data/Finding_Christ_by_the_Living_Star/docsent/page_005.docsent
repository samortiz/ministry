   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NICODEMUS AND THE PHARISEES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John chapter 7 there is another case of finding Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ was doing some marvelous things, and the people were saying, "Of a truth this is the prophet."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Others said, "This is the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then some said, "Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hath not the Scripture said, that Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yes, the Scripture does say that; they were one hundred percent right.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But they missed the mark just by being right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they did not know the Bible so well, I believe it would be easy for them to grasp the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They were frustrated by their Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yes, He was born in Bethlehem, but He was raised in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This really bothers people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you only hold the Bible in your hand, you will miss Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You must follow the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then Nicodemus, who had come to know Christ somewhat, began to argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But they protested, "Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet!"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were absolutely right; not even the least prophet came out of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not say, "Search and look," but, "Come and see!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you search and look, you will miss the mark, you will miss Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ was right there; yet they said, "Search and look."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>So many Christians are missing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They keep themselves to the Scriptures: they say, "Have not the Scriptures said?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But they miss Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here is the Bible, and here is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They care for the Bible, but they would not care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Oh, it is possible to be so right, but wrongly right!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may be right, but you are just partly right; eventually you are not right, for you have missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord always acts in a "sneaky" way to those who feel they are so right.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He does it purposely; He does not want us just to know the knowledge and go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He wants us to be alert at all times lest by knowing the Bible we lose His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Oh, it is possible to lose the presence of the Lord just by knowing the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I would rather lose the knowledge of the Bible and keep the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not say that as long as you are scriptural, you are all right.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regardless of how scriptural you are, if you lose the presence of the Lord, you are absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Knowledge alone does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It did not work with the scribes, the chief priests, and the Pharisees, and it will not work for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is the New Testament way to find and follow the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is continually to keep His presence, His hidden presence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He prophesied that he would come out of Bethlehem, but He came out of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Give up your searching.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God can never be understood by searching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am not searching; I am seeing, I am enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not understand and I do not care to understand, but I enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His presence is really hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Isaiah 45:15 tells us that He is a hidden God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is a God that hides Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Learn to praise Him, learn to see Him, learn to trace Him, learn to find Him, but never try to understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not qualified to understand Him; we are only qualified to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So "come and see."</S>
