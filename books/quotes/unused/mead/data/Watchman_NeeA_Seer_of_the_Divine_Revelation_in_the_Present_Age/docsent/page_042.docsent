   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT A WONDER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>About four years ago, I went to an auction at the house of a German doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Upon inquiring I found that this doctor was the one who had taken x-rays of my chest many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He had taken three pictures and told me that there was no hope.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I asked him to take another picture, he said that there was no further need.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He then showed me another person's chest x-ray and said, "This person's condition was better than yours, yet he died at his home two weeks after this picture was taken.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Don't come to see me anymore; I don't want to make money out of you."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I heard this, I went home extremely disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then, four years ago, I read an advertisement in the newspaper concerning the auction of a building and furniture of a certain famous German doctor who had died.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I discovered that this doctor was the one who had taken x-rays of my chest many years ago, I lifted up my hands to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I said, "This doctor has died.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He said that I would die soon, but now he is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord has shown me His grace."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Under the Lord's blood, I said, "This doctor, who was stronger than I, has died, but I have been healed by the Lord and am still alive."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On that day I bought many things from his house for memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>GOD'S FURTHER SUSTAINING CARE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While Brother Nee was seriously sick with tuberculosis, his heart was stricken with angina pectoris in 1927.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God graciously healed him of tuberculosis, but sovereignly left him with the angina pectoris.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He suffered this heart disease for forty-five years, until the end of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It often caused him to suffer severe pain and experience cold sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes, while delivering a message, the pain would hit, and he would be forced to lean upon the stand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He could have died at any moment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This spontaneously ushered him into a full trust in the Lord for his existence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moment by moment he existed by faith in God, and all through the years God sustained him with His gracious care and resurrection life until he died.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through such physical hardship, he experienced and enjoyed God much more than would have been possible if he had not had such an entangling and exhausting disease.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The kind of divine healing Watchman Nee experienced is different from the so-called gift of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was not merely a miraculous act of God; it was the working out of the resurrection life through the procedure of grace by the exercise of living faith in the faithful Word of God for edification and growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was not merely a miracle of divine power; it was absolutely a matter of grace and of the divine life.</S>
