   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTY THE SPIRIT GOD'S ULTIMATE EXPRESSION Scripture Reading: Zech 3:9; 4:2, 6, 10a; Rev 1:4, 20b; 4:5b; 5:6; 22:17a SEVEN GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last book of the Bible opens with a vision of seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we are told, the lampstands are seven churches Rev 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why is the church a golden lampstand?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Very few see this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we said in previous messages, the golden lampstand firstly symbolizes the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It speaks of His nature, form, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father is the nature, the Son is the image, and the Spirit is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For the church to be represented by this very same symbol indicates that the church is the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ultimately the church is one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From the standpoint of experience, how does the Triune God come into us and then become the church?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since our regeneration, we have had the nature of God, the pure gold, inside us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But for this gold to take the shape of the lampstand requires that we be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TRANSFORMED, NOT REFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am not talking about being reformed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Transformation is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It involves a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A mortician has to apply artificial coloring to the face of a dead person in order to disguise the pallor of the lips and the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The corpse lies in his coffin, still lifeless, but his appearance is much improved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The best reformation can do is to superficially change the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Transformation, in contrast, produces change from within.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you are sickly and pallid, you need to begin eating properly and getting enough fresh air and exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After a time the proper diet and exercise will cause a metabolic change in your appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without any false color being added to your skin, your complexion will be vibrant with good health.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Scripture speaks of being transformed in 2 Corinthians 3:18: "But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>. Romans 12:2 also tells us not to be "conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Transformation refers to a metabolic change brought about by another element being added to us and becoming part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without this additional element, which is God Himself, we cannot be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The best we can hope for is an improved appearance, while we still remain our old self.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has no interest in improving us outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His economy is first to regenerate us by adding His very nature to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This higher element then begins to uplift our original element and gradually eliminates the negative things of that original condition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Holy Spirit comes into man, He brings with Him the element of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This element effects a change in man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This change is usually called the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is not merely reforming man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As those who have studied chemistry know, there cannot be a chemical reaction without a new element being added, no matter how much effort is made to uplift the original constituents.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is pitiful that so many Christians regard the work of the Spirit as a work of reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They ask God for His Spirit to help them to be more loving and to fulfill their duties.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They consider themselves as poor and weak, in need of the power of the Holy Spirit to strengthen them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The thought of God as the all-powerful One, answering the prayers of poor, frail human beings by strengthening them to meet their obligations, is a natural religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a concept is not the revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Holy Spirit comes, He brings God into you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God Himself becomes the source within you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He becomes your life, bringing about a subjective, organic change.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is not helping you in an external way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The end result is that you become God-men, not good men!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are not merely full of virtues, but full of God!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You are not here to express virtues, but to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We were born men of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the Holy Spirit comes, He begins to change us into men of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He also shapes the gold within us until it is in the form of a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This lampstand is the church.</S>
