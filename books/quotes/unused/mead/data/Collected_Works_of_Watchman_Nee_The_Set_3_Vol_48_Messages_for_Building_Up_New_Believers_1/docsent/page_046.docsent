   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ANNULLING OF NATIONALITY A. There Being No Distinction</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Between Jews and Greeks</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the world the greatest distinction is based on nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Jews and the Greeks are two very distinctive races.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Jews are very nationalistic.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are the descendants of Abraham, the chosen people of God; they are the only nation established by God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are separated from other nations and are a peculiar people unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But instead of humbling themselves before God and exalting Him, they are proud and boast of themselves before other races.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their pride carries their nationalism to an extreme degree.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They despise all Gentile nations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In their eyes the Gentiles are animals, dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not recognize the Gentiles in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why it is rather difficult to put a Gentile next to a Jew and ask them to be fellow Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Jew may believe in the Lord Jesus and call himself a Christian, but it is very difficult to persuade him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The book of Acts tells us that the gospel was preached first to the Jews on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later, when the gospel reached Samaria, it was the Jews who were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to bring the gospel to the Gentiles, the Lord had to raise up Paul and charge him with the preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even then, it did not immediately begin in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Peter had to make a start in Caesarea first.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was quite hard for Peter as an apostle to the Jews to go to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, he needed to see a vision three times and had to hear the Lord say three times, "Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without this, Peter would never have dared go to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was the first time the gospel was preached to the Gentiles, and it shows how reluctant the Jews were to preach to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Acts 15 a problem arose in the matter of circumcision and the keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some advocated that the Gentile believers needed to be circumcised and keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were, in effect, saying that in order for a Gentile to be a Christian, he had to be a Jew first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How strong was this nationalistic barrier!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Gentiles had to wait until Acts 15 before they were exempted from circumcision and from keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter and the others told Paul and Barnabas to go freely to the Gentiles and assured them that they would all remain in the same fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Galatians 2 tells us that Peter went to Antioch and ate with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when certain people came from James, he shrank back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul openly rebuked Peter for not walking according to the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The cross had already broken down the middle wall of partition, and there should be neither Jews nor Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may be a Jew or a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But may the Lord bless us to see that in Christ we all have been made one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our nationality has been abolished and our national distinctions no longer exist.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether one is a Chinese believer, an English believer, an Indian believer, or a Japanese believer, he has become a brother or sister in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot separate God's children by nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot have Chinese Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If it is Chinese then it is no longer Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is either "Chinese-ity" or "Christian-ity"; there is no such thing as Chinese Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These two terms contradict one another.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are all brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There cannot be any national distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is quite obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Body of Christ, in the new man, we are fully one; there are no national distinctions of any kind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even nationalism as strong as that of the Jews has been annulled by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>B. The Cross Breaking Down</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>the Middle Wall of Partition</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ephesians tells us about a wall between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The two are separated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the cross has broken down the middle wall of partition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no longer any distinction or separation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we meet someone who is in Christ, we should not say that he is Chinese; he is a person in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not say that someone is an Englishman; we should say that he is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have all become one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Never think of having a Chinese church or a Chinese testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a great mistake, and the idea should not even cross our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Please remember that in Christ, there is no distinction between Greeks and Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a brother or a sister introduces such a thing among us, it means that he or she is bringing in a foreign element.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The result will be corruption within.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not have any distinction between Jews and Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Christ we are all joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to eradicate all nationalistic notions from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The moment we bring such a thing into the church, the church becomes an organization of the flesh and no longer the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some people are so strong in their nationalistic feelings that they cannot be Christians in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Though we are Chinese and under the jurisdiction of our country, this relationship ceases when we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whenever we come before the Lord, we do not come as a Chinese person.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Such a consciousness should be kept outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We hope new believers will see from the very beginning that we are linked together in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I have received the life of Christ, and a brother in England or a brother in India or Japan has also received the same life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are united according to the life of Christ, not according to our nationalities.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must have a very clear vision about this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the Body, in Christ, and in the new man, nationality does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That distinction has been totally abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After the First World War, a few brothers from England went to Germany for a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>During the conference, a brother stood up and introduced the British brothers with the words, "The war is over, and some English brothers are here to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We warmly welcome them."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After this introduction, a brother from England stood up and said, "We are not English brothers; we are brothers from England."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is a marvelous word.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There are no English brothers; there are only brothers from England.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>How can there be an English brother, an American brother, a French sister, or an Italian sister in the house of God?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Thank God, there are no national distinctions in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Brothers and sisters, we are all part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have received the laying on of hands already.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Now we must see that all distinctions between Greeks and Jews have been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There are no longer any such distinctions in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is a glorious fact, a truly glorious truth.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the church there is only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There is nothing besides Christ.</S>
