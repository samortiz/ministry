   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHOOSING FROM THREE DIFFERENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>KINDS OF OCCUPATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we see three different kinds of occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One is to trade, another is to work, and the third is to produce.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The highest occupation God has ordained in the Bible is the one that produces.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since Adam, God s eyes have been on occupations that produce, because production increases the abundance of the earth rather than imposing poverty on others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If I raise a hundred sheep and after a certain number of years they have become four hundred, I have increased by three hundred sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This increase does not decrease a single dollar from any brother s or sister s pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How much money you have at home will not change.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You will not have less just because my sheep has brought forth lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the basic scriptural principle of occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I should always be increasing and should always be adding to riches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I may sell my sheep and receive money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in so doing, I have not made anyone poorer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a new believer has the chance to choose his own occupation, I hope he will choose one that will increase goods rather than increase his money.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To increase money but not goods is very selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to learn to increase the things of the earth, not to increase our personal wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a great difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul s tentmaking shows us another principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not increase the amount of cotton, silk, or fabric.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But because of his cutting, sewing, effort, and energy, he increased the value of the raw material.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Bible scholars, tents at that time had to be dyed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Dean Alford told us that when Paul said, These hands, in Acts 20:34, he was referring to the unavoidable stain of the dye of the tents on his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul s tentmaking was something that increased the value of goods.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is good to increase the riches of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is also good to increase the value of goods.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose I make a chair from a piece of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is good, because by doing so, I have increased the value of the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although I have not increased the abundance in nature, the world has one more chair through me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The world had one more tent when Paul made a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This does not benefit oneself at the expense of others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One can make a tent; he can turn a cheap fabric into a valuable tent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Turning fabric into a tent increases the goods of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is also an occupation that is acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A new believer must see that there are two criteria to a proper occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One must either increase the abundance of the earth or increase the value of goods.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, when one makes a tent, he is also increasing the abundance of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because of the work of one s hands, the number of tents in this world has increased.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, it is also right to say that this increases the abundance of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the basic principle of God s ordained occupations for men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>AVOIDING PURE COMMERCE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have studied economics a little.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I know that there is the need for commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But I am a Christian; I am not an economist.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While the Lord Jesus did say that we needed to do business until He comes Luke 19:13 , that verse means that we should give ourselves to our work like a businessman giving himself to his business.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We know that a businessman has to devote himself to his business.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He will get into any situation as long as there is money in it for him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord meant that we should grasp every opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must give ourselves to our work in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Commerce began with Tyre, and it ends up in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We find this from Ezekiel 28 to Revelation 18.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The one who invented commerce is the prince of Tyre.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ezekiel 28 shows us that the prince of Tyre represents Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned v. 16 . Bear in mind that commerce always makes money for oneself at the expense of others and at the expense of decreasing the riches of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not the kind of occupation that God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the occupation which belongs to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The principle behind such an occupation is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The principle of commerce is to increase the money in one s pocket by decreasing the money in another s pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once the idea of making money comes into a person s mind, the result is very simple one will get more money while another will have less.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once someone s money increases, there must be others whose money decreases.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Suppose there are only twenty-one billion dollars in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whether you are rich or poor, the total amount of money remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The total amount of money in the world is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For my money to increase, I have to take it from others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is pure commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am not saying that after catching some fish, one cannot sell it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Neither am I saying that after harvesting a crop, producing a lamb, or making a tent, one cannot sell it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am saying that making tents, raising lambs, harvesting crops, and catching fish are not pure commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those occupations exchange production for money.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I derive my benefit from nature.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The abundance I receive comes from nature.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is nature that gives me the abundance; I do not become richer by making others poorer.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Christians must not try to make money from other people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Never harbor any thought of taking advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As God s children, we have a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It does not look good for us to try to rack up the lowly money of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Suppose the president of a foreign nation comes to Kuling and finds a local native infected with malaria.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Suppose he tries to sell him some quinine pills, saying, I bought them for five dollars per pill.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now I am selling them to you for six dollars per pill.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What kind of story would that be?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It does not match the status of a nation s president to earn a dollar from a coolie.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>For a Christian to earn someone else s money is even worse than a president taking money from a coolie.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our status is different.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We cannot make money from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Christians are noble people; we have our dignity, our standing, and our principles.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is a shame for us to make money from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We cannot increase our wealth this way.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I would rather be a farmer who tills and plants.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is more glorious than making money from others.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God has prepared nature to work for us, and we will be more noble if we do not try to make money from others.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Christians must have the thought that they will not earn money at the expense of other human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Any occupation that increases the quantity and value of goods is acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But pure commerce is not acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Please pay special attention to Ezekiel 28.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The principle of aggrandizement through trade began with the prince of Tyre.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God rebuked him, saying, By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In Revelation 18 the world has come to an end and the kingdom is about to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>There we see Babylon being judged.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Commerce continues throughout history until the end of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>All the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There we also see all the goods of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The first is gold and the last are the souls of men.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Everything is open for purchase and for sale, from gold to the souls of men.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Man always thinks of making money and becoming rich.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>But brothers and sisters, we must flee from this low occupation.</S>
