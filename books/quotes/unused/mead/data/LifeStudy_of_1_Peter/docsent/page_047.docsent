   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BASIS OF ALL SPIRITUAL GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Nourishing food will cause transformation only when it is given to something living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you try to give nourishment to something lifeless and inorganic, that thing would become corrupt and unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is impossible for something lifeless to receive help from nourishing food.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Obviously it is useless to try to feed a dead person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No doubt, the guileless milk in the word can feed us and nourish us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, it can only feed and nourish those who are living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without life, there would not be anything in us to cooperate with this nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Peter begins 2:2 with the words As newborn babes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word newborn indicates a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A newborn babe is living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As such newborn babes, we need to drink the guileless milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the milk will afford us living, organic nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Spontaneously the life within us will work together with the nourishment of the milk so that we may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, if we did not have a living, organic element in us through regeneration, the nourishment in the milk of the word would not have any effect, for there would not be any cooperation on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1:23 Peter says that we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 2:2 he urges us to be as newborn babes longing for milk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both regeneration in 1:23 and the newborn babes in 2:2 point to the same matter regeneration with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This regeneration is the base for our growth in life and for the purification of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all have within us the divine life that we received in regeneration as the basis of all spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to grow and be purified, we must have this base.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, as newborn babes, we should long for the guileless milk of the word so that by it we may grow unto transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>TASTING THAT THE LORD IS GOOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 3 Peter continues, If you have tasted that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord can be tasted, and His taste is pleasant and good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have tasted Him, we shall long for the nourishing milk in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Greek word rendered good in this verse also means pleasant, kind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter was certain that the ones to whom he was writing had been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But he was not sure that they had tasted the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason he says, If you have tasted that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was certain that the believers were newborn babes, but as verse 3 indicates, some of them may not have tasted that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today millions of believers have truly been regenerated, but a great many have never tasted that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us use an example to show how someone may be regenerated and yet not have tasted that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A middle-aged lady had been saved for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She had been redeemed and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After visiting our meetings a few times, one day she stood up to give a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She said that her husband had lost his job, and they were unable to pay the rent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, their son was sick.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She went on to say that she prayed to the Lord about the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She praised the Lord that He gave her husband a better job, provided a better place for them to live, and even healed their son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She declared, Hallelujah, the Lord Jesus is living and able!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us consider this testimony carefully and ask if it is the testimony of a person who has tasted the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I would say strongly that this is not the testimony of one who has tasted that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Years ago I would have felt differently about this, and I would have said that this woman surely has tasted that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, in her testimony she said, How good the Lord is to me!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is real, living, and good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We prayed, and He gave us a better job and a better house, and He healed our son.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But although she spoke of the Lord s goodness, this is not the testimony of tasting that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What, then, would be a genuine testimony of tasting the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose the same sister testified something like this: My husband has lost his job, we have lost our dwelling place, and our son is ill.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we pray, the more trouble we seem to have.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But, brothers and sisters, I can testify that the more difficult our situation is, the happier I am inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oh, how I enjoy the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have experienced a little of what Paul experienced when he asked the Lord to take away the thorn and the Lord refused, saying that His grace was sufficient for Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord caused Paul to enjoy His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He put him into a particular environment so that he would have to enjoy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He did not take away the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the one hand, Paul suffered the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But on the other hand, he was experiencing the Lord s sustaining grace.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In our case, it has been several months, and still the Lord has not done anything for us outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But I can testify that I have been enjoying Him as my grace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When my mother learned of our situation, she said, What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Where is your Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Is He real and living?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Why wouldn t He do anything for you?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You should go to Buddha instead.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But no matter what she says to me, I keep on enjoying the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a testimony of tasting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The tasting of the Lord is not in outward miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather, it is in the inward nourishment of life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>No matter what kind of environment we may be in or what kind of circumstances we may have, we are sustained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can say with Paul, I can do all things in Him who empowers me Phil 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can stand the test of both riches and poverty, of both pleasant circumstances and difficult, because we do not care for the outward situation but for the inward nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This inward nourishment is the genuine tasting of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In these verses Peter indicates that if we have tasted that the Lord is good, we shall surely long for the milk in the word.</S>
