<P>When they are caught up to the heavens, war breaks out. Verse 7 says that there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon and his angels. The presence of the overcomers as the man-child gives Michael the ground to execute the judgment upon Satan accomplished by the Lord on the cross. When we go somewhere, we should be those who give the ground to the Lord to execute His judgment for the furtherance of His economy to carry out His judgment upon Satan. Verses 8 and 9 say that Satan, the great dragon, the ancient serpent, the devil, the accuser of God's children, was cast down out of heaven due to the overcomers as the executors of God's economy.</P><P>Verse 11 says that they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life unto death. These are the principles of the overcomers in the man-child. This is the way they maintain their vitality.</P><P>Any time you stand up for God's eternal economy, the enemy Satan will rise up to accuse you. He wants to drain the spiritual energy in your being by accusations, whether they are founded or not, to put a hole in your conscience. But it is good to see that the overcomers have learned how to use the blood. This is not only the redeeming blood but also the blood that speaks better things for us (Heb. 12:24). We can apply the blood to maintain our vitality. As Satan is accusing us before the Lord, we can apply the blood. We overcome by the blood of Christ because that blood speaks for us and protects us from all Satan's false accusations against us before God.</P><P>The overcomers also have the word of their testimony. We have to learn how to testify according to what the Lord has accomplished. Specifically, we should testify that the devil has been judged by the Lord. When Satan accuses us, we need to testify. We should say, "Satan, you're a liar. You have been dealt with on the cross. Jesus is Lord!" In this way we maintain the vitality and strength in our spiritual being so we can continue to further God's economy.</P><P>Finally, the overcomers of the man-child love not their soul-life even unto death. Because of Adam's fall, Satan joined himself to man's soul-life, man's self (Matt. 16:23-24). Hence, to overcome Satan we must not love our soul-life. The overcomers have learned to hate and deny their soul-life (Luke 14:26; 9:23). We have to deny our soul-life even unto death. With such people God's economy has a way to be carried out. With them there is a way for God to execute judgment upon Satan. Those in the man-child overcome the enemy by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of their testimony, and by not loving their soul-life unto death.</P>
