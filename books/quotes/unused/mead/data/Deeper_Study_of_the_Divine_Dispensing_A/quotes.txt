[1]  Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us.
[2]  God is one, yet He has a distinction of three.
[3]  THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY The Triune God Becoming the Flesh, Dispensing Himself as Grace and Reality to Man
[4]  The Triune God Dispensing the Son as Eternal Life to His Believers
[5]  The Son as God's grace and reality is dispensed into all those who believe in Him.
[6]  In other words, as the eternal life, God's only begotten Son is dispensed to us John 3:16 .
[7]  John 12:24 shows us that the Lord Jesus as the divine grain of wheat containing the divine life and glory released the divine life through the breaking of the shell of His body in death to produce many grains to be formed into one loaf, which is the church, the Body of Christ, to be His increase, for the expression of His glory.
[8]  Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[9]  That gospel tells people that they have sinned and must suffer the punishment of hell, but that God has had pity on them and has given His beloved Son to die for them to redeem them and to resurrect for them, and that as long as they repent and believe in Him, they will receive eternal life and will go to heaven.
[10]  Third, to breathe in the name of the Lord Jesus is not only to breathe in the Lord as air, but to drink of the pneumatic Christ as the living water John 4:10, 14; 7:37-39 .
[11]  Hence, He is not only our life and our air, but also our living water.
[12]  SECTION II The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the Believers' Spirit, Soul, and Body and Its Results and Goal CHAPTER THREE THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD CONSUMMATED TO BECOME THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING The Spirit of life being the compound Spirit: Being a mingling of the divinity, humanity, human living, death, and resurrection of Christ with the Spirit of God to become the holy ointment Exo 30:23-25.
[13]  In Paul's Epistles, and especially in the book of Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Ephesians, we see that before the ages, that is, in eternity past, God had a desire and a pleasure.
[14]  He told us that with the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit the Father is in the Son, the Son has become the Spirit, who is the Spirit of life, and this Spirit of life has a law.
[15]  As far as God's creation is concerned, we are good.
[16]  THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE BEING THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD
[17]  Today, we the sinners need only to repent, believe in the Lord Jesus, and call on His name.
[18]  The all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit will enter into us to be our life, and there will be a wonderful change.
[19]  A SUPPLEMENTARY WORD 1 THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING
[20]  Today, the One that we believe in and worship is such a One.
[21]  He has become the Spirit, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, for the purpose that we would partake of His divine dispensing.
[22]  This is the mysterious economy of God, which is to dispense and to distribute to God's children all the rich elements of God.
[23]  The traditional concept in Christianity is that God wants us, the saved ones, to be good, to be spiritual, and to be holy, but there is no concept that God wants us to be God-men.
[24]  When God became flesh and came to earth, He was both God and man, a wonderful God-man, having both divinity and humanity.
[25]  As for us, we are not only created by Him, but we have Him begotten into us, so that every one of us has God's life and nature, and we are now God's children 2 Pet 1:4 .
[26]  But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[27]  Prayer: Lord, we praise and thank You that You are here with us.
[28]  We believe that You will speak to us in Your Spirit.
[29]  John revealed to us in his Gospel that the God whom we worship, serve, believe in, and live by is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[30]  Paul also revealed to us in his epistles that we who are created by God are tripartite men, composed of spirit, soul, and body.
[31]  The Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is mysterious and is not simple at all.
[32]  We all have to see that the Triune God is the greatest "electricity."
[33]  CHAPTER FIVE THE RESULTS OF THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY AS THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE IN THE BELIEVERS 1 OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING The believers being saved in the life of Christ that they may reign in this life Rom 5:10, 17b:
[34]  For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.
[35]  In the previous three messages we have seen that the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit has passed through all kinds of processes and has worked Himself into us, the tripartite beings with a spirit, a soul, and a body.
[36]  For Him to work Himself into us, the main thing is for Him to be our life.
[37]  We do not have much concept that we need God's life, that is, to have the life of God in addition to our original human life.
[38]  The Divine Trinity as the law of the Spirit of life is regulating us in a gentle way, dispensing the Triune God into us.
[39]  As a result, we will be saved in the life of Christ Rom 5:10 .
[40]  On the Positive Side Sanctifying, Transforming, Conforming, and Redeeming
[41]  The dispensing of the Divine Trinity as the law of the Spirit of life in us, the believers, results not only in our being delivered from the negative things and subduing them, but it supplies us positively in our spirit, soul, and body.
[42]  It comes about through the saturation of our whole being with God's holy nature by the Divine Trinity as the Spirit of life, transforming our natural element into a spiritual element, so that every part of our whole being can be sanctified unto God Rom 6:19, 22 .
[43]  Furthermore, this divine element anointed into us has a sanctifying capacity; it sanctifies us.
[44]  The book of Romans indeed occupies a special place.
[45]  Today is the age of science, and every one of us knows what a law is.
[46]  THE OPERATION OF THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE
[47]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE GOAL OF THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING To build up the many members into the Body of Christ: Coordinating together and functioning according to the measure of each one part Rom 12:3-8.
[48]  For I say through the grace given to me to every one among you, not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.
[49]  4 For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, 5 so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.
[50]  In order to understand the book of Romans, we must first know the structure of this book.
[51]  BUILDING UP THE MANY MEMBERS INTO THE BODY OF CHRIST Coordinating Together and Functioning according to the Measure of Each One Part
[52]  First, the goal of God's dispensing is to build up the many members into the Body of Christ.
[53]  In the Body of Christ, all the members coordinate together and function according to the measure of each one part Rom 12:3-8 .
[54]  THAT THE UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST MAY BE EXPRESSED THROUGH THE VARIOUS LOCAL CHURCHES Receiving All Genuine Believers Unconditionally according to the Way God and Christ Receive Them
[55]  When we live a life with the highest virtues, the church will become a coordinated and built-up Body that is expressed in all the localities.
[56]  Hence, chapter fourteen shows us the unique Body of Christ expressed in all the local churches.
[57]  Today, in the Lord's recovery, the most important thing is to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.
[58]  But oneness is to have only one person, who is the pneumatic Christ Himself living in us, so that we can do everything according to God and Christ and can be built up in the Body to live out the life of God's kingdom.
[59]  This God is the One who has given Jesus Christ to us according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept in silence in times eternal, who also is the One who has saved us, regenerated us, and through His divine dispensing is continually sanctifying, renewing, and transforming us, and who will eventually glorify us and conform us to the image of God's firstborn Son, bringing us into glory.
[60]  SECTION III The Divine Dispensing of the All-inclusive Christ and Its Functions
[61]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You from our depths, that You have gathered us once again into Your name.
[62]  Lord, we believe You are with us, that Your Spirit is here, and that Your word is opened up to us.
[63]  Lord, we thank You that in this dark age, we have Your bright holy word in our hands, as a lamp that shines in a dark place.
[64]  Under this general description, there are five items which speak of the all-inclusive Christ as the power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption from God to the believers.
[65]  First Corinthians 1:24 also tells us that the crucified Christ is the wisdom of God.
[66]  Through Christ's incarnation and crucifixion, God removed man's sins and annulled Satan, the one who corrupted man, thus releasing the divine life and making it available to all those who believe in Him.
[67]  CHAPTER NINE THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST IN FEEDING, WATERING, AND TRANSFORMING THE BELIEVERS OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING The all-inclusive Christ being the divine dispensing as the Passover Lamb and the unleavened bread, feeding the believers and supplying them life 1 Cor 5:7-8:
[68]  In the last message, we saw that Christ is the eternal portion given to us from God.
[69]  This eternal portion is not a thing, but a living person.
[70]  THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST BEING THE DIVINE DISPENSING AS THE SPIRITUAL ROCK OUT OF WHICH FLOWS THE LIVING WATER AND AS THE SPIRITUAL FOOD THAT COMES DOWN FROM HEAVEN
[71]  As those enjoying Christ, we are the letters of Christ, where the Spirit of the living God, as the living God Himself, and as the element of the inscribing ink, supplies us with Christ as the content, with the result that He is expressed in us, and He is known and read by all men.
[72]  CHAPTER TEN THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST BECOMING THE FACTOR FOR THE GROWTH AND THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING The all-inclusive Christ being the divine dispensing as the foundation for the building up of the church, uplifting and supplying the believers with the nourishing element for their growth in life 1 Cor 3:11, 6-7:
[73]  For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[74]  I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; 7 so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One who makes to grow, God.
[75]  From the past messages, we have received a vision.
[76]  Our God has a divine economy, which is to dispense Himself in Christ to His chosen ones, those who believe in Him.
[77]  From the time we were saved and regenerated, the Christ who is the embodiment of God has been dispensed into us to be our life, our supply, and everything to us, so that we are righteous, we are sanctified, and we are redeemed.
[78]  As a result, we grow in the life of God, and we are coordinated and built up together to be a corporate vessel, which is the church, the Body of Christ, and the habitation of God.
[79]  EQUIPPING THE BELIEVERS WITH THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE SPIRIT WHO DISTRIBUTES SPIRITUAL GIFTS
[80]  First Corinthians 12:4 says: "But there are distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit."
[81]  First Corinthians 12 shows us that Christ is the Head of His Body, equipping and supplying every one of His members with the Spirit who distributes the spiritual gifts, that they would not only be able to participate, by the gift and capacity of the distributing Spirit, in the Lord's ministry of the building up of the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:5 , but by the same gift and function, would also be able to participate in the operation which is for the accomplishment of His eternal economy 1 Cor 12:6 , unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[82]  THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST BEING THE DIVINE DISPENSING IN THE BEHOLDING OF HIS GLORY BY THE BELIEVERS WHO SERVE HIM AND PURSUE AFTER HIM
[83]  Second Corinthians 3:18 says: "And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."
[84]  When we behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, the Lord will also unveil Himself and will transfuse us with what He is.
[85]  Particularly in the morning, when we open ourselves to the Lord and fellowship with Him face to face, the riches of the Lord will be dispensed into us, and we will be transformed gradually into His glorious image.
[86]  According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love.
[87]  In predestinating the believers through Christ, that His predestinated believers may have His divine life and thus may become His sons Eph 1:5.
[88]  And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, 20 which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead, and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, 21 far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming; 22 and He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, 23 which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
[89]  I hope that we would all pray much so that the Lord would allow us not only to hear them, but to see them.
[90]  Ephesians 1:4-5 says that God has chosen us before the foundation of the world that we should become holy before Him, and that He has also predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ.
[91]  God's way is to do everything Himself and work His holiness into us.
[92]  THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF GOD THE SPIRIT AS THE SEALING AND PLEDGING IN THE BELIEVERS
[93]  After speaking of the Father's choosing and predestinating, and the Son's redeeming through which He has become our sphere and element so that we might be made God's precious inheritance, Ephesians 1 speaks of the dispensing of God the Spirit as the sealing and the pledging in the believers.
[94]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY CAUSING THE BELIEVERS TO BECOME GOD'S MASTERPIECE, THE NEW MAN, GOD'S KINGDOM FOR HIS ADMINISTRATION, GOD'S HOUSE FOR THE DISPENSING OF HIS LOVE, AND GOD'S DWELLING PLACE FOR HIS REST OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING The dispensing of God the Father in the life in God the Son enlivening the believers who were in death together with Christ, raising them up together with Christ, and seating them together with Christ in the heavenlies, thereby creating the believers as His masterpiece: To be His church.
[95]  That He might display in the ages which are coming the surpassing riches of His the Triune God's grace of life Eph 2:1-10.
[96]  And you, being dead in your offenses and sins, 2 in which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit who now is operating in the sons of disobedience; 3 among whom also we all behaved ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest; 4 but God, being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us, 5 even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ by grace you have been saved , 6 and raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus, 7 that He might display in the ages which are coming the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[97]  The Father's choosing dispensed the Father's nature into us so that we can become holy, and His predestination dispensed His life into us so that we can become His sons.
[98]  Then God the Spirit seals us and becomes a pledge to us so that, on one hand, He saturates and permeates us, and on the other hand, He becomes our enjoyment as a foretaste of God becoming the blessing of our inheritance.
[99]  In Ephesians 2 Paul continues by first showing us that the dispensing of God the Father in the life in God the Son has enlivened the believers who were dead in sins together with Christ, has raised them up together with Christ, and has seated them together with Christ in the heavenlies, thereby creating the believers as His masterpiece to be His church, that He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of the Triune God's grace of life Eph 2:1-10 .
[100]  Paul went on to show us that before we were saved, we were not only dead, but uncircumcised.
[101]  We were separated from God's chosen people and from the covenants of God's promise, we were without Christ, and we had no hope and were without God Eph 2:11-12 .
[102]  IN GOD THE SPIRIT THE TWO GROUPS THAT COMPOSE THE NEW MAN HAVING ACCESS UNTO GOD THE FATHER
[103]  This causes the Body as the new man to become the kingdom of the Triune God for His administration, the house of God for the dispensing of His love, and the dwelling place of God in the believers' spirit for His rest vv.
[104]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF GOD'S PLAN IN HIS ECONOMY AND OF THE APOSTLE'S STEWARDSHIP MINISTERING THE RICHES OF CHRIST TO THE BELIEVERS AND BRINGING IN THE CHURCH FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD'S MULTIFARIOUS WISDOM OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING The divine dispensing of God's plan in His economy dispensation preaching to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel: To bring to light what is the economy dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.
[105]  To bring in the church for the manifestation of God's multifarious wisdom to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies Eph 3:8-10.
[106]  To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the nations the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel, 9 and to bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things; 10 in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the multifarious wisdom of God.
[107]  If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you, 3 that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have written previously in brief, 4 by which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ, 5 which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit, 6 that the nations are to be joint heirs and a joint Body and joint partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
[108]  The apostle Paul wrote the book of Ephesians in a very meaningful way.
[109]  In chapter one he shows us how the Body of Christ is produced and exists out of the dispensing of the Triune God.
[110]  Then, in chapter two he begins from another angle to show us the history of those who have been worked on by God's dispensing to become the Body of Christ.
[111]  Finally, this masterpiece, this new man that can accomplish God's eternal economy, is brought to God in one Spirit, having drawn near to God, without any barrier whatsoever, and remains in the presence of God to receive God's continual and eternal dispensing.
[112]  For this reason, there must be a process of transformation.
[113]  First Corinthians 3 reveals that the believers originally are plants, but through the process of transformation by the riches of Christ and by His life, these plants become minerals.
[114]  Before the ages God, in the universe, had a desire in Himself, which was to work Himself into His chosen, created, redeemed, and regenerated people that He might be their life and their divine element.
[115]  He does not live in us to be our pattern.
[116]  If that were the case, we would have to do something.
[117]  Instead He lives in us to be our blessed portion, so that we can enjoy Him.
[118]  I hope that all the brothers and sisters, whether old or young, whether they were saved recently or have served the Lord for a long time, would all see a vision.
[119]  Today, God has no intention for us to do anything by ourselves.
[120]  It is true that whatever He wants us to do we should do.
[121]  But God wants us to do everything by depending on Him, by taking Him as life, and by allowing Him to dispense Himself into us.
[122]  THE STEWARDSHIP OF THE APOSTLE IN PERFECTING THE SAINTS UNTO THE WORK OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY
[123]  Furthermore, in Ephesians 4, Paul tells us that God has an economy.
[124]  This economy is for the dispensing of His riches in Christ to His chosen ones who have believed in Him.
[125]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST IN HIS MAKING HIS HOME IN THE BELIEVERS' HEARTS SUPPLYING TO THE SAINTS THE FULLNESS OF THE TRIUNE GOD THAT THE CHURCH MAY BECOME THE FULL EXPRESSION OF THE TRIUNE GOD OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING The divine dispensing of God the Father strengthening the believers with power, according to the riches of His glory, through His Spirit into the inner man that the believers may experience and enjoy: The dispensing of the riches of the glory of God the Father.
[126]  As we have seen, depending on the context, the Greek word oikonomia can be translated either economy or, dispensation or stewardship.
[127]  In God it is a plan, a purpose, and an economy, but when God's economy comes to the apostles, it becomes a stewardship.
[128]  EXAMPLES OF THE APOSTLES PERFECTED TO BE THE MINISTERS
[129]  In chapters one, three, and four of 2 Corinthians, Paul described how he and the other apostles became dispensers of Christ.
[130]  THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF CHRIST IN MAKING HIS HOME IN THE BELIEVERS' HEARTS THROUGH FAITH
[131]  When our inner man is strengthened, spontaneously we will be open to the Lord, and Christ will be able to make home in our hearts through faith.
[132]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY CONSTITUTING THE GIFTS FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS UNTO THE BUILDING UP OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING The divine dispensing of the Spirit as the essence of the Body of Christ causing all the members of the Body of Christ to have one hope of glory, which is the redemption of their bodies, that their whole being may enter into the divine glory Eph 4:4.
[133]  The divine dispensing of God the Father to the Body of Christ in His being over all, as the Father's overshadowing, in His being through all, as the Son's care and concern, and in His being in all, as the Spirit's presence, enabling all the members of the Body of Christ to experience the Triune God and enjoy His rich presence Eph 4:6.
[134]  11 And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, 12 for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ; 13 until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, 14 that we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error; 15 but holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, 16 out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[135]  From Ephesians chapters one, two, and three, we have seen one vision after another.
[136]  These visions conclude with all the riches of God, which can be considered as the peak.
[137]  THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE LORD AS THE ELEMENT OF HIS BODY
[138]  Ephesians 4:5 says, "One Lord, one faith, one baptism."
[139]  THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE HEAD, CHRIST, IN CONSTITUTING THE MANY GIFTS
[140]  Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of the nature of the Triune God and what the church is.
[141]  Then verses 8 through 16 reveal how the One who descended into Hades, who was raised, and who ascended to the heavens, that is, the resurrected and ascended Head, Christ, constituted His many gifts and made these gifts the gifts He gave to His Body through His divine dispensing.
[142]  These gifts also perfect the saints through the divine dispensing that all the saints may be able to do the work of the New Testament ministry, which is the building up of the organic Body of Christ, so that all the members of the Body of Christ may grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things.
