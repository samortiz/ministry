<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIUNE GOD BEING WROUGHT INTO US<br>IN HIS CONSUMMATED STATE</H2><P>The Triune God is now being wrought into us, not in His "raw" state but in His consummated state. God could not be wrought into Job in this way because at Job's time God was still "raw." He had not yet been processed and consummated through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension. Apart from Christ's all-inclusive death, how could we be terminated? How could we be redeemed? Apart from Christ's resurrection, how could we be germinated? We need to see that we are living at a great time&#151;the time after the Triune God has been processed and consummated.</P><P>Our unique need as Christians is the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. The Spirit is all that we need. Mainly we do not need righteousness or justification, nor do we need holiness or sanctification&#151;our central need is the consummated Triune God as the Spirit with His rich supply. This Spirit is now in us and is one with us in life, in nature, and in essence, and we are one with Him. We all need to have a clear vision concerning this.</P><P>I can testify that, although I am very busy day by day, I am not the one working; rather, Christ, who lives in me, is the One working. Sixty-five years ago I did many things, but by the Lord's mercy I have been learning of Paul to coordinate with the One living in me. In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." In 1 Corinthians 15:10 he said, "By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me." Humanly speaking, I cannot carry out the Lord's work today or bear the burden of the churches around the globe. However, the work is easy to do and the burden is easy to bear when it is the processed and consummated One living in me who does the work and bears the burden. I praise Him that I simply enjoy His living and His working and rejoice in Him.</P>
