   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A PILLAR OF SALT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The previous message was on Lot, who was a defeated righteous man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we come to Lot's wife, who became a pillar of salt 19:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 19 might be the only record in human history regarding a pillar of salt, and we need to consider it very carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This pillar of salt was not created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lot's wife became a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is very meaningful that in His heavy word recorded in Luke 17, spoken at a time when people were inquiring about the coming of the kingdom, the Lord Jesus said, "Remember Lot's wife" Luke 17:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a sense, the Lord seemed to be saying to His disciples, "Don't talk about the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, you must recognize what the age will be like when the kingdom comes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It will be like the days of Noah and the days of Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both are prefigures of the days of My coming."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, in the Lord's heavy, solemn, and sobering word, three ages are mentioned: the age of Noah, the age of Lot, and the age at the time of the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we covered Noah in some of the foregoing messages in this life-study, we pointed out that he lived in a befuddled age, and that the people of his age were befuddled, drugged, and doped by their lusts and evil pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, in Luke 17:27, when the Lord spoke of the days of Noah, marriage was mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when He spoke of the days of Lot, there was no mention of marriage, because in Sodom marriage had been completely degraded, and the people indulged in their sodomitical lust.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Luke 17:28 and 30 the Lord said, "Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building...It will be in the same way on the day in which the Son of Man is revealed."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After saying this and immediately before telling us to remember Lot's wife, the Lord said, "In that day, he who shall be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn back to the things behind" Luke 17:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Palestine the houses had flat roofs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord was saying, "If you are on your housetop at the time of My coming, do not come down into your house to take away your stuff.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you do, you will be left.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you are working in the field, do not return home.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must forget everything except Me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Immediately after this word, the Lord said, "Remember Lot's wife."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today, like the people in the days of Noah and in the days of Lot, many Christians are doped and befuddled, having lost the proper sense of the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some even teach that believers may be raptured while they are playing football.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But according to the revelation of the Holy Word, when the Lord comes back, He would not take any of His saints who are still participating in worldly entertainments.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We Christians are the crop of God growing with Christ as the life seed Matt 13:3-8, 18-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No Christian who is mature in the growth of life still participates in any worldly entertainments.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since the Christians who continue to participate in worldly entertainments are not ripe, but are green and raw, the Lord would not reap them from the field.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The befuddled Christians of today need to hear such a sobering word.</S>
