<p>God&rsquo;s dispensation in the ministry of Christ is also to mingle the believers with the Triune God (John 17:21-23). For example, when you put a tea bag into a glass of water, sometimes you help it by mixing it up. You stir the water to mix the tea with the water. That is mingling. Sometimes we want to go home and sleep well, but instead the Lord sends something to stir up the situation. We have to realize that our troubles and problems are for the mingling. We can all testify that suffering helps us to be mingled with the Triune God. The Lord Jesus is not satisfied just to abide in us. He wants to mingle us with Himself. When you put a tea bag into the water, your intention is that the tea will saturate the water, causing the very essence and taste and flavor of the tea to be mingled with the water. This will make the water tea. Christ within you is doing something all the time to mingle Himself with you to make you Christ. This mingling I would call &ldquo;Christifying.&rdquo; You are like a glass of plain water, and the tea is &ldquo;teaifying&rdquo; you to make you tea. That is the tea being dispensed into the water. That is a good example of God dispensing Himself into us to make us Christified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO BE THE OVERFLOW OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
FROM WITHIN THE BELIEVERS<br />
AS THE RIVERS OF LIVING WATER</h2>
<p>This is wonderful, but this is not all. Eventually this dispensing Christ who has mingled Himself with us will overflow from within us like rivers of living water for all eternity (John 7:38-39; Rev. 22:1-2). I am so happy because whenever I speak I have the deep sensation that something is overflowing endlessly. At the end of the Bible you can see a city with a river flowing all the time. There the river of life is flowing and even overflowing with the water of life. In this flowing water grows the tree of life, full of life supply. That will be our eternal living. That is our eternal destiny. Today we could have a foretaste. The very dispensing God eventually overflows from within us to water others and to quench others&rsquo; thirst and to supply others with the tree of life. This becomes their very life supply. This is God&rsquo;s dispensing in Christ&rsquo;s ministry.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
