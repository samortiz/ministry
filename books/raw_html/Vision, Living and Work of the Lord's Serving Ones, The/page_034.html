	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRESENTING THE TRUTH<br />
CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to look at the practice of the church. In the previous chapter we saw the degraded situation in Christianity. Although there are good things in Christianity, in relation to the ground of the church it has deviated from God&rsquo;s original intention. Revelation 17 says that even though there are some good things in Babylon, it is filled with unclean things (vv. 1-6). Verse 4 says that the woman has &ldquo;in her hand a golden cup full of abominations.&rdquo; Gold signifies God&rsquo;s nature. This indicates that there are good things in Babylon. However, the golden cup is full of abominations. This is a situation of mixture. We cannot say that there is nothing good in Christianity. Nevertheless, Christianity has deviated from God&rsquo;s original intention and thus has brought in division and confusion.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 3:3-4 repudiates division. In addition, Galatians 5:19-21 speaks of the works of the flesh, one of which is sects. <em>Sects</em> is listed among the negative sins; it is even listed with idolatry, sorcery, and enmities. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s Word shows that division is condemned by God. When we speak with believers concerning the church, we need to show them pertinent portions of the Word. We should speak according to the revelation in the Word of God, not according to our view.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROUND OF ONENESS</h2>
<p>We have been commissioned by the Lord to bear the testimony of oneness. This testimony of oneness is the most important matter in the Lord&rsquo;s Body. Ephesians 4:3 speaks of keeping the oneness of the Spirit. The oneness of the Spirit is based on seven items found in verses 4 through 6: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father. These seven items can be formed into three groups. The first group is one Body, one Spirit, and one hope. The Spirit is the essence of the Body, and through the Spirit the Body is produced. Hence, the Body is the expression of the Spirit. Through the Spirit&rsquo;s regenerating, saturating, and filling, we have the hope of being in the likeness of Christ. The second group is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism. Through one faith and one baptism, we are joined to the Lord. The third group is one God and Father, who is the Originator and source of all. The oneness of the Spirit in these verses is based on the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is the Originator of the Body, the Son is the Creator of the Body, and the Spirit is the Executor of the Body. This is the ground of oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DILIGENT TO ARRIVE<br />
AT THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH</h2>
<p>Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.&rdquo; Even though we are in the oneness of the Spirit, we still need to arrive at the oneness of the faith in practicality. By virtue of our believing into the Lord and entering into Him, we are one. We are one with all the believers in the Lord, whether they are in Protestantism or Catholicism. However, in addition to the oneness of the Spirit, we need to be one in practicality. This is what it means to arrive at the oneness of the faith. As long as we are children of God, we have the same faith. The faith does not refer to doctrine, neither does it refer to practices. The faith is related to our salvation, and it includes the person and work of Christ. The addition of other items to the faith, such as a special view concerning head covering or a special explanation about speaking in tongues, makes it impossible for the children of God to be one. The Lord has commissioned us to drop all the other items so that we may arrive at the oneness of the faith.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING TO THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
AND STANDING ON THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Based on the ground of oneness, we have the ground of locality. The New Testament shows that the church is expressed on earth locality by locality. Acts 8:1 speaks of the church in Jerusalem, 13:1 speaks of the church in Antioch, and 1 Corinthians 1:2 speaks of the church in Corinth. These churches are all local. Revelation 1:11 says that what John saw would be written in a scroll and sent to &ldquo;the seven churches.&rdquo; It then lists seven localities. The letters were for the seven churches, but they were addressed to seven localities. This clearly shows that the seven localities are equivalent to the seven churches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Acts 14:23 speaks of appointing elders in &ldquo;every church,&rdquo; and Titus 1:5 speaks of appointing elders in &ldquo;every city.&rdquo; If we put these two verses together, we see that appointing elders in every city is the same as appointing elders in every church. All the above verses are basic and can be used to explain the ground of oneness and the ground of the church. We should hold on to these expressions. Even if the whole world rises up to oppose us, as long as we stand on the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we are standing on the truth.</p>
