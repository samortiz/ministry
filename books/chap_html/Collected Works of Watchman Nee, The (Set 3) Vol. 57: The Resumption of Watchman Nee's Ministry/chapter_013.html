<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE TREASURE IN THE EARTHEN VESSEL<br />AND THE PRINCIPLE OF JERUSALEM</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 17, 1948, 3:00 p.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING RECEIVING A PERSON<br />FOR THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2><p>Question: Should the receiving of a person for the Lord's table be based on asking him questions, or should it be based on touching his spirit?</p><p>Brother Nee: It is right to ask him questions. But it is not enough simply to listen to his words. When a person opens his mouth, whether he speaks three or five sentences or three or five minutes, you can find out right away where he is. If a person does not open his mouth, you will not touch his spirit. A man can say nice words, rash words, or evil words. No matter what he says, his spirit does not change. Today no one can know another person's spirit, except through his words.</p><p>Once a person opens his mouth, he gives away his spirit. The disciples said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?'' Immediately the Lord said, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are'' (Luke 9:54-55). As soon as the disciples opened their mouths, the Lord pointed out the condition of their spirit. We must never just listen to others' words. Instead, we must know their spirit through their words. The receiving of a person for the Lord's table is not simply a matter of asking questions, but a matter of the condition of his spirit.</p><p>If a person requests to be received at the Lord's table, and you feel that his spirit is not right, you should deal with the matter. Whoever has such feelings has the responsibility to deal with the matter. All the dealings should only be directed toward the person concerned. If a person should not be received, we just need to tell him; there is no need to pass this word to another person.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY&mdash;<br />THE TREASURE IN THE EARTHEN VESSEL</h2><p>Question: What is the difference between the minister in 2 Corinthians 3 and that in the other places?</p><p>Brother Nee: The minister spoken of in this chapter is different from the ministers we speak of in these days. The minister here is of the New Testament ministry. There is a difference between the nature of the New Testament ministry and the Old Testament ministry. The focus of the New Testament ministry is the beholding of the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face as recorded in 2 Corinthians 3:18.</p><p>Second Corinthians 4 tells us the result of having this ministry and of our relationship with the Lord. This relationship is described in verse 7, which says, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels.'' This is a very crucial verse in the New Testament. The reason we have this ministry is because we have the treasure in the earthen vessel. Outwardly we may be an earthen vessel, but inwardly we have the treasure. We are not only giving the treasure to others, but we are giving the treasure that is hidden in the earthen vessel to others. The problem is that today men only want to improve their earthen vessel; they do not want to show the treasure that is hidden in the earthen vessel. Some people hold on to themselves too much. As a result, the treasure is not able to be shown forth. The principle of the spiritual life is that the treasure is hidden in the earthen vessel. It is not a mending of the earthen vessel, nor an artificial way of improving the natural man. We are not trying to cause the earthen vessel to cease to be an earthen vessel. It does not mean that when a person no longer tries to say anything, hear anything, see anything, and do anything, he becomes spiritual. An earthen vessel is still an earthen vessel. The earthen vessel will never be worth much. If the Lord arranges for you to be a student, simply be a student. If the Lord arranges for you to be a housewife, simply be a housewife. Being a student or a housewife will not cover up the treasure within you. The ministry of the New Testament is a matter of how much treasure the Lord has given you. It is not a matter of how much you have washed the earthen vessel.</p>
