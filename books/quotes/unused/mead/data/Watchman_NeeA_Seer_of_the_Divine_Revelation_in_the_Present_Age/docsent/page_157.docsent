   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Third, he instructed me in matters concerning church history from the first century to the present.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He recounted all the main things which occurred concerning the church, and the way he did it was deeply significant.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He did it from the aspect of the Lord's recovery and with the goal of the Lord's recovery in view.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Fourth, he also helped me grasp the living way to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I had been helped by the Brethren to know the Bible in the way of letters, but he helped me know the Bible in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In all our conversations together, I received much help from him in these four matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A good foundation was laid for my work, even up until the present time, in the matters of life, the church, and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One afternoon while I was studying, he came to my room and threw two sets of used books on my bed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said, "Here are some books for you," and immediately left.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One group of books was John Nelson Darby's five-volume Synopsis of the Books of the Bible, and the other group was a four-volume set of Henry Alford's New Testament for English Readers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I realized that his purpose in giving me these two sets of books was to perfect me in knowing the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition, he also put me into a position where I could participate in the work and minister in the local church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This afforded me an excellent opportunity to learn how to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before putting me into such a situation, however, he tested me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His way of testing was secret.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the beginning I did not know what he was doing; I did not realize that I was being tested.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the previous years while we were corresponding, he did not really know me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when we stayed together for a longer period of time, he was observing and secretly putting me to the test.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, immediately after arriving in Shanghai, I was asked to speak in the general Sunday morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This caught me by surprise, but I gave a rather long message on the pathway to glory from Matthew 13:53 17:8.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time the church in Shanghai met in two halls.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The main hall was hall one while hall two was somewhat secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not long after I arrived in Shanghai, the brothers arranged for me to hold a conference in hall two.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that this was according to Watchman's instructions in order to test me a little.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I spoke every night and was exposed to all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I was on the test for about a week.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Watchman was not there, but whatever I said found its way to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I must have passed the test for I was later charged to speak regularly in the first hall.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day Watchman brought me a bundle of letters from various places.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Various persons had written him asking questions about the church, church practice, life, and about the interpretation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said, "Witness, I am too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I do not have time to devote to all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Would you reply to these letters and answer all their questions for me?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I never imagined that this could be a test, but it was.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I said to him, "There are probably some questions to which I will not know the answer."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He replied, "That does not matter; if you have questions, just ask me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By the Lord's mercy I answered all of the letters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The longest answer I wrote was on sects and the structure of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Watchman appreciated it very much and published it in the fourth and fifth issues of Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Watchman's third overcomer conference was held in Shanghai in January 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many co-workers and saints attended the conference from different places throughout the country.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It started on a Monday.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nearly all the outsiders arrived on the Lord's Day before the conference began.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the morning of the Lord's Day, while we were all waiting for Watchman to come and speak, a short note was delivered to me from him asking me to speak in that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both I and the attendants were all surprised that he did not show up in that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But I spoke in the meeting according to his request and acquired some new experience.</S>
