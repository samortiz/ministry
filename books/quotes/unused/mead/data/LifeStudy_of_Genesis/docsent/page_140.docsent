   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Closing of the Way to the Tree of Life 1 The Reason</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we have seen the ordination of sufferings to restrict, rescue, and guard us and although we have seen the anticipated redemption, there is still a practical problem: What about the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Can the way to the tree of life be left open to fallen and sinful people?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although Adam and Eve had the anticipated redemption, they did not then have the actual redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were still sinful in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If they, being corrupted in nature, had eaten of the tree of life while in that condition, they would have lived forever with their sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God did not allow that.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The tree of life signifying God must not be touched by sinful man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, before the actual redemption was accomplished, God had to close the way to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once the actual redemption had been completed, access to the tree of life would again be possible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, Genesis tells us that after God had prepared the anticipated redemption for man, He closed the way to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 The Means</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is very meaningful to consider the manner in which God barred the way to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In figure, God closed the way by means of cherubim and a flaming sword.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we see three items: the cherubim, the flame, and the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we have said previously regarding other items in these chapters of Genesis, we must allegorize all of the figures in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is absolutely correct to allegorize the Old Testament, for both the Lord Jesus and the Apostle Paul did this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>a The Cherubim the Glory of God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we read Ezekiel 9 and 10 and Hebrews 9, we will see that the cherubim are symbols of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ezekiel 9:3 reveals that glory of God was with the cherub, and Hebrews 9:5 even speaks of "the cherubim of glory," because they were used by God to signify, express, and indicate His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the way to the tree of life was closed by the cherubim, meaning that it was closed by God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's glory did not allow sinful man to touch Him before the actual redemption had been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Romans 3:23 Paul says that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So it was God's glory which closed the way to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's glory would not allow any sinful person who was short of His glory to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>b The Flame the Holiness of God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The flame means fire, and fire in typology signifies the holiness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is a consuming fire Deut 4:24; 9:3; Heb 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Anything common, unclean, or sinful is consumed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This consuming fire signifies God's holiness, and without holiness no man shall see Him Heb 12:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the second item which closed the way to the tree of life was God's holiness.</S>
