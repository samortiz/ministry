The Blessing of the Gospel</H2><P>In the New Testament, the Spirit is also revealed as the blessing of the gospel (Gal. 3:8, 14). The blessing of the gospel is the Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God. Nothing is greater than the consummated Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Regenerate the Believers</H2><P>The Spirit regenerates the believers, begetting them as the many sons of God (John 3:5-6; Heb. 2:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. As the Spirit of the Son</H2><P>The Spirit is the Spirit of the Son to cry "Abba, Father" in the believers' heart and to lead the believers to walk as the sons of God (Gal. 4:6; Rom. 8:14-16). Whenever we say "Abba, Father," we touch the Spirit. Galatians 4 says it is the Spirit within us who cries "Abba, Father," whereas Romans 8 says it is we who cry "Abba, Father" in our spirit. This means that the Spirit and our spirit do the same thing. When we cry "Abba, Father" in our spirit from our heart, that is the Spirit's crying.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. As the Spirit for the Priesthood<br>of the Gospel to Sanctify the Believers</H2><P>The Spirit is for the priesthood of the gospel to sanctify the believers (Rom. 15:16). Whenever we preach the gospel, we fulfill our priesthood of the gospel, and when we fulfill our priesthood, the Spirit goes along with us to sanctify the new believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. To Intercede for the Believers</H2><P>According to Romans 8:26, the Spirit intercedes for the believers. This is another aspect of the Spirit as the blessing of the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. To Renew the Believers</H2><P>The Spirit also functions to renew the believers, making them the new creation of God (Titus 3:5b; 2 Cor. 5:17). Thus, we have seen the Spirit's regenerating, crying and leading, sanctifying, interceding, and renewing to make us not only the sons of God but also the new creation. Such a wonderful Spirit is the blessing of the gospel.</P><P>The Spirit is the reality of the new testament. The unique bequest of the new testament is the Spirit as the consummated Triune God. He is within us. He is sealing us, saturating us, transforming us, and causing us to walk as the sons of God to make us a new creation.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
