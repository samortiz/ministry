   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will fellowship a few matters concerning preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church has decided to hold a gospel campaign during the Chinese New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Gospel meetings will be held simultaneously in numerous meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we will fellowship concerning the practice of the church preaching the gospel and the way that we have learned to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nearly twenty years ago, in 1940, we received a clear revelation from the Lord that if we want the gospel to have impact, the whole church must preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first time the whole church rose up to preach the gospel was during the Chinese New Year of 1940.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s presence was with us, and the whole church preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before we went out to preach the gospel, the church gathered together to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our prayer we touched heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have attended numerous Christian prayer meetings over the past thirty years, but no meeting impressed me as much as that prayer meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It shook the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps some of the brothers and sisters here were present in that gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The saints fasted the whole day and came together in the evening to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our prayer touched the throne of God and shook the power of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We sensed this in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result of the prayer, everyone who participated on the first day felt the authority and power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We felt that God was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The saints later testified that everyone who attended the gospel meeting prostrated themselves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As soon as a person arrived at the meeting, he felt compelled to prostrate himself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was not a physical falling down but the complete submission of a person s will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They could not help but receive the living Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the gospel meeting we showed people that Satan, the devil, is an evil power in the universe, who has usurped man and put man in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone is under his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, there is One who can deliver man out of the devil s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This One is Jesus Christ, the living Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During the ten years prior to that gospel gathering, we never baptized more than fifty people in one month.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after that gathering we baptized at least one hundred twenty people every month for many months.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition, everyone who was gained during that period experienced a dynamic salvation, and many are now serving full time in different places.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the result of the church preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since that time we have emphasized the whole church preaching the gospel, particularly during the New Year celebration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The New Year is a time when people in the world, who are under the usurpation of Satan, indulge in all kinds of pleasures and lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the time when Satan deceives people the most.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the church should rise up during this time and fight for men s souls and for God s name, His gospel, and His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this reason, it was almost a rule that the whole church would preach the gospel during the New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We did not celebrate the New Year according to the custom of the world, because we do not accept the custom of celebrating New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We decided that at the end of this year, 1958, we will use the beginning of a new year to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, we will not follow any of the customs of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord has enlightened us to see that in order to fight against the authority of darkness we cannot follow the customs of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we celebrate the New Year as the people in the world do, we will fall into the hand of Satan and will not be able to fight against him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Neither will we be able to capture the souls that are in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, in order to fight against Satan s authority of darkness, we must not be contaminated by worldly ways, such as the celebration of the New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We accept the years and months of God s creation, but we will not be contaminated by the customs of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are on God s side to fight against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While people in the world are eating, drinking, and making merry, we will pray and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only will we not eat, drink, or play as the world does, but even more, during that time we will fast.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we need to eat, our meals will be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will devote all our time, energy, and strength to prayer and to invite people to gospel meetings, to lead them to salvation, to visit them, and to serve when the church preaches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the saints will be mobilized in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For the past ten years we have seen the special blessing by God and His presence whenever the church practiced this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This practice is not carried out by depending on a great evangelist; instead, the whole church has the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church is a spiritual army in which everyone participates.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the gospel preaching of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It does not depend solely on one person speaking from the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is a matter of the church, not an individual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is what Philippians 1 says.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The believers in Philippi had fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel v. 5 , and in one spirit, with one soul they were striving together along with the faith of the gospel v. 27 . As a result, the church in Philippi was prosperous and full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The brothers and sisters who take part in the service need to receive a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They should not come merely to listen to the gospel but to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not go to a gospel meeting to see how others preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have a burden for the gospel, and we bear the Ark of the gospel together with the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We bear the same burden together.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is a matter for the whole church.</S>
