<P CLASS=INDENT1>When we published our first issue of The Christian, we included a statement stating our goal, standard, and affiliation. We would now like to reprint what we said then:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>GOAL: In this little monthly publication, our desire is to supply spiritual milk to the young believers and solid food to the older ones. We especially stress the salvation of the cross. But we are even more concerned with the spiritual condition of the believers. We ask God to strengthen us that we could preach all of God's will. As to the errors of modernism, we will strive to warn God's children of its dangers.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>STANDARD: The Bible is our only standard. We are not afraid to preach the pure Word of the Bible, even if men oppose; but if it is not the Word of the Bible, we could never agree even if everyone approved....</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The contents of The Christian this year will continue as before. Besides "The Signs of the Times," "Stories," and "Questions and Answers," all of which were included last year, we have also prepared three articles on "The Shortcut to Hell" for this year's gospel messages (the first of which is published in this issue). Other articles which also proclaim the gospel of the grace of God will be published in succession. All our readers may feel free to pass on the gospel messages to others (whether or not you mention the name of this magazine). There is a certain pastor who regularly reads the gospel messages of this paper to his congregation on Sundays. He feels that even though they cannot hear our preaching personally, he still can use this direct method to meet the need. The Lord has greatly blessed what he has done.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>This year there will be many messages especially dealing with faith in the "Spiritual Instructions" column. The articles on prayer by Mr. Meek will still be published. We also hope to print some practical articles written by other children of God. In the first half of this year, we intend to publish "The Practice of Faith," "The Deeds of Faith," "Important or Not," "The Condescension of Jesus," "Bribing the Conscience," and others. "An Hour's Conversation with Mr. George MÃ¼ller" has been translated by Mr. Wang Tze and will be published in the "Testimonies" column. The Lord willing, Mr. Wang will translate other articles for us. "An Unspoken Message" in the "Stories" column is the most touching one. We also hope to publish some testimonies of high school and college students this year. Please pay attention to them.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>We have translated "The Origin of the Bible" and hope to publish it soon.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Concerning the exposition of the Bible, we will continue "Meditations on Genesis." However, each article will be a separate entity. The sixth and seventh articles have been completed. One is "The Story of Creation and the Basic Truth of Dispensations," and the other is "The Story of Creation and the Seven Great Characters of Genesis." Those who enjoy reading this column will receive much spiritual food.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
