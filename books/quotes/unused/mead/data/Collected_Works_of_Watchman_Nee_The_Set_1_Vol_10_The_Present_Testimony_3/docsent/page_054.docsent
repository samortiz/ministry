   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Unrenewed Nous to God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our Christian lives are not necessarily the same toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a believer whose nous has not been renewed we can see the following characteristics toward God: he cannot trust God, he cannot know God in the same way that he knows the Lord Jesus as his Savior, and he has many doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He doubt God's power, God's wisdom, and God's lovingkindness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These three points constitute his attitude toward God: he doubts God's power, thinking that He is not capable; he doubts God's wisdom, thinking that He is wrong; and he doubts God's lovingkindness, thinking that He is unwilling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition, he cannot understand the Scriptures; he cannot understand God's teaching; his nous is not clear, and he cannot receive God's light in his nous.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is true that he did have an enlightening at his conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If his nous were open to God every day, it would not be as powerless or critical as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If every one of us has an open nous, we will receive much enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we can only be a courier, simply passing on to others what we have received without receiving anything directly from God, our nous must be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we merely depend on others to pass things to us and then simply pass to others what little we have received, without receiving anything directly from God, we are not very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am not saying that we do not need to receive help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, I am saying that if we do not receive something directly from God, something is wrong with our nous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I myself like very much to receive help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as the one who speaks receives his words in his nous through God's enlightening, his message will surely enlighten the nous of others and help them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That is why I say every one of us needs to receive something from God in our nous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A person with an unrenewed nous surely cannot know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He may reason with logic, but he cannot know the will of God in his nous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He should know God's will in the same way that he knew that Christ is the Son of God and that he was saved at the time of his conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To know God's will should be a matter of inward knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning the knowledge of God's will, there are many times when we only know that a matter is God's will, but we have no reason that can explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is like putting a newly saved country person with an unbelieving but knowledgeable person and asking them to debate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The latter may argue with the former for two or three hours, and the country person may not be able to retort with any reason, but he can say that he knows he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the same way in regard to knowing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today many people do not know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason they do not know it is that they do not have the organ to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today is the Lord's Day; it can be considered the busiest day for the radio stations in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the big denominations in the Western countries have radio programs to broadcast their messages.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These radio waves bring the sound from very far away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why can we not hear anything?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only reason is that we do not have a radio.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, the will of God should be very obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But because there is not an organ to know God's will, we become ignorant of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It should be as easy for us to know God's will as it is for us to tell the wheat from the tares.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why do we not know God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is because we do not have the receiving organ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is because we do not have a renewed nous.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the time we were saved, our nous was new; we received the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But not very long after that, it became no longer new.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How about our thoughts today?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our thoughts have become corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After we are saved we think that Christians should have a good heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We think that if we harbor hatred toward others in our heart, if we sin, if we commit fornication, we will offend God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore we think that we should keep our motives from being improper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we forget that our thoughts should also be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are our minds, our language, and our thoughts the same as they were before we were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For the time being, I will not touch on our motives and the purpose in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would just like to ask about the condition of our mind after we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is very amazing that before a man is saved, his mind is very unorganized, and even after he is saved, his mind remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His language is the same as when he was first saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His thoughts are the same as when he was first saved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we cannot overcome our thoughts, we fail in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In a letter to Miss Dora Yu, Miss Barber once wrote these few words: "If Satan can take hold of our thought life, he has taken hold of all our life."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not think these few words were loosely spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>She had over fifty years of very deep experience with God before she spoke these words.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>O brothers, do not think that as long as our motives are good, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even though the people we think about and the things we perceive may have changed, if our thoughts and perceptions toward others are the same as before we were saved, we will still make decisions the same way as before.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we cannot overcome our thoughts, we are in the hands of Satan, and we have no way to overcome the enemy.</S>
