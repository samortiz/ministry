[Following this, Matthew 27:33-44 reveals] how the Lord was mocked by men and killed....Verse 34 says, &#8220;They gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall. And when He tasted it, He would not drink.&#8221; The wine mingled with gall (and also with myrrh-Mark 15:23) was used as a stupefying drink. But the Lord would not be stupefied; He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs. [Furthermore], verse 35 says, &#8220;And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots.&#8221; The Lord was robbed to the uttermost by sinners, fulfilling Psalm 22:18. This too exposed the darkness of Roman politics.</p><p>Although the Jewish leaders rejected the Lord Jesus as their King, it was sovereign of God that they set up above His head as a charge &#8220;THE KING OF THE JEWS&#8221; (v. 37).</p><p>Verse 38 says, &#8220;At that time two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.&#8221; This was for the fulfillment of Isaiah 53:9a.</p><p>[By the time of Matthew 27:45, unrighteous men had exhausted their deeds. They had done everything they could. At that time, God came in, in a righteous way to judge this crucified Savior and to forsake Him.] This verse says, &#8220;Now from the sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.&#8221; The sixth hour was 12:00 noon, and the ninth was 3:00 p.m. The Lord was crucified from the third hour, 9:00 a.m. (Mark 15:25), until the ninth hour, 3:00 p.m. He suffered on the cross for six hours. In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God&#8217;s will; in the last three hours He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption. It was during this time that God counted Him as our Substitute who suffered for our sin (Isa. 53:10). Darkness fell over all the land (Matt. 27:45) because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with there; and because of our sin God forsook Him (v. 46).
