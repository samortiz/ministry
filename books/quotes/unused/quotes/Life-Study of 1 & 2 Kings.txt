Through Moses He brought Israel as a people, the descendants of Abraham, out of Egypt through the wilderness to the border of the good land
The eternal economy of God is altogether concerning Christ and for Christ, mainly in the person of Christ and the kingdom of Christ
Now in 1 and 2 Kings this governing line must be realized by us for our study and understanding of these two books
For Christ's person, there is the need of a people to be the lineage of His genealogy to bring Him into humanity
God uses His people to gain a part of the Satan-usurped earth to serve as a 'beachhead' for Him to set up His kingdom
The Bible is the record of the divine revelation concerning God's eternal economy, of which Christ is the center and reality
In understanding any book of the Bible, we should hold this point of view, especially in the life-study of the books of Kings
They are books written in the inspiration of the Spirit of God in the way of being related to God's eternal economy
His suffering was for the conquering of the usurping enemies and the gaining of the good land, the ground for God's building
The two books of Kings present us a full picture of the details by which God's elect remained in and participated in the good land
The record of the first two chapters of 1 Kings could be considered a conclusion of the history of David recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel
The content of these books is the history of Israel, God's elect, from the decease of David to the captivity of Israel to Babylon
God desired to have a people for the bringing of Christ into humanity, and God needed a land for Christ to set up God's kingdom
There are only two sections to the books of Kings: the old age and decease of David and the reign of the kings
David's life had a good beginning, like the bright sun rising, and his life with his career became like the sun shining at noon
Joab, the captain of David's army, who participated in Uriah's murder, might never have lost his negative feeling about David's sin
David's indulgence became a seed which issued in the tragedy of the loss of the good land and the capture of the holy people
As brothers and sisters in the church we cannot avoid contacting one another, but we must always keep a distance from the other sex
David's decisive declaration regarding Solomon was made by the help of the wise proposal of Nathan the prophet
David's decisive declaration that Solomon should be the successor to his throne was made also through Bath-sheba's intimate entreating
Verses 32 through 40 speak of Solomon's accession to the throne of his father as the legal successor to the Davidic throne
Davids ordination concerning Solomons succession was carried out by Zadok the priest Nathan the prophet and Benaiah the captain of the army
According to what David had done for Israel, the people should have taken action, at the time of his death, to remember him
His one indulgence resulted in the loss of the God-given good land by his descendants and in the spoiling of God's chosen people
God still carried out the return from captivity in order to preserve fourteen generations of Christ's genealogy
God still carried out His intention to bring Himself in His Trinity into humanity and to set up His spiritual kingdom
My burden in these messages on 1 and 2 Kings is concerned not with the historical facts but with the intrinsic revelation in these books
To know the intrinsic revelation conveyed and hidden in the holy Word, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation
Solomon loved many foreign women; he had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, and he built worship places for them
Solomon was born of Bath-sheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, and, hence, most probably a Hittite herself , a Gentile woman
The first, given by David, was Solomon, meaning 'peaceable,' 'peaceful' , indicating that David expected to have peace
On the one hand, God forgave David, but on the other hand, He disciplined and chastised David according to His governmental righteousness
The enthronement of Solomon was carried out officially by Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the captain of the army
After some time he asked Solomon to give him a certain woman as his wife, and Solomon rejected him and sentenced him to death
The expression 'an understanding heart' actually refers to an understanding in our mind because the mind is the main part of the heart
In verses 16 through 28 Solomon judged the case of the two harlots' quarreling about the genuine motherhood of a son
Such a wise judgment convinced all Israel and caused them to respect Solomon because they saw that the wisdom of God was within him
Verse 20 tells us that Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand that is by the sea in multitude, eating, drinking, and rejoicing
Eventually the requirement to provide these daily necessities became a factor in the people's rejection of Solomon, a 'kingly robber'
According to verses 30 and 31 his wisdom surpassed that of all the wise men of the east and of Egypt including Ethan and Heman the Ezrahites
From all the peoples men came to hear the wisdom of Solomon and from all the kings who had heard of his wisdom
Kings 5:1-18 tells us that Solomon received aid from a Gentile king, Hiram of Tyre, through an alliance according to a treaty
Solomon sent 30000 levied forced laborers 70000 burden bearers 80000 stonecutters and 3300 chief officers to cooperate with Hirams builders
John the Baptist, a pioneer of the New Testament age, was greater than Solomon, but as New Testament believers we are greater still
No matter how much God did for Solomon and how much He gave him, Solomon did not have God Himself wrought into him
As those who have been born of God to be God's children, God's kind, members of God's family, we have become God in life and in nature
At the time of Matthew 11, the disciples could not have fully understood the Lord's word concerning John the Baptist
We must get into the intrinsic significance of the revelation of the Bible, especially the crystallization of the truths in Paul's Epistles
David was a man according to God's desire to build up a kingdom and to have a house built up for Himself on the earth
Although this building began in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, everything for the building up of the temple was prepared by David
We should compare this with the size of the tabernacle thirty cubits long, ten cubits wide, and ten cubits high
The front portico of the temple a space to receive people signifies the opening the accepting and the receiving of the temple to the people
As believers in Christ, we are the temple and we are also the side chambers, the extension of Christ as His fullness
The door of the side chambers signifies the communication, the fellowship, of the church as the fullness of Christ
The winding stairs signify that the way to get into the church as the fullness of Christ is spiral without corners
Rather, the fellowship should continue to go up and up by a spiral stairway, like the street in the New Jerusalem
In the New Jerusalem from the mount where Gods throne is a river flows down the street in the form of a spiral to reach all the twelve gates
The temple's two bronze pillars signify the Christ judged by God becoming the supporting strength of God's dwelling on the earth
The inner court was built with three courses of hewn stones, signifying the crucified Christ in His resurrection
The inner court was built also with one course of cedar beams, signifying the resurrected Christ in His humanity
The golden lampstands signify the Christ who has become the life-giving Spirit through His resurrection to be the divine light to His people
The golden altar with its incense signifies the resurrected and ascended Christ to be the sweet savor for God's acceptance of His redeemed
In typology the king's palaces and God's temple were separate, whereas in the New Testament reality these two are one building
We the New Testament believers are on the one hand Gods priests to serve to worship God and on the other hand Gods kings to reign for God
The glory of Jehovah filled the temple , bringing the God who is in the heavens to the earth and joining the earth to the heavens
There heaven came down to the earth and the earth was joined to heaven by the ladder which Jacob saw in his dream
Today the heavenly God comes down to the earth and the earth is joined to God by the very Christ who dwells in us
If we would apprehend the intrinsic significance of Solomon's prayer, we need spiritual wisdom and spiritual revelation
Today, as believers in Christ, we are a particular people, a people who are in the heavens and on earth, on earth and in the heavens
God exercises His ruling among His people according to His justice; that is, He condemns the wicked and justifies the righteous
Next, Solomon prayed that during a time of famine and pestilence God would forgive and bring to each man according to all his ways
Concerning the seeking Gentile stranger, Solomon prayed that God would act according to all that the foreigner would call upon Him for
In verses 44 and 45 Solomon prayed that if God's people were sent into battle, God would hear their prayer and maintain their cause
These three things the holy land, the holy city, and the holy temple are the three crucial things regarding God's economy
Our prayers should be aimed at the interest of God, that is, at Christ and the church as God's interest on earth
No matter for whom we are praying, we should aim our prayer at God's Christ, who is God's interest in His economy
To pray properly, we must pray to God in the name of the Lord Jesus , aiming at God's interest for His economy
When these nations went too far in dealing with Israel, God maintained Israel's cause, punishing those who mistreated them
When His elect make mistakes and offend Him, He will discipline them, using others as an instrument for chastening
That Christ and the church are the centrality and universality of God's economy is universal in both the New Testament and the Old Testament
We have received God into us, and He is continuously working Himself into our constitution to make us God in life and in nature
If we do not, we will lose the top portion of the enjoyment of Christ and will be chastised by the Lord in the coming age
There were two altars: the bronze altar in the outer court of the temple and the golden altar inside the temple
The sweet savor of the incense burned at the golden altar, the incense altar, signifies Christ as our acceptance by God
Solomon, with his abundant wealth, built a defense of 1,400 chariots and 12,000 cavalrymen, the horses of which were bought from Egypt
For David's sake and for the sake of Jerusalem, which God had chosen, God would still keep one tribe for the son of Solomon
His glory fell off like the flower of grass , and his splendid career became 'vanity of vanities,' as he had preached
We, therefore, need to discern between what Solomon was in his personal life and what he was as a type of Christ
Capability apart from life is like a snake, poisoning the church; life is like a dove, supplying the church with life
His father David, a man according to God's heart, failed in this gross and ugly sin the indulgence of sexual lust
Even a little failure in the indulgence of lust can damage the church and kill the splendid aspects of the church life
According to Ephesians 1 the church is the issue of the Triune God's dispensing and the ascended Christ's transfusing
He put created man in front of the tree of life, indicating that He wanted to re-create man by regenerating man
Jeroboam took Solomon's extraordinary luxurious life and his heavy levying on the people as the cause of his rebellion
Jeroboam was afraid that the ten tribes would return to their rightful king if they went to worship God in Jerusalem
Jeroboam built a temple at the high places and appointed priests from among the common people who were not of the tribe of Levi
Whereas God had ordained that the tribe of Levi would be the priests, Jeroboam appointed common people to be priests
Jeroboam offered sacrifices on the altar at Bethel to the calves that he had made, and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places
The apostasy of Jeroboam in the above five items could be considered a type of the apostasy of today's Christianity
Jeroboam sent his wife in disguise to see Ahijah the prophet in Shiloh, hoping to get some good news concerning his son Abijah
Although we respect the fundamental teachings of the Bible, the New Testament shows us many things beyond the fundamental teachings
Abijam began to reign over Judah in the eighteenth year of Jeroboam king of Israel and reigned three years in Jerusalem
Abijam walked in all the sins of his father Rehoboam, and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah like the heart of David his forefather
For David's sake Jehovah gave David a lamp in Jerusalem, raising up his son after him and establishing Jerusalem
Asa began to reign over Judah in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel and reigned for forty-one years in Jerusalem
Asa did what was upright in the sight of Jehovah with a perfect heart all his days, as David his forefather had done
Asa put away the male cult prostitutes out of the land and removed all the idols that his forefathers had made
Asa brought into the house of Jehovah the things his father had sanctified and also the things that he himself had sanctified to God
Nadab did evil in the sight of Jehovah and walked in the way of his father and in his sin by which he caused Israel to sin
Baasha also did evil in the sight of Jehovah and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin by which he caused Israel to sin
In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri, the captain of half of Elah's chariots, conspired against Elah and struck him down
When the people heard that Zimri had struck down the king, they made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp
The people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni, and Omri began to reign after the death of Tibni
In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri reigned over Israel for twelve years, reigning six years in Tirzah
Omri purchased the hill of Samaria and built a city upon the hill and called the name of the city that he built Samaria
In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab began to reign over Israel, and he reigned in Samaria for twenty-two years
He went and served Baal and worshipped him, raising up an altar to Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria
As we continue to consider the reign of Ahab over Israel, we come now to the matter of God's dealing with Ahab through Elijah the prophet
We have the Triune God wrought into us, constituting Himself into us every day, indwelling us, and building His home in us
After the brook dried up, God sent Elijah to go to Zarephath of Zidon, where God had commanded a widow to feed him
God sent Elijah to see Ahab and to tell him that God would send rain upon the earth, and Elijah went to appear before Ahab
Elijah challenged Ahab to have a test on Mount Carmel and prove who is the real God Baal of the heathens or Jehovah of Israel
Elijah, by himself alone, repaired the broken-down altar of Jehovah by building it unto the name of Jehovah with twelve stones
Elijah told Ahab that rain was coming, saying to him, 'Go up; eat and drink, for there is the sound of an abundance of rain'
After telling Ahab this, Elijah went up to the top of Carmel and prayed until a great downpour of rain came from the heavens
Kings 18:46 tells us that the hand of Jehovah was upon Elijah and that he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel
Through the refreshing and encouraging by the angel, Elijah went further, to Horeb the mount of God, and there he lodged in a cave
In chapter eighteen Elijah had a great victory, but in chapter nineteen he was fearful and escaped for his life
Concerning eating with the Gentiles, Peter did not keep the truth of the gospel due to his fear of his countrymen
In a matter such as talking with our spouse, we may fail to practice to enjoy Christ constituting Himself into us
The forty kings of Israel and Judah were in the highest position, but they were not careful in their enjoyment of the good land
My burden in these messages is not merely to expound the Word but to learn the lessons from the history in typology
He could also say that he magnified Christ and lived Christ, even in prison, through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
When Elijah was thoroughly disappointed, God came in to give him a further commission so that he might learn something more
Elijah's shutting up of the heavens, his opening of the heavens, and his calling fire down had nothing to do with God's economy
Paul was ready for persecution and martyrdom because he was full of God, saturated with God, and constituted with God
The fact that God spoke to Elijah in a gentle, quiet voice indicates that God was ushering Elijah into the New Testament age
All the realities concerning God's economy are in the way of God the Father's love, the Son's grace, and the Spirit's fellowship
In this message we will continue to consider the reign of Ahab over Israel and then consider the reign of Jehoshaphat over Judah
Ben-hadad reorganized his army and changed his strategy to fight with Israel in the plain instead of on the mountains
Because of this, God said that He would not bring the evil upon him in his days but would bring the evil upon his house in his son's days
After three years of peace between Syria and Israel, Ahab wanted to fight against the king of Syria for Ramoth-gilead
Ahab assembled about four hundred prophets and asked them if he should go against Ramoth-gilead to battle or refrain
These false prophets lied to him, saying that he should go ahead and that God would deliver the city into his hand
Ahab disguised himself so that others would not recognize him, but he was still defeated and killed in the battle
Someone washed Ahab's blood from his chariot in the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked his blood, according to what God had spoken
The remainder of the male cult prostitutes, which were left in the days of his father Asa, Jehoshaphat put away from the holy land
Ahaziah served and worshipped Baal and provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done
Ahaziah sent a third captain with his fifty men to Elijah, and the captain entreated Elijah to save their lives
Elijah went and told Ahaziah that because he sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, he would surely die
Because he had no son, his brother Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah
The first step was from Gilgal to Bethel the second step was from Bethel to Jericho and the third step was from Jericho to the river Jordan
Elijah struck the water with his mantle, and the water parted so that he and Elisha crossed over on dry ground
The children of those who came out of Egypt had not been circumcised, indicating that their flesh had never been dealt with
When they crossed the Jordan to begin fighting to gain the good land, they first dealt with their flesh by being circumcised at Gilgal
In Genesis 12, when Abraham came out of Chaldea and came to Bethel, he built an altar to offer everything to God
The first city that Joshua and the people of Israel had to defeat when they entered into the good land was Jericho
Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, and Elisha saw it and cried, 'My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen'!
When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho opposite him saw him, they said, 'The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha'
Elisha behaved in a way which was very similar to that of the Lord Jesus in the Gospels, doing many gracious and sweet things
The one hundred twenty who were praying in Acts 1 had all been brought to the Jordan to die with Christ and to be buried with Him
Today we are those who are following the Lord Jesus from Gilgal to Bethel, from Bethel to Jericho, and from Jericho to the Jordan
Through all these steps we enter into a new age, the age of the New Testament, where Christ is doing gracious things
At the end of the New Testament age the great tribulation will be a time like Ahabs time and Elijah will return as the same kind of witness
During the three and a half years of the great tribulation, God will be forced to use Elijah again to burn His enemies with fire
Many Christians pay attention to miracles, but they neglect the matters of grace and life or speak of them in a very shallow way
The bad water of Jericho was healed according to the word of Elisha and became good water, water that gave life
More than any other prophet, Elisha did things that, in type, were the same as what the Lord Jesus did in reality
We have especially recommended Andrew Murray's masterpiece The Spirit of Christ, as well as God's Plan of Redemption by Mary E
As sinners, we lost our 'ax head,' our power, but Christ has recovered this lost power in resurrection with the 'wooden stick' of His cross
Those who think that the Lord Jesus did not do the same thing in principle need to read the Gospel of Matthew again
Matthew 3:12 says that the wheat will be gathered into the Lord's barn but that He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire
In Matthew 12:31-32, 34 the Lord Jesus warned the Pharisees concerning an unforgivable sin, the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit
The Lord indicated that Israel's rejection of Elisha and Elisha's turn to the Gentiles was a type of Himself as the Son of Man
In this message we will see more concerning the ministry of Elisha as we consider the reign of Jehoram over Israel
Jehoram, the son of Ahab, began to reign from the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and reigned for twelve years in Samaria
He clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which he caused Israel to sin, and did not turn away from them
Jehoram conquered Moab, forcing the king of Moab to offer his firstborn son, his successor, to his idol as a burnt offering upon the wall
Elisha unveiled the strategy of Ben-hadad to Jehoram king of Israel and instructed him how to stay away from Ben-hadad's strategy
After he was informed that it was Elisha who had unveiled his strategy to Jehoram, Ben-hadad sent an army to besiege the city of Dothan
Jehovah opened his eyes, and he saw that the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha
After Jehovah had struck them with blindness according to Elisha's word, Elisha told them to follow him, and he brought them to Samaria
After they had eaten and drunk, they went to their master, and the bands of Syria no longer came to invade the land of Israel
In 7:1-20 Elisha prophesied that on the next day there would be a rich provision of food by God's defeating of the Syrians
In his ministry Elisha the prophet, as the man of God, behaved himself as God's representative, as the acting God, on the earth
Elisha, as a disciple of Elijah, eventually gained Elijah's spirit, but he was absolutely different from Elijah
When we read the historical books, we need to have a view that covers the entire Bible from the first page to the last
The book of Romans is an explanation of the Old Testament verse that says, 'The righteous shall have life and live by faith'
The first four chapters are judicial, telling us that God justifies us based on Christ's redemption through our faith
We have strongly pointed out that the Old Testament history is very much related to God's economy in the way of typology
If we read the books of history in the Old Testament without knowing the typology, we will not understand these books
In this message on the reigns of Jehoram and Ahaziah over Judah and the reign of Jehu over Israel, we will see the destruction of Jezebel
Christianity is the biggest religion on earth, and the greatest part of this religion is today's Jezebel, the apostate Roman Catholic Church
Jezebel, the apostate church, teaches the deity of Christ but has mixed much leaven with the teaching of the divine person of Christ
Let us now turn to 2 Kings 8:16 10:36 to see what is recorded here concerning Jehoram, Ahaziah, Jehu, and Jezebel
Jehoram married Ahab's daughter and walked in the way of the kings of Israel and as the house of Ahab had done
Formerly, the Edomites did not have a king, but they installed a king over themselves and revolted from under the hand of Judah
At the age of twenty-two, Ahaziah son of Jehoram began to reign over Judah in the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel
The young man did as Elisha had said, anointing Jehu and declaring that God had made him king over the people of Jehovah, over Israel
By this we can see that for the people of God to enjoy the good land, there must be a right and righteous situation
Revelation 17 shows the pitiful ending of the real Jezebel, the great harlot, the apostate Roman Catholic Church
When Antichrist and his ten kings persecute the religions of the earth, they will eat the flesh of Jezebel and burn her utterly with fire
The one who was over the household, the one who was over the city, the elders, and the guardians of Ahab's children rebelled
He burned all the pillars of the house of Baal and broke down the house of Baal and made it a latrine, thus eradicating Baal from Israel
In those days Jehovah began to cut away portions of land in Israel by Hazael striking them in all the borders of Israel
After reigning over Israel for twenty-eight years in Samaria, Jehu slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria
Jehoiada the high priest made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people that they would be Jehovah's people
All the people went to the house of Baal, broke it into pieces, shattered Baal's altars and images to pieces, and slew the priest of Baal
Joash did what was right in the sight of Jehovah all the days in which Jehoiada the high priest instructed him
In reading the history of the kings and considering what is portrayed by the types, the main thing we can see is division
Division comes out of people's ambition, that is, the desire to be higher than others, to be the head, the ruler, and the king of the people
In His last night on earth, the Lord Jesus spoke to His disciples at length of the depths of the divine revelation concerning God's economy
The Lord Jesus prayed for them based upon the life of the Triune God the name of the Father the truths concerning Gods economy and the glory
After His resurrection and ascension, they even stayed together in Jerusalem and prayed for ten days in one accord
After Saul later Paul was saved directly by the Lord and baptized by Ananias, Barnabas brought him into the fellowship of the Body
Paul did not feel good about this because Mark, unable to bear the hardships of the journey, had retreated on their first trip
In this message we will consider the reigns of Jehoahaz, Jehoash, and Jeroboam over Israel and the reign of Amaziah over Judah
Jehoahaz did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah and followed after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat by which he caused Israel to sin
Jehoash began to reign in the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah and reigned in Samaria for sixteen years
Elisha performed miracles of divine healing for others, but, in the will of God, he himself was not healed by a miracle
Amaziah did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Joash his father had done, yet not like David his father
All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah
Jehovah had seen the affliction of Israel, that it was bitter, for there was neither bond nor free left, nor was there anyone to help Israel
Jehovah did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, so He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam
As Isaiah strengthened and helped the kings of Israel, he prophesied that the very God of Israel would become a human child born of a virgin
As believers in Christ, we should now live, move, and have our being in this Spirit and according to this Spirit
The Lord Jesus went through death and resurrection in less than three days, but our transformation lasts our entire life
Rather, we need only to take care of living, walking, and having our being in the Spirit and according to the Spirit
Due to his trespass in touching the priestly service, Azariah was stricken by Jehovah so that he became a leper until the day of his death
He did not keep God's ordinance that only the priests ordained by God could participate in the priestly service
Zechariah began to reign in Samaria in the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah and reigned for six months
Menahem began to reign over Israel from the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah and reigned for ten years in Samaria
Throughout all his days he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which he caused Israel to sin
Pul king of Assyria came against the land and Menahem gave him quite an amount of money exacted from Israel from all the great men of wealth
Pekahiah began to reign over Israel in Samaria from the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah and reigned for two years
Pekah began to reign over Israel in Samaria from the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah and reigned for twenty years
During the days of Pekah, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria invaded Israel and carried some of the people away captive to Assyria
In the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah and king of Judah, Hoshea conspired against Pekah, killed him, and reigned in his place
At the age of twenty, Ahaz began to reign in Jerusalem in the seventeenth year of Pekah king of Israel and reigned for sixteen years
He adopted the pattern of this altar and through Urijah the priest he built an altar according to it in Jerusalem
Ahaz offered sacrifices upon it and charged Urijah the priest to burn all his offerings and the people's offerings upon that great altar
Because of the king of Assyria, he removed the way to enter the house of God on the Sabbath and the king's entry to enter the house of God
During this time God expected a change among the children of Israel, but year by year they stubbornly remained the same
All the real prophets in the times of the kings and the captivity such as Elijah Elisha Isaiah Jonah Daniel and Zechariah were overcomers
Through such overcomers Ezra and Nehemiah were awakened to realize that they had to go back to the land of their fathers
The Lord's recovery is not to gain all the Christians in this age but to call out a smaller group to be the overcomers
The Old Testament contains many types and pictures, and in the New Testament we have the fulfillment of the typology in the Old Testament
Most fundamental Christians, however, pay attention only to part of the fulfillment of the Old Testament typology in the New Testament
In the book of Isaiah two short prophecies clearly show the link between the Old Testament and the New Testament
Isaiah 9:6 says that a son would be given to us and that his name would be called the mighty God and the eternal Father
In resurrection He uplifted His humanity into divinity, regenerating His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God
The life-giving Spirit, who is the all-inclusive Christ, is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God
The goal of God's economy is to work on His redeemed people in order to make them God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead
Hoshea conspired against the king of Assyria, sending messengers to the king of Egypt and not sending a present to the king of Assyria
The people of Israel forsook Jehovah their God, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and feared other gods
The people provoked Jehovah their God to such an anger that He removed them, both Israel and Judah, from their land to the heathen world
Their wickedness went to the extent that God could no longer tolerate them but gave them up and let them be carried away to Assyria
According to verses 24 through 41 the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon and other heathen cities to the cities of Samaria
The king of Assyria used a Jewish priest to teach the heathens the customs of Israel and the things concerning God
As a result, a confused and mixed worship was produced, such as that referred to by the Samaritan woman in John 4:20
Christ today is the heavenly High Priest a Minister in the heavens the Mediator of a new covenant and the Executor of the new testament
As such, He is working not only in the heavens but also in our regenerated spirit, bringing heaven to us and joining us to heaven
We should do everything, great or small, in and according to the mingled spirit, always checked by the regulations of the Bible
The Bible's teaching urges and inspires us to live in the spirit, to walk in the spirit, and to do everything according to the spirit
When we visit others for the preaching of the gospel, we should contact them not according to our self but according to the mingled spirit
In the church meetings our singing, praying, praising, and prophesying should all be in the spirit and according to the spirit
As we behold Him, we are transformed into His image by the Lord Spirit , the life-giving Spirit who is the very resurrected Christ
The life-giving Spirit, who is the pneumatic Christ, the consummation of the Triune God, is intensified to be the seven Spirits
Hezekiah began to reign at the age of twentyfive in the third year of Hoshea king of Israel and reigned for twenty nine years in Jerusalem
Verses 3 through 6 show us that Hezekiah did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done
Also, he broke in pieces the bronze serpent made by Moses which Hezekiah called Nehushtan and to which the children of Israel burned incense
In their superstition they eventually regarded the bronze serpent as an idol, and for this reason Hezekiah broke it in pieces
In the fourth year of Hezekiah the seventh year of Hoshea king of Israel Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it
In 18:13 19:37 we read of the attacking and challenging of Sennacherib king of Assyria with insult and blasphemy
Isaiah told him that Jehovah would cause the king of Assyria to return to his land and to fall by the sword in his own land
Hezekiah went up to the temple of Jehovah, spread the challenging letter before Jehovah, and prayed to Jehovah, asking for salvation
Hezekiah wanted a sign, and Jehovah gave him a sign the shadow which had descended on the steps of Ahaz went backward ten steps
Hezekiah showed the ones from Babylon all his treasury and his armory and everything found among his treasures
In the Lord's work we need to learn the lesson of trying our best to hide ourselves, concealing our masterpieces from the eyes of man
Isaiah went on to say that the Babylonians would take away some of Hezekiahs sons and make them eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon
Hezekiah answered that the word of Jehovah was good and that it was good that there would be peace and truth in his days
God's economy is centered in Christ with His organic Body, the church, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem
Through His incarnation Christ became the God-man, a person both divine and human, having His divinity mingled with His humanity
The first section, from His incarnation to His death to accomplish God's eternal redemption, is in the four Gospels
Christ, the unique God-man, is the model, the prototype, used by God to have a 'mass production' of millions of God-men
As God-men we should have a God-man's living, continually rejecting our natural man and living by the very God who is life in us
Sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification are the steps of Christ's ministry in resurrection
At the age of twelve, Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, began to reign over Judah and reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem
He rebuilt the high places which his father had destroyed and raised up altars to Baal, as Ahab king of Israel had done
Because of all that Manasseh did, Jehovah would then bring evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, as He had done over Israel and the house of Ahab
With the reign of Manasseh Gods toleration reached its limit and He gave up the holy people the holy temple the holy city and the holy land
Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, and Amon his son reigned in his place
Josiah did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah and walked in all the ways of his father David, not turning to the right or to the left
The history books were put into the Holy Scriptures because, in typology, they give us a vivid view of God's economy
The essence of the typology of the Old Testament history is God's economy with Christ and His Body as the center and reality
In one of the books of history, 2 Samuel, we see that David, a man according to God's heart, wanted to build a house, a temple, for God
The One who died on the cross and shed His blood was a man, yet Acts 20:28 tells us that this blood was God's own blood
In addition, the world, which was invented by Satan and is one with Satan, was also destroyed through the death of Christ on the cross
The life-giving Spirit is the Creator God who became a man, lived a human life, passed through death, and entered into resurrection
The Triune God was embodied in Christ who eventually became the lifegiving Spirit the pneumatic Christ who is the reality of resurrection
Today we have the consummated Triune God, the pneumatic Christ, and the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit who is the reality of resurrection
Resurrection means that all the old, natural things have been terminated and that something new and spiritual has been germinated
With us this process is regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification
In addition, he carried away all the seven thousand men of valor, the one thousand craftsmen and smiths, and all the mighty men fit for war
He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and set his throne above the throne of all the kings who were with him in Babylon
Zedekiah, Jehoiachin's uncle, was made king by the king of Babylon to replace Jehoiachin, changing his name from Mattaniah to Zedekiah
Zedekiah did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done, and he rebelled against the king of Babylon
The army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, captured him, brought him up to the king of Babylon, and pronounced judgment upon him
They slaughtered Zedekiah's sons before his eyes, put out Zedekiah's eyes, bound him with bronze fetters, and brought him to Babylon
Eventually, after being ruled by the Babylonians, Persians, and Greeks, Israel became part of the Roman Empire
The royal Davidic family was destroyed, but God kept David's lineage so that He could come to be a man through incarnation
The incarnation brought God into one person, but the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit brought God into millions of the human race
The Head of this new man is Christ, and the Body is composed of the millions of God's redeemed and regenerated people
Pauls Epistles tell us that as believers in Christ we have to live in Christ who as the lifegiving Spirit is the reality of resurrection
In the sight of God, everything of the old creation has been terminated, and the new creation has been germinated
As those who have been regenerated, we should not live by our natural, human life but by God's life in resurrection
We now have two lives in us: the created life and the regenerated life, the natural life and the resurrection life
We will be able to say with Paul that we have been crucified with Christ and that we no longer live but Christ lives in us
The deputy authority of God on the earth is composed of God's oracle, the speaking of God, and God's authority, the ruling of God
After the captivity of Israel due to the kings' failures, it was through the prophet Daniel's prayer that the captivity was returned
We need to realize that these three classes of people the priests, the kings, and the prophets are the structure of the entire Old Testament
