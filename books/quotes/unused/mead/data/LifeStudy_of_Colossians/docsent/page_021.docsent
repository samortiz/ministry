   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PARTAKING OF CHRIST IN THE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Colossians 1:12 indicates that we partake of Christ as the portion of the saints in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since God alone is light, we must turn to God and be in His presence in order to partake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have been called into the marvelous light of God 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before we were saved, we were altogether in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything related to us and our human situation was in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the gospel came to us, it came with light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This caused us to repent to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we repented, we spontaneously opened to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the time we repented and were saved, we experienced something shining within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We believed in the Lord Jesus and thanked Him for dying on our behalf, and we received Him as our Savior and Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way, the inner shining was intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, at the time of our conversion, light entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of us can testify that in the days following our conversion we experienced such a light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In that light Christ became our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although we did not have this kind of knowledge at the time, we did have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, after we were saved, we were distracted from this inner shining.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many of us were encouraged by diligent Christian workers to pay attention to doctrine and Bible teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, instead of remaining in the presence of the Lord and treasuring the inner shining, we turned to good things that are not Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We exchanged the presence of Christ for doctrine, for some type of observance or practice, and thereby lost the inner shining.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The result was that once again we were in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before we were saved, we were in the horrible darkness of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after we were saved, we were in the darkness of teachings, observances, works, formalities, and religious rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some of these things may be good, but they are not Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Having been distracted from God as the light, we lost the enjoyment of Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In more than fifty years of contacting Christians, it has been hard to find any who speak of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you know of Christians who testify of Christ as their portion and who encourage others to partake of Christ and to enjoy Him?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I was young, I was taught to follow Christ and to walk in His steps.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was also charged to worship Him as the Lord and Master in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But I was never told that I could enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was not taught that Christ is my life supply and the portion for my enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we were saved, we had a sense of the sweetness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Deep within, we realized how enjoyable Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then through the help of pastors, ministers, and Christian workers, many of us were distracted and led away from the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We turned from the inner sense of the sweetness of Christ to religious duty.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This brought us into darkness again, and the inward shining ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many of us spent years in this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But one day, out of desperation, we laid aside our religious duty, turned to the Lord, and cried out to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We asked Him what had happened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By turning to the Lord, we turned once more from darkness to light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then, in the light, we again began to enjoy Christ as the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The only way to partake of Christ and to enjoy Him is in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God and Christ are light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we turn to the Lord and come into His presence, we are in the light and spontaneously begin to enjoy Him as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All Christians should read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, it is possible to be in darkness even when we are reading the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may read the Scriptures without being in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do this, the more we study the Bible, the more we shall be in darkness, removed from the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The proper way to read the Scriptures is not only with the mind, but also with our seeking spirit, looking to the Lord s countenance as we read.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By pray-reading the Word we are brought into the Lord s presence in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we read the Bible in a pray-reading spirit, opening ourselves to the Lord, we are brought into His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Spontaneously we are in the light, and Christ becomes our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No matter what kind of disposition we may have, we have one weakness in common: we all like to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But whenever we argue, we are brought into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because we are not in the light, we cannot enjoy Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After arguing, we need to repent and make a thorough confession to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Through repentance and confession we are brought back to the light and to Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we are in darkness because of arguing with someone, we cannot enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We may come to the meetings, but we have no enjoyment of Christ, because we are not in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ cannot be our portion in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He can only be our passover.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, even for Christ to be our passover requires that we repent and confess.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we would enjoy Christ as our portion, we cannot stay in Egypt in darkness, but must turn wholly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because I have found that arguing puts me in darkness, I cannot bear to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Time after time, I am forced to stop speaking because of the threat of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I pray to the Lord and ask Him to forgive me for expressing the self.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Through such repentance and confession the light returns and I am able to continue to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Light is the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we would be in light, we must turn to Him from within.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then His presence will become the shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In this way Christ becomes the portion of the saints in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we would fellowship with God, we must walk in the light 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In many things we may be able to pretend, but in this matter of enjoying Christ in the light there is no room for pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You may deceive others, but you cannot deceive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is too real, genuine, honest, and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In Isaiah 2:5 the prophet sounded forth a call, O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>During Isaiah s time, the children of Israel were occupied with their religion, but they had lost the light of the Lord because their heart had turned from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They had the temple, the priesthood, and the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But because they had turned their heart away from God, they were in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They were not walking in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, Isaiah called them to come and walk in the light of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This was a call to repent and to confess in order to be brought into the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Psalm 36:8 and 9 describe a person who has returned to the Lord and who is in the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Such a one is satisfied with the fatness of God s house and drinks of the river of the Lord s pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He knows the Lord as the fountain of life, and in the light of the Lord he sees light.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In this light the portion of the saints becomes his enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We need to abide in Christ and walk in the light of life John 8:12 that we may partake of Christ in the light Eph 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We need to have more and more contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We need to read His Word with an unveiled face and an open heart.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As we fellowship with the Lord and follow the inner anointing, we shall experience Him as the life within us in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This life is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we follow the inner anointing, we shall be in light.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We are also brought into the light by fellowshipping with others in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In fellowship there is the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Moreover, we need to be in the church life and attend the meetings, for in the church and in the meetings we are in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the meetings of the church we often have the sense deep within that we are in the light enjoying Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>All these are means by which we may be in the light to enjoy Christ as the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Now we can understand why after Paul speaks of light in Colossians 1:12, he goes on in the next verse to speak of the authority of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It seems as if Paul was telling the Colossians, You have been delivered out of the authority of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But now you have gone back into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>You have lost the very light into which you had been transferred.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We have pointed out that in Colossians the authority of darkness includes observances, ordinances, philosophy, and the various isms.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Through the influence of these things, the Colossians were carried off as a prey, just as the children of Israel were carried away from the good land into Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In a sense, many Christians today have been carried away from the kingdom of the Son of God s love, away from the realm of light, the sphere of light.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>As a result, they have lost the enjoyment of Christ as the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>THE LIGHT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>BEING THE REALM OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Light is a realm, a sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The realm of light is a realm of life.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This means that the light of life is the sphere, the realm, of life.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This realm of life and light is the kingdom of the Son of the Father s love.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Light rules by its enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Hence, when the light of life shines and rules, it is a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>When we are in the light, we are in the realm of life, in the kingdom of the Son of the Father s love.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This kingdom is in contrast to the authority of darkness, which is the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of the realm of life.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The whole city will be a realm of life, full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This realm will be the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Darkness is dissipated by light Gen l:2-3; Rev 21:24; 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>When light comes, darkness is scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If you pray-read the verses we have covered in this message, you will learn how to be in the light enjoying Christ as the portion of the saints in your practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>May we all practice to enter into the light where we enjoy Christ as the portion of the saints.</S>
