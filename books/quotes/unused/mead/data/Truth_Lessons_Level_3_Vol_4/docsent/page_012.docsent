   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In one sense, the church is God s family, God s home 2:19; 1 Tim 3:15 ; in this home we enjoy grace and receive the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In another sense, the church is also a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is a family, a home that is full of grace and life, yet the church is also a kingdom, a government.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is our home, and the church is the kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the kingdom we have rule, exercise, and discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 14:17 is strong proof that the church is the kingdom of God: The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here the apostle does not say will be; rather, he uses the present tense is in reference to the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 14 speaks of receiving the believers; hence, according to the entire context, the kingdom is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reality of the church life is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 12 speaks of the Body life, and Romans 14 speaks of the kingdom life.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Righteousness, peace, and joy mean a great deal; these items are the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Christ is expressed, He is our righteousness toward ourselves, our peace toward others, and our joy before God.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Righteous toward Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the believers live the kingdom life in the church, they live a life that is righteous toward themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that in the practical kingdom life in the church today, we must be strict with ourselves and make no excuses for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Toward ourselves we must be strict and righteous in everything we do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Peaceful toward Others</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that our relationship with others must have the characteristic of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Toward others we must endeavor to pursue peace, continually seeking to be at peace with them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must be careful to maintain peace with everyone related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This peace is in actuality Christ lived out from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hebrews 12:14 says, Pursue peace with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 4:3 tells us to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peace and righteousness are always related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Without righteousness, we cannot have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Righteousness must come first; then peace follows.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we deal with ourselves in righteousness, we will have peace with others.</S>
