[2]  To fulfill His eternal purpose God must accomplish two categories of work: the work of creation and the work of building.
[3]  Regeneration in life is the beginning, growth in life is the continuation, and maturity in life is the consummation of life for this building of God.
[4]  Life is God in Christ as the living content, and building is the corporate expression of the Triune God.
[5]  CHAPTER ONE GOD'S INTENTION A LINE IN THE SCRIPTURE
[6]  From the beginning of Scripture to the very end there is a definite line of God's building.
[7]  Among the many items of His creation recorded in Genesis one and two, God mentions three precious substances: gold, bdellium pearl and onyx stone.
[8]  I must point out now that this vision of God's building is revealed only from the high mountain top.
[9]  This city was coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.
[10]  John was acquainted with a temple in ancient Jerusalem, but he did not see a temple in this new city, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are the temple thereof.
[11]  All good Bible students agree that the eighth Psalm is a continuation of Genesis 1.
[12]  Notice, the Psalmist did not begin this Psalm by declaring, "O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the heavens " No, he did not stress the heavens.
[13]  God has only one image, and since His image is one, He can only have one expression.
[14]  First, negatively, it is impossible for any single individual to express God in a full way; then, positively, the proper and adequate expression of God must be a coordinated, corporate expression.
[15]  Now let us consider the fourth key word which is mentioned in Genesis 1 earth.
[16]  God must defeat His enemy and subdue the rebellious earth in order to recover it for Himself.
[17]  When we get to heaven we will be one " But if we must wait until we are in heaven to realize oneness, if we cannot have oneness on this earth, this is a shame to God and a glory to Satan!
[18]  The Lord Jesus, on His last night on this earth before His crucifixion, offered one prayer to God that we all may be one that the people of this earth may know that the Lord is God's Christ.
[19]  It is God's desire that we realize and fulfill the vision of His building on this earth.
[20]  To do this we must see the basic points of God's building work from the entire Bible.
[21]  "The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul" Gen 2:7 .
[22]  In this verse God reveals that man consists of three parts: firstly, a physical body, formed out of dust; secondly, the breath of life, breathed into the nostrils of that body; and thirdly, when these two parts were composed together, man became a living soul.
[23]  If we would reach the goal and realize God's intention, we must first know that we are a vessel made by God and that we have a spirit within as a receiver to receive and contain God.
[24]  The third step towards God's goal concerns a river which issued out of Eden to water the garden and from thence was parted and became four heads v. 10 . Notice, the river came forth to water the garden.
[25]  By experience we know that when we feed on Christ as our life, we immediately sense the flowing of something within watering us.
[26]  The fifth step of God's intention in creation is the process of our being built up as His building.
[27]  But the precious stones God needs are not for men's praise but for God's building.
[28]  God desires to transform us that we may be built up with others as His building.
[29]  However, it is only when we are enjoying Christ as our food that we may be transformed, and it is only as we are being transformed that we may be built up with others, and it is only as we are built up with others that Christ will have full satisfaction with us.
[30]  We have seen that God's intention is to have a group of people built up as a spiritual building to express God and to represent God by dealing with His enemy and recovering this lost earth.
[31]  But before God could accomplish this goal, the evil one, Satan, intervened.
[32]  It is a principle that Satan always does something beforehand as a counterfeit of the thing God intends to do.
[33]  He knew that it was God's intention to have a building, so he preceded God to build a counterfeit.
[34]  Noah's example of walking in God's presence and being for God's building did not last long.
[35]  "And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place literally, he took one of the stones of that place , and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
[36]  And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
[37]  And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: and the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed and, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land...and Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.
[38]  Then Jacob vowed a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will keep me and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on " v. 20 . What a shame! Jacob did not have to vow such a vow, for God had already given him His promise.
[39]  Upon all these conditions Jacob finally said, "Then shall the Lord be my God" v. 21 . That meant that if God would not provide for all of Jacob's requests, Jacob would not take Him as his God.
[40]  Jacob spoke much for himself, but he also spoke a wonderful word, a word full of vision: "This stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house" v. 22 . This meant that not only the place in which Jacob slept should be called God's dwelling place, but even the stone upon which he rested was to be called the house of God.
[41]  We have seen how Abraham was separated from Babel, the city of idols, and was kept from Sodom, the city of sin.
[42]  To share in the building of God we must be separated from Babel, the city of idols; we must be kept from Sodom, the city of sin; and we must be delivered out of the two Egyptian cities of treasure and enjoyment.
[43]  Before proceeding further, we need a bird's-eye view of God's building in the entire Scriptures, especially in the first two books.
[44]  We have seen that God's purpose and intention in creation was to have a group of people as the center of His creation.
[45]  But one night in his wandering he saw in a wonderful dream a ladder set up with its base on this earth, a base which could be called the house of God or the gate of heaven.
[46]  God's enemy, Satan, however, will not tolerate this vision being fulfilled by man.
[47]  In his dream Jacob was told by God that the land whereon he slept would be given to his children and that they would be a people in that place.
[48]  The ark was full of significance, but it was not as full in detail as the tabernacle, the all-inclusive type of God's building.
[49]  When the Israelites were brought out of Egypt, their first need was to contact God.
[50]  Oh, if we mean business with the Lord concerning His building in these days, we must go into His presence!
[51]  In the previous chapter it has been made clear to us that the tabernacle as God's dwelling place is the center of everything.
[52]  With a bird's-eye view we realize that three kinds of cities are in opposition to this tabernacle of God.
[53]  The altar is the place where all the offerings are offered.
[54]  This is the proper Christian experience: as we spend time in the Lord's presence in fellowship, we will have the sense that the Lord asks us to offer all that we are, all that we have, and all that we can do.
[55]  The next item in the outer court is the laver.
[56]  But before sharing the meaning of the laver, we must indicate in this connection that the altar was overlaid with brass.
[57]  The source of this brass was the brazen censers of the two hundred and fifty Israelites who rebelled against God and were judged by fire.
[58]  Upon the base of the brass sockets we have the pillars Exo 27:10-16 .
[59]  We have seen that if we would share in the building of God we must first enter into and experience all the items in the outer court.
[60]  But the experiences of the outer court deal only with the matter of righteousness; we must still have the experience of holiness.
[61]  Christ is the bread of life, and John 1:4 tells us that this life is the light of men.
[62]  It is by this shining then that we express something to God in a sweet sense that is Christ in resurrection as the sweet odor to God.
[63]  It is by all these experiences that we are overlaid with gold, the material of God's building.
[64]  Then, the more we eat Him, the more light we receive; and the greater the light, the more fragrance we have to offer to God.
[65]  It is only possible as we feed on Christ and enjoy Him as the bread of life, as we are enlightened by Him as the light of life and made acceptable to God in the fragrance of His resurrection.
[66]  Within the holy place, however, it is not a matter of the cleansing of sin and defilement, but a matter of partaking of the bread of life, of enjoying Christ firstly as the life, then as the light within us, and eventually as the fragrance to God.
[67]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE HOLIEST OF ALL
[68]  Our experiences of Christ in the holy place are all good, yet they are still not adequate.
[69]  It is not till we enter the holiest place of the tabernacle and there experience the ark that we could be a proper board, a board which is overlaid with gold on every side, a board which is good for the building of God.
[70]  The ark is the sole content of the holiest of all Exo 40:20-21 .
[71]  This means that in the holiest place of God's presence there is nothing but God's Christ as the all-inclusive embodiment of God.
[72]  In the holy place we experience Christ as food, light, and fragrant incense; but deeply within the holiest of all Christ is the ark of testimony, a deeper and richer Christ for us to experience.
[73]  A one-year-old believer may experience Christ as life, but he does not as yet have much awareness of Christ as the embodiment of God.
[74]  He may realize that Christ is God, yet he has not experienced Him as the embodiment of God.
[75]  The more we experience Christ, the more we will sense that this Christ whom we are experiencing is the very embodiment of God.
[76]  But if we are in the holiest of all, we will realize that this is not really a commandment, but an element of what God is in Christ.
[77]  In the holy place there are three main things: firstly, Christ is the bread upon the table; secondly, He is the light from the lampstand; and thirdly, He is the sweet incense, the acceptance to God, from the incense altar.
[78]  Hebrews 9:4 tells us that in the holiest of all, within Christ as the ark, there are also three things: the hidden manna, corresponding to the bread; the hidden law which enlightens us, corresponding to the light; and the hidden rod, sprouting with almond blossoms, corresponding to the incense of the golden altar in the matter of acceptance.
[79]  When we carefully consider this wonderful picture in Exodus, we know where we are.
[80]  The more we experience Christ in a deeper way by rejecting and denying our self, the more we will be in our spirit, which is the holiest of all today.
[81]  When we are thus in our spirit, God will be so real to us in Christ, in the Holy Spirit.
[82]  When we are overlaid within and without with God's divine nature, when we are totally in God and saturated with God in Christ, we are then the proper materials, available for the building of God's dwelling place.
[83]  We must pass through the altar and the laver, we must experience Christ as life, light, and fragrance to God, and we must deeply experience Christ as the very embodiment of God.
[84]  Then all the old nature, the old self, will be put to an end on the cross, and our total enjoyment will be Christ, only Christ Christ as life, as light, as everything, and as the very embodiment of God.
[85]  We come now to the tabernacle itself, God's very building.
[86]  According to the record of Exodus, it is clear that the tabernacle itself is brought forth from the experiences of all the items within it, items such as the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar and the ark of testimony.
[87]  We have seen that these items represent Christ as the bread of life, as light, as incense, and as the very embodiment of God.
[88]  The more we experience Christ, the more we are overlaid with the divine gold, the nature of God.
[89]  When we experience Him not only as our life, our light, and our incense, but as the very reality and embodiment of God, then we will be full of God.
[90]  Each board is one and one-half cubits wide Exo 26:15-16 .
[91]  On every side of the tabernacle are the boards, except in the front, the east side.
[92]  Within the tabernacle is the showbread table, displaying Christ as the bread of life; there is the lampstand, revealing Christ as the very light of life; and there is the altar of incense, portraying Christ as our fragrance and acceptance before God.
[93]  CHAPTER NINE FROM THE END OF EXODUS TO THE BEGINNING OF FIRST SAMUEL
[94]  In the previous chapters we have mainly covered the central thought of God's building in Genesis and Exodus.
[95]  It is the sign that we are in the way of the Lord's leading, that we are taking sides with the Lord, that we are under the Lord's revelation and in His presence, and that we are ready to fight the battle for the Lord on this earth.
[96]  Firstly, God's glory, God's presence, is manifested in and through the finished building.
[97]  We come now to the fourth major point, which is in the book of Numbers.
[98]  Is it not glorious that on this earth God not only has a dwelling-place, but also a camp with an army?
[99]  5 The Tabernacle and the Possessing of the Good Land
[100]  Following the book of Numbers, the book of Deuteronomy describes the good land of Canaan and reveals how the children of Israel conducted themselves in that land.
[101]  We must go on to experience this Christ, but the more we experience Him in our daily life, the more spiritual warfare we will encounter.
[102]  CHAPTER TEN THE HISTORY OF THE TABERNACLE AND THE ARK
[103]  The history of the tabernacle with the ark is vitally important if we would realize God's desire concerning His building.
[104]  Firstly, the glory of God Himself appeared on this earth and filled the tabernacle.
[105]  We must realize that whenever the children of God are defeated by the enemy, it is proof that they are wrong with God.
[106]  The abnormal state of ark and tabernacle in separation lasted for at least twenty years.
[107]  Upon the incident of Uzzah and the resulting frustration, David left the ark with a man named Obed-edom 2 Sam 6:1-10 .
[108]  But after a short time, he was informed that God had greatly blessed Obed-edom.
[109]  The history of the tabernacle with the ark is a prefigure of church history, giving us a full portrait of the course and situation of the church from the very beginning to the present time.
[110]  This prefigures the first stage of the church: Christ was contained in the church; the church was the expression of Christ, and Christ was the very content of the church.
[111]  The fourth position is that of the ark in an improper, inadequate tabernacle.
[112]  King David had prepared a tabernacle in Zion, but it was not according to the pattern revealed by God on the mount.
[113]  There is no need of argument or debate concerning this matter: if we feel peaceful concerning the way of our church practice, let us continue; but most people in this poor condition do not have full peace or satisfaction, because in fact they have fallen short of the full purpose of God concerning the church life.
[114]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE RECOVERY AND ENLARGEMENT OF GOD'S BUILDING
[115]  The six Old Testament books of 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, and 1 and 2 Chronicles reveal not only a history of the tabernacle with its ark, but also the recovery and enlargement of God's building.
[116]  In 1 Samuel 13:14, God told Saul: "Now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart."
[117]  The beginning of God's recovery of His building was with David, a man after His own heart.
[118]  If we mean business today for the proper church life, if we are really interested in the recovery and enlargement of God's building, we must be continually willing and ready to be ill-treated and broken that we may learn the lessons of the cross.
[119]  If the church is to be built up today, we must have a life after God's heart, a life willing to learn the lessons of the cross, a life fully exposed and humbled, a life which knows the mercy and grace of God, and which has no trust, no boast, in its own human nature.
[120]  GOD'S WAY OF RECOVERY THROUGH SOLOMON a One Expression of the Ark
[121]  Now Solomon began to build the temple at Jerusalem at the place prepared by David and according to the pattern which God had given to David 2 Chron 3:1 .
[122]  A final matter for us to learn from God's way of recovery and enlargement is seen in the pattern of the temple.
[123]  When God gave Moses the vision of the tabernacle, He revealed mainly the size of the tabernacle and its utensils, with the weight of a few of the items included.
[124]  The principle we must learn here is that in the church life there are all kinds of gifts and functions, and all must be properly proportioned.
[125]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE STRUGGLE OVER GOD'S BUILDING AND FURTHER ENLARGEMENT
[126]  From the six Old Testament books of 1 and 2 Samuel through 1 and 2 Chronicles we see another principle God's building always involves a struggle, a real battle.
[127]  When God has done something, the enemy always attempts to damage and destroy God's work.
[128]  The New Testament records that one day while the Lord Jesus was on the earth He prayed, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth " Matt 11:25 .
[129]  So many Christians today desire to go to heaven, but God desires to come down to this earth.
[130]  Heaven is so precious to some, but to God this earth is precious.
[131]  According to the record of Nehemiah, the recovery was eventually accomplished, not only a recovery of the temple, but also a complete rebuilding of the city.
[132]  The temple signifies the expression of God, while the city signifies the authority or kingdom of God.
[133]  In conclusion, let us briefly look at the progress in the enlargement of God's building throughout Scripture.
[134]  In the first stage there was something very small, as a building in miniature: there were the tents of Noah and Abraham with an altar.
[135]  Finally, we come to Psalm 84, which says, "How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!" v. 1 . Verse 4 continues, "Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee." And verse 10 says, "For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand." If we would really redeem the time, it is best to dwell in the house of God, for one day there will redeem a thousand days elsewhere.
[136]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE BUILDING OF GOD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[137]  We have seen how the building of God is continually being enlarged, step by step.
[138]  It began with a little tent and altar, but the ultimate manifestation will be an immense city, the New Jerusalem, a building of three dimensions.
[139]  In Revelation 21 the Apostle John says: "I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem and I heard a great voice out of the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them" vv.
[140]  In the second chapter of John's Gospel the Jews asked the Lord Jesus, "What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?"
[141]  The Lord Jesus answered, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
[142]  The writings of the Apostle John have a special place in the Scriptures.
[143]  Going on from John 12 to John 15, we see one vine with many branches.
[144]  Sometimes we speak about paying the price or counting the cost for the Body life, the church life.
[145]  There is indeed a price to pay, but we do not need to speak too much in this way.
[146]  In the Gospel of John and in Revelation as well, we do not see the teachings or the gifts, but the life.
[147]  Wherever we are located, we will be together with other Christians as the living and proper church, a real expression of Christ, a real glory to God, and a real blessing to those who are seeking the Lord.
[148]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN GIFTS AND FUNCTIONS FOR THE BUILDING CHRIST AS LIFE IS FOR GOD'S BUILDING
[149]  The four Gospels, particularly John's Gospel, reveal the purpose for which Christ came to this earth.
[150]  The way for Christ to increase the tabernacle of God is for Him to impart Himself to us as life.
[151]  Most Christians know that Christ came that we may have life abundantly, but very few realize the purpose for which He became our life.
[152]  Ephesians 2:20-22 says, " We are being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone; in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom ye we also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit."
[153]  Ephesians 4:11-16 continues: "And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints to the work of the ministry, to the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at a full grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error; but holding the reality in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ; out from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by every joint of supply, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh growth of the body unto the building up of itself in love" Gk.
[154]  All gifts and all gifted persons are for the building up of the Body; they are not for any work in itself.
[155]  HOW TO BE A BUILDING MEMBER OF THE CHURCH
[156]  We have seen both the ministry of the Lord Jesus and the ministry of the gifted persons.
[157]  We all must realize that as members of the Body of Christ we must care for two things: first we need growth in life.
[158]  Today's problem is not that there is a lack of individual, personal spirituality.
[159]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE REVELATION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM THROUGHOUT SCRIPTURE
[160]  In this chapter we will share eight thoughts which are very basic to our understanding of the spiritual life and of the Scriptures.
[161]  First, the central thought of God's intention as revealed in all of Scripture is to have a group of people who are built together by God and filled with Himself.
[162]  Likewise, in the New Testament era today, it is still God's intention that every local church, wherever it is, must be built together as a corporate body and be filled with God that it may express and represent God.
[163]  Our seventh thought concerns the matter of light in the New Jerusalem.
[164]  The sun and the moon exist in the new heaven and new earth, but they are not needed in the holy city.
[165]  Even so, we will not need the sun or the moon in the holy city, because God is there Rev 21:23; 22:5 .
[166]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH LIFE AS SEEN IN THE NEW JERUSALEM
[167]  There are more than forty major points as aspects of the church life which we can learn from the vision of the New Jerusalem recorded at the end of Revelation.
[168]  Let us recall the vital meaning of God's building: it is that God is building Himself into man and building man into Himself.
[169]  Our second major point is that this ultimate consummation of God's work is not only a tent, a tabernacle, but also a city.
[170]  Next we see that in this city there is a center, the throne of God.
[171]  The city of the New Jerusalem is like a lampstand, holding Christ as the lamp with God as the light.
[172]  God in Christ and with Christ sits on the throne in the city, and this throne is the center of the city.
[173]  If we all give place to God in Christ that He may exercise His authority, if we all are willing to subject ourselves to Him, everything in our midst will be full of light.
[174]  The eleventh point is that with this flow and supply of life there is a street.
[175]  Let us check our own experience: if we do not have the flow of life and the supply of life, there is no way; we do not know how to go on.
[176]  When a meeting of the church is full of the life supply in the flow of life with the light and authority of God, we will be so clear concerning the way.
[177]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH LIFE AS SEEN IN THE NEW JERUSALEM Continued
[178]  We cannot exhaust the record of the New Jerusalem; it is exceedingly meaningful.
[179]  At least to some extent we must experience these points which we are covering; otherwise, it is rather difficult to understand them.
[180]  In the last chapter we have covered thirteen points concerning the real meaning of the ultimate manifestation of God.
[181]  Our seventeenth point is that regardless from which direction we approach the city, regardless of which gate we use, we will be on just one street Rev 22:2 along with everyone else.
[182]  Our twentieth point concerns the wall which surrounds the city.
[183]  Its function is to separate that which is holy from that which is common, to separate that which belongs to God from that which does not belong to God.
[184]  Our twenty-fourth point is that this city has three equal dimensions Rev 21:16 .
[185]  In anything we do, if we have some experience of God in Christ being mingled with us, we experience holiness in that very thing.
[186]  Chapter 12 of Hebrews says that God chastens us that we might be partakers of His holiness v. 10 . That means that He chastens us that we may partake of His nature by being mingled with Him.
[187]  CHAPTER NINETEEN ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH LIFE AS SEEN IN THE NEW JERUSALEM CONTINUED
[188]  We have seen twenty-eight points concerning the New Jerusalem.
[189]  Next, the number twelve is used repeatedly in this city.
[190]  The apostles are also the real witnesses of God's mercy.
[191]  When we consider the twelve foundations, we must recognize the mercy of God.
[192]  All these precious stones were originally mere pieces of clay.
[193]  Historically speaking, there was a temple in the ancient city of Jerusalem, but in the New Jerusalem there is no temple Rev 21:22 , for God Himself and Christ are the temple.
[194]  We may ask, then, since God and Christ are the temple, are They the Dwellers within the city or are They the dwelling place?
[195]  If we would dwell in the church today, we must be built into it, we must become a part of it.
[196]  If we would serve God and Christ in the church, we must be surrounded by God and Christ, and covered by God and Christ.
[197]  Through all the stages of God's building, God finally becomes everything to us in the holy city.
[198]  God's name on our forehead signifies that we belong to God and, even more, that we are one with God.
