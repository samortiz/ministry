Some people separate God's word from His light. To them, God's word is one thing and His light is another. They think that light will come after a minister of God's word opens his mouth, but this is precisely the reason their works are short of result. God's word can never be separated from His light. We should never allow our words to exceed our light. The amount of words and the amount of light should be the same. The general notion of most Christians is that they receive light from God's word. Yet in reality, light is merely something they hope to get; their own words still fill their mouth. This ministry produces paltry and shallow results. As ministers of God's word, we should not only release God's word when we speak, but also we should release His light spontaneously when we speak.</p><p>Ordinarily, light is found in lamps, but sunlight comes directly from the sun itself. There is no need for a lamp to contain the sunlight. In the same way, God's light does not require a lampstand; it shines directly. For the same reason, light should shine as soon as we open our mouth. There is no need to speak and then to wait for light to come. Consider the matter of preaching the gospel. Sometimes a preacher delivers a clear message, and then at the end says, "You should now pray, repent, and believe in the Savior." He is separating the preaching and the receiving into two different things. If the gospel is prevailing, however, a sinner does not need to wait to pray. He would be shaken and pricked in his heart, and he would have repented and believed as soon as he heard the gospel. There is no need to have a separate step of receiving. As soon as a sinner hears the word, he receives it. This was the case when Peter preached the gospel to the Jews. As soon as they heard the words of the gospel, they were convicted in their hearts, and they received instantly (Acts 2:37). In preaching various subjects, our word should be the very light; it should shine into man immediately. There is no need to package the light within the word. There is no need to carry the light within a lantern. Unless our words can impart light directly to others, our speaking as ministers of God's word will be a failure. It is a big failure if our words cannot directly transmit light to others. Something is very wrong if others have to search for the light.</p><p>When the Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem, He was hungry and looking for fruit from a fig tree, but the tree only had leaves without fruit. The Lord then said to the tree, "May there no longer be fruit from you forever!" (Matt. 21:19). The tree instantly dried up. The very instant the Lord spoke, the thing was done. He told the tree, "Wither up!" and the tree dried up. Suppose we tell a little brother not to lie. If he goes home and prays, "Please, Lord, help me not to lie," we have only awakened him to himself with our wonderful words; there is still no light. The lie within him is still not burned away. When the Lord told the tree to dry up, it dried up immediately. There was no time for it to pray, "Lord, have mercy on me. In the future I will surely bear figs." The tree dried up in an instant. As ministers of God's word, we have to reach the same height. As soon as the word is released, there should be great light. Others should be subdued, and their problems should be burned away. The results should be instantaneous.</p><p>As soon as God's light shines, the sterilization is completed. We do not wait for the light to come and then experience the sterilization of the light. No, the light is the sterilization. If light is separated from sterilization, we will have to wait for months and years before we will be sterilized. Sterilization does not come after the shining; rather, the shining is the sterilization. When a minister of the word speaks, his word should carry light. A sinner should fall down before such a light, and a believer should fall and wilt before such a light. This is what it means to have the ministry of the word. As soon as the word is released, others should fall down on their faces. The instant Paul met the great light, he fell down (Acts 9:3-4). He did not wait for a long time. Our words should do the same thing.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
