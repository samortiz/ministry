 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF MEETING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship regarding our need to pay full attention to the way of speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CHRIST AS THE CENTER<br />
AND ELEMENT OF YOUR SPEAKING</h2>
<p>Whenever we speak, either in or outside of the meetings, we should take Christ as the center and element. This requires much practice and experience. If we give a testimony, give a short message, or sing a hymn, we must take Christ as the center. Christ must be the focus, the very center, the element, and the substance of our speaking. Even when a person speaks in a secular way, his speaking has an element and a substance. The things of the world or our own history, the story concerning ourselves, may be the substance of our speaking instead of Christ. In the church we should always take Christ as the very constituting element, composing substance, and content of our speaking.</p>
<p>In our prayer we must also take Christ as the center and element. We must train ourselves to do this. As human beings, we are accustomed to talking in a very secular, common, and worldly way. This is because we are short of the knowledge and experience of Christ, and even though we may have some experience of Christ, we are still short of the utterance of Christ. Our utterances may be so secular, worldly, and common. To use such utterances is to reduce the value of Christ and eliminate the very effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s work. Therefore, we must learn to pick up some expressions and utterances, either from the Bible or from highly valued spiritual writings. This means that we must learn the spiritual content of certain spiritual books. We also should study the Bible and read the hymns. Spontaneously we will accumulate a good vocabulary to express our knowledge concerning Christ and our experience of Christ.</p>
<p>Even if we have the knowledge and experience of Christ and we have the proper vocabulary, we still need to learn to mingle our words, our speaking, with Christ. A brother may give a testimony concerning how he dealt with a troublesome taxicab driver. But as a Christian and one that is learning to live Christ, his story should be something mingled with Christ. He may say, &ldquo;Today I had trouble with a cab driver, but Christ within me told me that I had to tolerate him. The more I considered before the Lord, the more I felt that the Lord wanted me to pay him whatever he asked.&rdquo; By telling a story in this way, he mingles his speaking with Christ and applies Christ as the element in his speaking.</p>
<p>In giving a message or a testimony, one may speak merely in a common way without the mingling of Christ. This is poor. To take Christ as the center and element of our speaking does not mean simply to choose a topic concerning Christ. If we do not have the assurance that we have Christ as the center and element of our speaking, it is better not to speak. Do not speak anything without Christ.</p>
<p>A person may give even a biblical teaching without Christ. This is wrong. In our meetings we do not want any speaking in a testimony, message, or exhortation without Christ. Even the teachers of Confucianism give good exhortations without Christ. We should not forget that we have been gathered by the Lord out of every kind of occupation into His name, and we are now meeting in His name with Him. Therefore, Christ as everything to us must be the element and focus of our speaking. Our speaking should not be apart from Christ. Without Christ, we cannot speak properly in a Christian meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOOKING TO THE LORD FOR INSTANT AND FRESH<br />
 ENLIGHTENMENT, VISION, AND UTTERANCE</h2>
<p>If we take Christ as the center and element of our speaking, we will spontaneously look to the Lord for instant and fresh enlightenment, vision, and utterance. All Christian believers are priests. As a priest you should not teach common things or use common words, utterances, points, or illustrations. Learn to speak as a Christian priest. We are all members of the Body, and we are all priests in the church serving our Lord in a particular, separated, and sanctified way. Therefore, while we are speaking anything, we must look to Him for further inspiration and utterance.</p>
<p>I can testify that when I give a message, I look to the Lord that He would give me the instant and fresh utterance and also the fresh enlightenment and vision. Many times while I am speaking, new light comes to enlighten me, and I see something new which is the instant vision. There was a kind of instant view seen by me through the Lord&rsquo;s enlightening while I was speaking. I may prepare an outline for my message, but when I speak, something new comes that is not on the outline.</p>
<p>The constant word is solid, but the instant utterance always inspires people to the uttermost. The power is not mainly in the constant word but in the instant utterance. We need to have the constant utterance as a base since our speaking should be built upon some constant understanding and knowledge. But the constant utterance alone cannot work out much in a meeting. If we are going to stir up and inspire people, we must have the instant utterance, the utterance that comes to us at the moment. Once we have the instant utterance, our speaking becomes powerful. Andrew Murray once said that a powerful and unlimited speaker always has some instant utterance, something new. If we only speak what we have prepared as an old foundation, this will not be so adequate. Every good speaker must look to the Lord for some fresh utterance and some fresh new light.</p>
<p>The things of the scriptural way will not be hard if we practice them. If we love Christ, love the church, and love the Christian experience, the scriptural practice will not be a hardship to us. If we have a heart for the Lord and the church, we will not feel that anything concerning God&rsquo;s economy is a hardship. A nursing mother cherishes her little babe. Because of her heart for this little one, she does not consider her sacrifice as a hardship. We need a heart that seeks after the Lord and that loves the Lord. At the end of the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved Him (John 21:15-17) because our life with the Lord needs such a love.</p>
<p>At the end of the book of Ephesians, Paul said, &ldquo;Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption&rdquo; (6:24). For the proper church life, we need to love the Lord in incorruptibility, which is to love the Lord in and according to all the crucial items revealed and taught in the six chapters of Ephesians. These crucial items, such as the Body of Christ, the new man, the economy of God&rsquo;s mystery, the oneness of the Spirit, truth and grace, light and love, as well as each item of God&rsquo;s armor, etc., are all incorruptible. For the church our love for the Lord must be in these incorruptible things. When we love the Lord in these incorruptible things, not one of them will be hard to us. The new man is a wonderful, deep, and unfathomable item of God&rsquo;s economy, but if we love the Lord in the incorruptible new man, the new man becomes an easy item to us.</p>
<p>Spiritual things seem very hard for some to grasp because they do not love the deep things of God. When you talk to some people about these things, you feel as if you are playing fine music to a cow. The cow does not have an ear for fine music. However, to those of us who have a heart for the Lord and the deep things of God, messages on these spiritual things are like beautiful melodies. When I was young, I remember listening to a message given in the Spirit and feeling that it was beautiful music. It sounded so pleasant to me and was so easy to understand. As those who have a heart for the Lord, we need to learn to look to the Lord for His instant, refreshing enlightenment that we may have a new vision to speak with new utterances.</p>
