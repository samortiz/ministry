All Bible students know that this book is about the church. What is revealed and mentioned in Ephesians is a deep matter. The thoughts contained in it are the deepest thoughts in the New Testament. Nearly all the main points in this book are beyond our concept. In our natural concept we do not have the kind of thoughts revealed here. It is easy to have certain concepts about religion, morality, and doing good. We may easily have thoughts about certain doctrines, teachings, knowledge, work, and service. Our minds are busy with these thoughts because these things are so familiar to the natural mentality. However, this book contains something that is one hundred percent different from all these things.<h2 class=head1>A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION</h2><p>Therefore, in order to understand this book, we need spiritual revelation. This is why in the first chapter of this book, at the very outset, the writer offers a prayer asking that the Lord would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we may fully know not religious things, moral things, or mere doctrines and teachings but the things of God&#8217;s eternal purpose (1:17). Please notice that the spirit mentioned in this prayer, strictly speaking, is not the Holy Spirit. Today Christians talk much about the Holy Spirit but almost entirely neglect the human spirit.<p>We need not only the Holy Spirit; even more we need our human spirit which is able to cooperate with the Holy Spirit. We may illustrate this with sunshine and electricity. The sun may shine brightly, but what we need is a clear window to receive the sunlight. The sunshine itself is no problem, but there may be a problem with the window. Likewise, there may be no problem with the electricity, but there may be a problem with the light bulb. Although electricity is installed in a building, we still need a proper light bulb. Without the proper bulb to cooperate with the electricity, the electricity cannot be applied to perform its function. After the day of resurrection and the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit in all His aspects was given to the believers. He was imparted into the church and poured out upon the church. Therefore, with the Holy Spirit there is no problem. The only need is with us, and this need is a matter of our spirit. However, we may pay much attention to the Holy Spirit while neglecting our human spirit, which is where the real need is.<p>Ephesians 1:17 says, &#8220;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.&#8221; It is very good that many versions of the Bible use the word spirit here without capitalizing it. It is difficult to discern whether the word spirit in passages such as this one refers to the human spirit or the Holy Spirit, but in this passage it refers to our spirit more than the Holy Spirit. We need a spirit, not only a heart, of wisdom and revelation. In order to understand the book of Ephesians, our mind is of secondary importance. The primary matter is that we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Therefore, we should know the difference between the spirit and the heart, and we should try to exercise our spirit that it may be strengthened, clean, alert, and one of wisdom and revelation. Then we can realize the things revealed in this book in a spiritual way, not in a religious, moral, or ethical way or merely in the way of knowledge.<p>I hate to see that Christians know the Scriptures merely in the way of ethics. The disciples of Confucius always take the way of ethics to understand religious books. Even when the holy Scriptures come into their hands, they understand them in an ethical way. Today, many regenerated Christians try to do the same thing. In order to know the Scriptures we need to be delivered from this way. Our understanding and realization must be delivered from understanding the Scriptures in the way of ethics. The way of ethics belongs one hundred percent to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, not to the tree of life. Rather, we must have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. A spirit of wisdom and revelation is related to the tree of life.<p>In order to realize something from the book of Ephesians, we must exercise our spirit. We must forget about our natural mentality, natural concepts, mere doctrines and teachings, our religious understanding, and the way of ethics. If we give up all these things, it will be easy to have a spirit of wisdom and revelation. Then we will see the things concerning God&#8217;s purpose in God&#8217;s light. We will understand the things mentioned in this book in an accurate way.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
