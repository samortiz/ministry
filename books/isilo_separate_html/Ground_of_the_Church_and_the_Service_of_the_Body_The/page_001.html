<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is a collection of words of fellowship given in 1957 by Witness Lee to the co-workers and serving ones in the churches. The first chapter concerns the relationship between the church, the workers, and the work. Based on the content, it is believed to have been spoken in the Philippines. The remaining eight chapters were spoken in Taipei. Chapters 2 and 3 were spoken to the co-workers and concern the ground of the church and the principle of the work. Chapters 4 through 8 contain words of fellowship given to those responsible for the meetings of the church in Taipei. The last chapter consists of fellowship given to the full-time serving ones.</p><br>Home | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> </body></html>
