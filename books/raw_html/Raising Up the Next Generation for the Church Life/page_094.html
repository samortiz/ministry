        <h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL BEGINNING WITH<br />
RELATIVES AND INTIMATE FRIENDS</h2>
<p>Every lover of the Lord must be like paste; he must be able to be spread anywhere. Whoever touches us should get stuck to us. The lovers of the Lord cannot be like steel plates; they cannot have a hard and unyielding personality. If so, they will not bear fruit even if they love the Lord until they die. Every brother and sister who is like paste is able to catch men. (<em>Key Points on the Home Meetings,</em> p. 60)</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTACTING PEOPLE<br />
BY ENTERING INTO THEIR SITUATION</h2>
<p>When we contact people, we must be able to enter into their situation and condition. This is difficult. In his Gospel, John records at least nine cases of the Lord&rsquo;s contacting people. In each instance, the Lord reached people in a different way. He never used only one way of reaching people. He reached people with God&rsquo;s unique purpose, but He did not do so according to His disposition. Rather, He contacted them according to their situation and condition. In John 3 the Lord knew that Nicodemus would come to Him. He did not visit Nicodemus at his house because He knew that this would have been inconvenient for him. He realized that Nicodemus was timid, fearing that others might learn that Jesus had come to see him. Thus, the Lord remained home, waiting for that timid gentleman to come to Him. The case of the Samaritan woman was different. According to John 4, the Lord &ldquo;had to pass through Samaria&rdquo; (v. 4). Having arrived at the well of Sychar, He waited there for the Samaritan woman to come to Him. This is a marvelous example of how the Lord Jesus entered into someone&rsquo;s situation. This is the basic principle of incarnation.</p>
<p>Incarnation means that God comes to man in man&rsquo;s condition, reaching people by entering into their situation. The Lord did not stay in heaven and command people to contact Him. No, He became a man and entered into our situation. Having become a man, He conducted His outreach by constantly coming into the condition of people. He did not just go to the people themselves, but He entered into their situation. He knew that the Samaritan woman would be thirsty; hence, He waited for her at the well. When He met her, He did not say, &ldquo;Have you been saved? How long have you been a Christian? What church do you go to?&rdquo; The Lord did not ask any of these religious questions. Rather, He said, &ldquo;Give Me something to drink&rdquo; (v. 7). By this simple word, He touched her heart, for she was wholly occupied with the matter of drinking water, even coming out at noon, an extraordinary time for drawing water. When you go to reach people, do not contact them according to your tradition, background, or disposition. Look to the Lord, that, with His help, you will be able to enter into their condition and situation.</p>
<p>Consider the example of the impotent man in John chapter 5. In chapter 3 Nicodemus came all the way to the Lord, and in chapter 4 the Lord Jesus met the Samaritan woman midway. But in chapter 5 the Lord went all the way to the impotent man. Once again we see that the Lord reached people by getting into their situation. In John chapter 5 the Lord came to a man who had been impotent for thirty-eight years. The Lord did not ask him, &ldquo;Do you read the Bible?&rdquo; If He had said this, the sick man would have responded, &ldquo;Get away from me! I don&rsquo;t care about the Bible.&rdquo; Without entering into a person&rsquo;s situation, you cannot touch his heart and feeling, and he will never respond to you. The Lord said to this man, &ldquo;Do you want to get well?&rdquo; (v. 6). The impotent man was, of course, very interested in this. (<em>Young People&rsquo;s Training,</em> pp. 51-52)</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCOMMODATING ALL KINDS OF PERSONS</h2>
<p>From the Bible we can realize that for others&rsquo; profit, we must learn to accommodate their character, their age, their disposition, and even their ways of doing certain things. This need is especially obvious in America because it is such a melting pot of all kinds of people. We must not forget that in our going out to preach the gospel, we are going not only for individuals but for families. This requires us to learn to be human. (<em>The Exercise and Practice of the God-ordained Way,</em> p. 90)</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO PERSONAL CONTACT</h2>
<p>Sixth, all those who care for the work among the young people must pay attention to doing a personal work. The power and effect of doing a personal work with the young people are many times greater than the meetings. Big meetings do not have much effect on young people; individual contact is most effective. When you gather them together, usually all you can do is give them a message and at most a little work of revival. The emphasis of a genuine work with young people is individual contact. If you ask me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, how would you do the young people&rsquo;s work?&rdquo; I would answer you by saying, &ldquo;I can do it without holding any big meetings from the beginning to the end of the year but just absolutely working with them individually by personal contact.&rdquo; It seems this way is fragmentary and wastes a lot of time. You may be able to contact only one person in an hour, and sometimes you may not be able to contact even one person after half a day. It seems time is pitifully wasted. Seemingly, this way is less effective than holding big meetings where you can speak to hundreds of people at once. Rather, experience tells us that holding big meetings is useless. If you hold big meetings all year round, there may not be much result. All you gain will be some shallow ones. Please remember, however, if you pay attention to individual contact, although you may not gain one person in a month or may gain only one person in two months, each one who is gained through your personal contact counts. Moreover, like you, he will contact others. You have gained one, but eventually this one will become two, two will become four, four will become eight, and eight will become sixteen, and every one of them will be solid. After some time you will see a great number of people gained.</p>
<p>I hope that all the ones doing the young students&rsquo; work, whether it is bringing them to salvation, helping them to be spiritual, or leading them to preach the gospel, will pay attention to individual contact. From 1946 to 1948, when we were in the regions of Shanghai and Nanking, we did not actually have any students&rsquo; meetings or young people&rsquo;s meetings. Most of our work was carried out by individual contact, yet the result was quite good. If the brothers neglect individual contact and pay attention only to young people&rsquo;s meetings, I can say with certainty that after having so many meetings, the young people&rsquo;s work will end up with something that is only on the surface, like loose sand without foundation. It will not be able to produce any solid ones. If you want to produce solid ones, you must have personal contact. You must not be disappointed with anyone; rather, you would spend time to contact everyone individually.</p>
<p>Of course, in the matter of personal contact, skills are needed. But if you practice this matter seriously, gradually you will gain experience and insight. You will know which one among so many young people should be contacted and gained first. Later, after that one has been gained by the Lord, one thing is sure: Since you stirred him up in this way, he will go to stir others up in the same way. This is just like a machine with so many gear wheels; when one wheel turns, all the other wheels also turn. In this way, one by one will be affected, just like the unending multiplication of offspring. Therefore, you can see that even if there are no big meetings, many can still get saved and many can still be raised up to love the Lord. That is the time when you can begin to hold big meetings, and no matter what you speak, they will receive it. Then the meetings will be one hundred percent effective. You will be able to gain solid young people and do a deep work in them.</p>
<p>When you have personal contact with young people, on the one hand, you need to have broad contact with them, treating every one of them equally; on the other hand, you need to have specific contact. What I mean by specific contact is that you need to exercise your spiritual insight and follow the Spirit&rsquo;s leading to sense which ones, among so many young students, you should lead to the Lord first. Then you should spend your effort on them to help them receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. In the same way, among so many young brothers and sisters, you need to feel and see which ones, once they are gained, will have impact on others. Then you should spend your effort on them first and help them to love and pursue the Lord. Once they are raised up, they will influence the other young brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Therefore, in doing the work among the young people, on the one hand, you need to have broad contact with them, dealing with them in a general way; on the other hand, you need to have specific contact, helping the ones who can take the lead and influence others. If you gain one, I repeat, he will go and help others without your teaching him. Because you have helped him in this way, he will go to help others in the same way. As a result, one will become two, two will become four, and so on. This is like the ripple effect achieved by throwing a stone in the center of the water. The ripple will eventually spread to cover the entire surface of the lake. Then you can hold big meetings, and they will be effective. If you hold big meetings from the outset, there will be only a twenty percent effect, and the other eighty percent will amount to zero. If you are willing to start from individual contact and then go on to big meetings, the messages you give will be practical and the work you do will produce a hundred percent result.</p>
<p>All the points above are some of the experiences I have gained from touching the young people&rsquo;s work in the past years. Any matter has its own intricacy and requires experience. In particular, matters such as leading people to salvation, helping people to love the Lord, and bringing people to serve the Lord are very deep and very fine, consisting of many intricate points. Yes, it is the Spirit&rsquo;s work, but we all know that the Spirit needs the proper ones to coordinate with Him. Some can coordinate with the Spirit, but others cannot. Some are useful in the hands of the Spirit, but others are useless. We need to pay attention and study these matters when we start to do this work.</p>
<p>These six points which I have fellowshipped with you all are just an introduction. If you will take this fellowship and go on, you will learn more and make more progress. You will find better ways to lead the young people to the Lord to receive His salvation.</p>
<p>Brothers, I say again, the Lord has a great need for the young people. This generation needs many young people to rise up in a strong way to receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and be led by the Lord to become useful vessels in His hands. May the Lord be gracious to us that in His work and in the church we will treasure the souls of the young people. Not only will we not hinder them or damage them, but we will aggressively attract them, perfect them, lead them, and cultivate them so that they will experience the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and receive the Lord&rsquo;s building up to become useful ones in the Lord&rsquo;s hands. I truly hope that all the brothers and sisters will pray faithfully for this matter before the Lord for the future of the Lord&rsquo;s work. (<em>How to Lead the Young People,</em> pp. 31-37)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>We speak too much, preach too much, and teach too much with very little visiting. Most people are gained by face-to-face contact, and most people are retained and built by such personal contact.</p>
<p>It seems difficult for us to gain new ones because we do not have the practice of visiting people. We all have to see this secret. If we do not pick up the practice of visiting people and talking to them face to face, the mere teaching of the new way, the biblical way, the God-ordained way, will not work. Only one thing works&mdash;visiting people and seeing them face to face.</p>
<p>All of us need to rise up to visit people, contacting them with Christ. As long as we pick up this practice, we have the secret. Just like in fighting with new weapons, we can win the battle for the increase of the church with the &ldquo;new weapon&rdquo; of visiting people.</p>
<p>When some of us visit people, we talk too much. We try to gain them by gaining their mind. This is wrong. We gain people by gaining an intimacy with them, by showing an intimate concern for them. If we merely teach them to help their understanding, they will not follow us. But if we visit them and become intimate with them in a proper way, we will gain them for the Lord. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 11: The Eldership and the God-ordained Way (3),</em> pp. 82-83)</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
