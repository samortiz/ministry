CONCERNING BROTHER T. AUSTIN-SPARKS</h2>
<p>Our relationship with Brother Austin-Sparks was not based on the ground of the church; rather, it was based on spiritual matters. We were clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s desire for us in the East; we also felt that we should receive a supply from other ministries. Even though other ministries might not have a clear ground, position, or background, they do have a portion in the spiritual ministry. This principle applies to those who are alive and to those who have passed away. Madame Guyon, for instance, had a spiritual ministry, but she was a Catholic. The fact that she was in Catholicism should not be a reason for us to reject the spiritual supply from her portion. However, this does not mean that we will receive the things of Catholicism. According to this principle, we should receive the supply from Dr. F. B. Meyer, Andrew Murray, and Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis. We received all the spiritual riches that we could find in the books written over the centuries, whether they were related to the gospel, life, or truth. However, we rejected their stand, that is, the organization they represented, because it did not correspond with our testimony and would even damage our testimony.</p>
<p>Brother Nee fellowshipped with Brother Austin-Sparks concerning this matter. Brother Nee also did his best to receive the spiritual help from Brother Austin-Sparks&rsquo; group, but the ground of the church was not a factor in our relationship with Brother Austin-Sparks. For this reason, Brother Nee said that Brother Austin-Sparks was not as clear as we were related to the ground of the church, and we did not ask Brother Austin-Sparks his position concerning the ground.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD BROTHER AUSTIN-SPARKS</h2>
<p>Brother Austin-Sparks&rsquo; group in London has left the denominations. Hence, he is clearer in his standing than Andrew Murray and more advanced than Dr. Meyer or Mrs. Penn-Lewis. Therefore, on the positive side, he is nearly irreproachable. On the negative side, however, he is not as definite as we who are in the East. We saw that the ground of the church is unique and that there should be only one church in one locality. We were very clear concerning this point from the beginning. Even though we differ from Brother Austin-Sparks regarding the ground, this did not cause us to reject him or his spiritual supply. Our attitude was to receive the spiritual supply from all the ministries the Lord has given to His church over the centuries, regardless of their standing or background. We would not be affected by their background. This was our attitude.</p>
<p>Since Brother Austin-Sparks&rsquo; view differs from ours related to the ground, Brother Nee said that the time had not yet come to invite him. Not only so, Brother Austin-Sparks also has a certain spiritual influence on others; hence, if we had invited him to China, it would have caused a problem. It was not until later that we understood this. I am mentioning this so that we can see our testimony and the proper attitude we should maintain regarding this testimony.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROBLEMS BROUGHT IN THROUGH<br />
BROTHER AUSTIN-SPARKS&rsquo; SECOND VISIT TO TAIWAN</h2>
<p>Brother Austin-Sparks&rsquo; first visit to Taiwan was for our spiritual supply. It did not cause any problems because we did not touch the ground. It was a very pleasant time. His second visit, however, caused us much grief. Brother Austin-Sparks should have maintained the attitude of ministering a spiritual supply and should not have touched the ground. If he had done this, there would not have been any problems. However, in his second trip Brother Austin-Sparks overstepped the boundary of his ministry and not only inquired concerning the practice of the church ground but also interfered.</p>
<p>A brother suggested that perhaps I misunderstood Brother Austin-Sparks. I had also hoped that it was a misunderstanding and that Brother Austin-Sparks did not oppose us on this matter. During his visit a number of saints began to waver, considering that it was not necessary to pay attention to the ground but that it was sufficient to be spiritual. This proves that it was not a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Brother Austin-Sparks reprimanded us openly, not just in private conversations. In a meeting he openly said, &ldquo;You limit Christ to a locality and thus make Christ a small Christ and the church a small church.&rdquo; This word proves that he insisted on his view. This was the problem we encountered.</p>
<p>We should be clear concerning the testimony the Lord desires us to keep in His recovery. We thank the Lord for anyone among us who is powerful in the gospel for the salvation of souls. However, we will be troubled if you act or speak in a way that affects the ground and our testimony. As long as what you do does not affect this testimony and the ground, you can exercise your portion, and we will welcome you and regard you as a co-worker, a dear brother or sister. We are not narrow.</p>
<p>For example, there was a sister in Hong Kong who did not see the ground but had spiritual fellowship with us. This sister had a burden to serve the Lord in the East. Because she wanted to be with a group of God&rsquo;s children whom she considered to be pleasing to God&rsquo;s will and who were spiritual, she chose us. Her joining us was related to the spiritual supply, not the ground. We, therefore, received her as our co-worker even though she was not clear concerning the ground. This is because, spiritually speaking, she truly was our co-worker. She did not interfere with our practice concerning the ground. She endeavored to exercise her portion so that the brothers and sisters could be edified. We recognized her supply, and we did not compel her to be one with us concerning the ground. She did not have problems with us. However, she needed to be clear that she joined a group of brothers and sisters who were standing on the ground. They were united on the ground. Even if the leading ones among them turned away to love the world, they would still take this way, because this is the way the Lord desires.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
