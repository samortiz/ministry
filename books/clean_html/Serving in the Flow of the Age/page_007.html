AND CONTROLLED BY VISION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT, SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER<br />
IN PSALMS, HYMNS, AND SPIRITUAL SONGS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:18-19 says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; The meaning of these verses in the original Greek is difficult to convey with Chinese grammar. The original Greek text indicates that we are filled in spirit when we speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. According to the grammatical structure in Greek, being filled in spirit and speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs occur simultaneously.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo; Although teaching seemingly involves merely speaking words, this verse refers to teaching one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. This emphasizes our need to turn from our mind in order to release our spirit, to speak in spirit, and to teach in spirit. This kind of teaching provides more than doctrines for the mind; it supplies nourishment in our spirit.</p>
<p>Teaching one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs deals with our habit of remaining in our mind, which frustrates the release of our spirit. When we speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, we are simultaneously filled in spirit. Even though it is not easy to turn from our mind to our spirit, we should exercise to speak from our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO PRINCIPLES OF LIVING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A Christian Living in the Calculation of the Mind</h2>
<p>The spirituality of many brothers and sisters often is not the spontaneous issue of living in the spirit; instead, it is the issue of human effort. When we wake up in the morning, our thoughts are often focused only on how we should act, and we begin to calculate and plan what to do and what not to do. Such human effort is based on the mind; it does not come out of living in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contacting the Lord in Spirit<br />
and Living by the Lord in Spirit</h2>
<p>Living in spirit is a spontaneous response to contacting the Lord in our spirit and living by the Lord in our spirit; it is not related to calculating what we should or should not do. Everything that we do should be based on the fact that its source is our spirit, not on whether we regard it as right or wrong. A Christian should care only for living in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Meetings, Messages, and Prayers Needing to Be<br />
the Spontaneous Living Out of the Spirit</h2>
<p>According to my observation, our current practices&mdash;from the leading of the elders to the messages of the co-workers to the activities of the saints&mdash;involve an exercise according to preconceived notions. There is not a spontaneous expression from our spirit. A spontaneous expression from our spirit depends upon the saints&rsquo; living in the spirit before and during the meeting. When everything comes out of the spirit, there is no need for considerations from our mind. Whatever comes out of our mental consideration is fundamentally different from that which comes out of the spirit. At least ninety percent of our living and meetings reflects our mental considerations rather than our spontaneous living in the spirit.</p>
<p>For example, when some brothers are asked to give a message, they write down the content of their speaking, point by point from beginning to end. Then they speak these points in exact order from the podium. Such a speaking is reasonable, but often it is wholly doctrinal. Other brothers follow the spirit in their speaking, even though they have considered what to speak in advance. This kind of speaking is spontaneous and from the spirit.</p>
<p>In the same way, some consider the content of their prayer, and when they pray, it seems as if the content has been prepared in advance. Others who have some prior consideration are willing to drop their original intention after praying a few sentences and to release their spirit according to the leading of the living Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR CHRISTIAN LIVING AND MEETINGS<br />
TO BE ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, the Lord wants our living and our meetings to be spontaneous and according to the spirit. In our Christian living we should not live according to our mind but according to the release of our spirit. If we consider how to live according to the spirit and how to release our spirit, whatever comes out will only be according to our mind, that is, according to the realm of right and wrong. Living according to our spirit is different, because such a living is the actual living of the Lord in us. Everything depends on following our spirit and releasing our spirit, not on the consideration of our mind or the feeling of our emotions. When the spirit rejoices, we should rejoice, and when the spirit does not rejoice, we should not rejoice. When the spirit praises, we should praise, and when the spirit does not praise, we should not praise. The release of our spirit should not be based on human considerations.</p>
