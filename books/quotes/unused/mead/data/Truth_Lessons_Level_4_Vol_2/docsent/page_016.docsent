   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING BENJAMIN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Benjamin was born, his mother named him Ben-oni 35:18 , which means son of my affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But his father changed his name to Benjamin, which means son of the right hand and signifies the ascended and exalted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 49:27 says, Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, / In the morning devouring the prey / And in the evening dividing the spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Hebrew, the word translated as ravenous means tearing, that is, to tear into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Benjamin, as a tearing wolf, is also a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ascended and exalted Christ is not only the overcoming One but also the tearing One, the One who eats His enemy.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>JACOB S PROPHECIES</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As Jacob was dying, he prophesied concerning his twelve sons vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jacob did not prophesy by saying, Thus saith the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, he prophesied by being one with God to speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever Jacob spoke became God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jacob was God s mouthpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fact that Jacob could prophesy in such a way is a strong sign and manifestation that he was matured in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God honored and fulfilled the prophetic blessing pronounced by Jacob upon his twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Genesis 49 contains the essence of the entire Bible, and it is a summary of the history of Jacob s twelve sons, the history of Israel, the history of the church, and the individual spiritual history of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although this chapter is poetic and profound, it is rather brief.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the Israelites entered the good land, the tribe of Dan brought in an idol and became one with God s enemy, becoming a serpent in the way, a viper on the path, and bringing in a stumbling block to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, they should have been terminated as a tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, Jacob, not wanting to see one of his sons cut off, blessed him prophetically out of a loving heart by saying that Dan would still be a tribe judging his people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although his name was omitted in the record in 1 Chronicles and Revelation, Dan will still be a tribe in the millennium because of his father s blessing.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The combined blessings bestowed upon Joseph were of ten aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, he was blessed with the choicest things of heaven; second, he was blessed with the dew; third, he was blessed with the blessing of the deep that lies beneath; fourth, he was blessed with the choicest of the crops of the sun; fifth, he was blessed with the choicest of the yield of the moons; sixth, he was blessed with receiving the top of the ancient mountains; seventh, he was blessed with the choicest things of the eternal hills; eighth, he was blessed with the choicest things of the earth and its fullness; ninth, he was blessed with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb, which relate to life; tenth, he was blessed with the favor of Him who dwelt in the thornbush.</S>
