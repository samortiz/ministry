   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD NOT WANTING US TO BE LEADERS There Being No Leader among the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many portions in the New Testament that show that the Lord does not want anyone to be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In modern society every group has a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, among five members of a board of directors for a school, a president must be elected, or at least a convener must be chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament, however, the Lord Jesus appointed twelve apostles, but He did not appoint a chief apostle among them, nor did they elect a leader among themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There Being No Leaders in the Small Groups</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the book of Acts the disciples were greatly multiplied in number.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There were Jews who spoke Greek and Jews who spoke Hebrew, and the two groups could not communicate with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result, the daily dispensing was not done equally, and there were complaints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the twelve said, It is not fitting for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But brothers, look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word 6:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Seven disciples were chosen to serve food, but no leader was chosen among them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the New Testament Paul speaks of appointing elders and of their qualifications, but he does not speak of electing a leader among the elders Titus 1:5; 1 Tim 3:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Based on these examples, we do not have leaders in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a brother says that he has been in the church life for more than twenty years, loves the Lord, and never misses a meeting but complains when another brother, who has been saved for only five years, is appointed as a leading one, his concept of position will become a source of stumbling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The desire to be a leader is a poison that only damages the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THERE BEING NO DISTINCTION OF LEVEL</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AMONG THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among the co-workers and elders there are always some that are more spiritual and more experienced, who make decisions cf.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 15:13-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, this does not mean that such brothers are the head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During the early period of the church, Peter took the lead and James followed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, in Galatians 2 James was placed before Peter and John v. 9 . Later, James brought Judaism into the church, and this caused God to destroy the church in Jerusalem; even the entire city of Jerusalem was wiped out and totally destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These examples show that taking the lead is not the permanent responsibility of one person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the New Testament no elder has a head position over other elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the elders are on the same level and have the same rank.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no distinction of levels.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The saints should not have to report every matter that needs a decision to the elders, nor do the elders in a meeting hall report to the elders in the central meeting hall for approval.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, the elders should fellowship among themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, the brothers in a meeting hall cannot say that baptism by immersion is too troublesome, and they will therefore baptize by sprinkling, because they do not have the authority to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no such constitution among us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Any person who would do such a thing would be writing his own constitution and is not under this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Any change that is related to the truth must be based on the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether to baptize people in the morning or evening, whether to use a big tub or a small tub, or whether to use cold water or warm water do not need to be reported to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such decisions should be made according to the practical situation in a hall.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a matter cannot be worked out in a meeting hall, whether it is related to the work, the gospel in schools, the children s gospel, or the community gospel, I am open to fellowship with you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are no levels in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For a matter that will affect all twenty-one meeting halls, any meeting hall can call an elders meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no convener among us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as a matter concerns the whole church, any elder can call an elders meeting, and the elders in the twenty-one meeting halls should come and fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We hope that we can be exercised not to have a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Leaders do not exist in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we remove the leaders, there will be no levels among us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The deacons should not regard the elders as their boss.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the teaching of the Bible, the elders are appointed by God and so are the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the past our view concerning this point was not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Elders and Deacons Both Having Responsibilities</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps the brothers and sisters would ask how to practically carry out this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The elders have their responsibilities and so do the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The responsibilities of the elders are not under those of the deacons, nor are the responsibilities of the deacons under those of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the Bible, the elders should take care of shepherding and overseeing, and the deacons take care of various affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, the matters related to cleaning are carried out by the deacons and do not need to be reported to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once a matter related to cleaning requires an elder s approval, levels are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In our study of the Bible for the past years, we have found neither leaders nor levels in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the New Testament there is only fellowship and coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the elders decide on what needs to be done for a conference, including set-up, cleaning, and ushering, they often assign subordinates to carry out each task.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This way of doing things is according to the way of the world, not according to the teaching of the Bible.</S>
