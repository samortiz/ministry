   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ANNULLING OF CULTURAL DISTINCTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Colossians speaks of two kinds of peoples barbarians and Scythians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two names have posed a problem to Bible scholars.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In English a barbarian means a savage, an uncivilized person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But what is a Scythian?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This word comes from the Greek word Zema, which became Zecotha, then Zecothia, and then Zecothian.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mr. Wescott said that Zecothia was the name of a place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In ancient Greek literature, Zecothians and Galatians were often mentioned together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the Zecothians were a respectable people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Like the names of many cities, the word Zecothians brings a certain image to mind as soon as it is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, when Shansi is mentioned, one thinks of those who deal with money because most of the people from Shansi are businessmen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Shao-Shing is mentioned, one thinks of court secretaries during the Ching dynasty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The name of a place often conjures up associated images.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you consult Greek literature, you will see that the Scythians were a respected people, while the barbarians were a despised people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a matter of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Culture creates a big distinction in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you put a typical English gentleman beside an African native, the difference in culture will become very obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, Paul tells us that barbarian and Scythian alike must abolish all distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This cultural distinction has brought in frustration for many people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once I met two Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because I knew both of them quite well, I asked them frankly, Why do so many people in the world hate Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One said, Our Jewish culture does not conform to the standard of others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That was the first time I heard such an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I did not understand what he meant.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He went on to explain, Consider the case of an American Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Honestly speaking, if I were a non-Jewish American, I would not like American Jews either.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would despise the Jewish culture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If an American earns two hundred dollars a month, he spends a certain portion of it on food and rent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He polishes his shoes and changes his shirt daily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once every two months he buys a pair of new shoes and keeps his house neat and clean.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is happy if he has ten dollars left in his pocket at the end of the month.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the Jews are different.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A Jew who makes the same amount of money spends only ten dollars a month and saves the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He calculates how much he can save if he does not polish his shoes or buy new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He can tolerate a dirty shirt to save on soap.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unlike the American who is so particular about his creature comfort, the Jew is not particular about food or lodging.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All he wants is an ever-growing savings account in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We Jews look down on Americans because they are so poor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Americans look down on us because they think we do not care for personal grooming and living conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He went on to say, We Jews are good at making money.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are good with our brains but not with fashion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot get along too well with others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why no one likes us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That was the first time I heard such an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is difficult for a person with a polished culture to see eye to eye with one who has a seemingly unpolished culture.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a matter not of class, intellect, or financial status, but of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From a Scythian s point of view, nothing about a barbarian is right.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A barbarian is wrong in the way he dresses, eats, and lives.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From a barbarian s point of view, a Scythian is too hedonistic.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is too particular about food and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These two persons have two totally different perspectives.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If both of them come to the church, each will bring his own opinion along and consider the other wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When they come together, there is bound to be a clash.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They can never be one with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Chinese eat with chopsticks, while the Indians eat with their fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Put them together at the same table for a few meals and both will feel uneasy at heart.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They may not say much.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But leave them together for two days and they will not be able to stand each other; they will start to quarrel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One may feel that chopsticks should be used because it is unsightly to eat with one s fingers, and the other may feel that eating with chopsticks is merely for show and that one can truly enjoy his meal when he eats with his fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One will say that the other is wrong and vice versa.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a difference in culture.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Such cultural differences present a real barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But even this is abolished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who are in Christ should be the most accommodating persons.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They can tolerate all kinds of human differences.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A man in Christ does not set up a standard and demand that everyone else to come up to his standard.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He does not respect only those who come up to his standard and despise those who do not.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not how a person in Christ should behave.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This kind of behavior does not belong in the church or in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Suppose some brothers among us come from India or Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Their cultures are different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But we should ask only one question: Are they in the Lord or not?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They should ask us the same question: Are we in the Lord or not?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are in Christ, all problems will be settled immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we contact each other in Christ and love one another in Christ, there is nothing that cannot be tolerated.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should not allow anything to come between God s children, to differentiate the brothers and sisters in Christ from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We cannot group the sophisticated brothers and sisters together to form a church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We cannot group the unsophisticated ones together to form another church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>That would not be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Such things are not in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They belong outside the church, outside the Body, and outside the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must never bring such problems into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All cultural differences have been abolished in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>However, we must learn to live as Romans among Romans and be under the law among those who are under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whatever kind of culture we are in, we do as others do.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If some African brothers come to China, and they have the knowledge of God, they should use chopsticks.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we go to Africa, we may have to eat with our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We do not want to come into conflict with the local brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When we go to them, we must learn to live among them.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When they come to us, they must learn to live among us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When we go to England, we must learn to behave like the Englishmen, and when an Englishman comes to China, he must learn to behave like the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we do not do this, we will stumble others, and they will not be won to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If God s children have a good start in this matter, they will avoid much trouble later on.</S>
