   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Trained by Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was a trainee in Watchman Nee's first training on Kuling Mountain, Foochow, in 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I attended his training for nearly four months and was greatly helped by him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On one occasion, after I gave a testimony, he made the following comments:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Chang, you said that in spiritual matters you frequently felt flat and often felt dry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I hope that from now on you will disregard all these feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether or not you feel flat, disregard it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Simply commit yourself into the Lord's hand and believe that He is able to take care of you, and spontaneously He will bring you through.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are many problems we cannot overcome by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, when we behold the Lord and draw near to the Lord, the problem disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The following is a parable about a centipede.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One day, as a centipede was about to walk, it examined its legs to consider which one should move first.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Should the left leg move first or the right one?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How about the eighth leg, or the tenth?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The centipede was stuck there trying to make a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The problem of the mind became a problem of the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, the sun came up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without thinking, the centipede ran out to see the sunrise without considering which leg should move first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It forgot about how to walk and simply walked.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the problem of the mind was gone, the problem of the practice also disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more you try to deal with the inner dryness, depression, and flatness, the more you cannot overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These things become an issue because you make them an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you forget about them and let them go, they will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes a problem is conquered by fighting, and other times it is conquered by forgetting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many things can be gotten over by the exercise of your strength.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But at other times, simply by forgetting it, the problem is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Boast in your weakness and give up your striving and your methods; then His power will spread over you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the secret: Ask God to give you a glimpse of His riches and His glory through reading the Bible, praying, attending a meeting, or having fellowship with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Spontaneously, you will forget about other things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The infilling comes by forgetting, and forgetting comes by touching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once you touch the Lord, you will no longer look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Following his comments on my testimony, I asked him the following question: "I was sick for a year with tuberculosis, even with blood in my mucus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day God's word came, I received faith, and the sickness was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But occasionally I would vomit again and the symptom would reappear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why does the symptom reappear, and how do I overcome it?"</S>
