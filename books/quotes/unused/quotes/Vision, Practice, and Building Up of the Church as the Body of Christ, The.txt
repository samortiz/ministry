In Eve we see only the origin of the church, but the Shulammite as the counterpart of Solomon is a type of the church in a full way
Almost all the items revealed concerning God's eternal plan for the church are in two books-Ephesians and Colossians
If we are going to know Ephesians, we must know Colossians, and if we are going to know Colossians, we must know Ephesians
When we put all these words together-stewardship, dispensation, arrangement, administration-we have an economy
It means that God made an arrangement and an administration to do something, which is to dispense Himself to man
We may have the thought that the church is merely a gathering of people who were fallen and now are saved and come together to worship God
If we would look from the heavens and into eternity, we will see that the church is higher than the traditional Christian thought about it
That is why Ephesians 1:10 mentions God's economy concerning the church, and 3:11 speaks of the eternal purpose which God made
Verse 5 says, 'Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
All these sons have the life of God and inherit all that He is, all that He has, all that He planned, and all that He accomplished
In this sense, God's intention for the church is to multiply and reproduce Himself, to have a mass reproduction of Himself
He has been born again, but after someone is born again, there is a possibility that he will fall away from the grace of God
Verses 16 and 17 continue, 'Lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one meal gave up his own birthright
All that God Himself is, all that He has, and all that He has planned and will accomplish together are the inheritance
Every part of verse 5 is important, including predestinated, unto sonship, through Jesus Christ,and to Himself
Ephesians 1:4 says, 'Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love'
We have to be mingled and overlaid with God in His holy and divine nature , just as the items in the tabernacle were overlaid with gold
To be without blemish also means that we are fully corresponding to what God desires, that we satisfy God's desire in a full way
The New Jerusalem will be the real sonship, the real holiness, and that which is truly without blemish before God
Through the church God's manifold wisdom is made known to the rulers and authorities, and the enemy is subdued
One day in the New Jerusalem we will see those brothers, and we will marvel at what kind of wonderful persons they have become
If we have the capital and the power but not the wisdom to run the corporation in the right way, the corporation will become bankrupt
In the two books of Ephesians and Colossians we can see these three matters for God's economy, His administration and 'corporation'
The fullness of God, that is God Himself with all that He is, is the very capital, the finance, of His economy
God's economy, His corporation, is carried out by God Himself as the capital, God's divine power, and God's divine wisdom as the way
Verse 20 says, 'For the creation was made subject to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it'
All creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God because the creation was made subject to vanity
An ugly caterpillar does not simply sleep well, have a good dream, and wake up the next morning transformed into a beautiful butterfly
On many occasions in the past, people have asked me, 'If God loves the people on the earth, why are there so many afflictions'?
If we ask a sister what she is doing in the kitchen, she will say, 'Please sit there patiently and wait for half an hour
The cooking sister has her economy, her dispensation, and the end of the half hour will be the 'fullness of the times' for her economy
After the cooking, however, when the fullness of the times comes, we will see the many beautiful courses of the feast
The preaching in Christianity tells people, 'We are poor, sinful persons who will perish, so we need God's mercy and grace
God is working Himself into us and mingling Himself with us so that we may be holy, absolutely sanctified by Him, in Him, and with Him
In the fulfillment of the type, God mingles Himself with the church so that we may be brought into full sonship
According to the teaching of the New Testament, sonship first means that we are born of God to have God as our life and nature
By being mingled with Him we are absolutely thoroughly sanctified by Him with Him and in Him within and without we are made holy and divine
The second aspect of God's purpose is to subdue and defeat His enemy by displaying His multifarious wisdom through the church
Although this aspect of the church in God's economy is revealed in the Word of God, many Christians have not seen it
Economy, or dispensation, and the fullness of the times are difficult phrases to understand and may seem strange to us
If all things are put under His headship, then all things are headed up; that is, they are gathered together into one
Because they have no light, they even consider their kind of confusion to be glorious; those who bring in more confusion become more famous
When we are filled with Christ, we are full of life, and we are wholly under the light; then we have harmony and oneness
If the brothers who live together are not filled with Christ as life, at least to some extent they will be under darkness and in confusion
In redemption, however, God recovers everything not by His hand and power but by Himself as life coming into us
In this life we will have light, and under this light spontaneously every one of us will be controlled and will be one
We will not know how to be filled with Christ, live by Him, take Him as our life, experience Him, and be dealt with by the cross
The New Jerusalem is composed with many members, represented by the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles , but they all are one
All the nations, representing all of creation, will be controlled by the shining of the city; therefore, all nations will have order
If all the lights in the stores and on the street were turned off, there would be robberies under darkness every night
God will shine on all creation through this universal lampstand and by this shining this enlightening God will bring all things into order
Within the city there is life, and this life is the very God who is ministered and imparted to all His members
He needs to work Himself into you, me, and every one of us as life, that we may be full of light and be controlled by this light
All the nations will be brought into this shining, and they will walk in this light and be controlled by this light
Creation will be completely released from the slavery of corruption and will be brought into the freedom of the glory of the holy city
All creation will be brought back, released from all bondage, and brought into the freedom of the glory of the sons of God
In studying the book of Ephesians, the verses cited above are the most difficult verses for people to understand
The sonship, God's wisdom made known, and the heading up of all things are the three main items of God's purpose concerning the church
The way for God to work Himself into us and thoroughly mingle with us is by being our life and our life supply
Our human spirit is the base of the divine work of the Triune God; it is the abode that God first takes within us
From the very center of our beingour spirit as the base for Gods workGod spreads Himself to our soul to transform all the parts of the soul
In an all-inclusive sense, sanctification includes regeneration in the spirit, transformation for the soul, and transfiguration of the body
The end of this sanctification is glorification, and glorification is the manifestation of the children of God
Included in this complete sanctification we have glorification, and with this glorification we have the manifestation of the sons of God
When we have the full sonship, whatever God is, whatever God has, and whatever God has accomplished will be ours
Sonship includes our becoming a child of God by the new birth all the way to the manifestation of the sons of God
Between these two points there is a process, and the main part of the process is a mess in which the cook kills, cuts, scrapes, and mashes
We may also compare this process to cutting hair, which requires a number of instruments and also seems to make a mess
One day, sooner or later, He will have the full sonship among His children, and He will have their manifestation in glory
By the new birth we have the image of God within our spirit, and by transformation our soul will be conformed to the image of Christ
God's creation of man was first for man to be in His image and second to have His authority to deal with His enemy
At present, as regards the sonship, we are under a process, and as regards the subduing of the enemy, we are in a battle
We need the vision of how much the Lord will use the church to defeat His enemy and to subdue and recover the whole earth
The church must have the sonship, Satan must be subdued and cast out, and the whole creation must be headed up
These three main items-one for the church, one for the enemy, and one for the whole creation-are truly great matters
All the things in God's creation were right, but the enemy of God came in and injected himself into the creation
Death, darkness, and confusion came in, and the whole of creation was brought into vanity under the slavery of corruption
Satan injected himself into creation, bringing in death, darkness, and confusion, but now God has imparted Himself into us as life
From Him flows the river of life with the tree of life to supply all His sons, and the redeemed ones as the sons of God are filled with life
The whole city shines out this life as light, and the nations, representing the whole universe, walk in the light of this city
At that time the entire universe will be in a good harmony, and there will be no more death, thus no more darkness and no more confusion
All the surrounding nations, representing the entire universe, walk in this light and are controlled under this light
At this time the sonship will be fully fulfilled, the enemy will be cast out, and all things will be headed up in Christ through the Body
As we saw in the previous messages, God's purpose concerning the church is revealed in three portions in Ephesians
We were predestinated unto sonship so that we may have God as our life, grow in this life, and have the full birthright in this life
If we have the growth in life, we have transformation, and at the Lord's coming back He will give us the reward, which is the birthright
When we meet a spiritual person who is transformed in his soul, we can realize that his mind, emotion, and will have been uplifted
Many things are related to the birthright, including the priesthood, the kingship, and the inheritance of a double portion of the good land
As the firstborn son of Jacob, Reuben should have had the birthright, but due to his sin, he lost his birthright
Revelation 1:6 and 5:10 tell us that we are saved as kings and priests, and Hebrews 2:5-6 tells us that one day we will inherit the earth
Those who have the divine birth but do not grow in life will lose the birthright at that time, because they will not be mature
After the thousand years they will be fully grown, and in the new heaven and new earth they will enjoy the birthright
That will be too late to enjoy the birthright in the millennium, but it will not be too late to enjoy the birthright in eternity
If the Lord were to return today and say to you, 'Come, be a king in My kingdom,' you may say, 'Lord, You have come to the wrong person
As we have said, Jacob received the birthright, but he did not enjoy the birthright due to his lack of maturity
Later when he went down to see Pharaoh, he had matured, so spontaneously he was a king; he was Israel, the prince of God
According to the sixty-six books of the Bible, the ultimate conclusion and goal of God's intention is a building
The brothers in the Far East, even today, have been much opposed and criticized simply because we stand for the church, the building
If we would drop the matter of the church and merely preach the gospel and help people to be spiritual, everyone will praise us
Regardless of how much we are criticized, if we are faithful to stand with God, we will be a blessing even to those who criticize us
They will receive all the teachings and all the blessings that we minister, and they will help others with them
Another aspect of God's purpose concerning the church is seen in Ephesians 1:10: 'To head up all things in Christ'
God created the heavens and the earth as the universe, and within this sphere or realm He created millions of creatures
Sin here is personified; it is something living because it can dwell, have dominion, and reign as a king over us
Light brings in regulation, and under this regulation we have order, which is the building up under the headship of Christ
From the Triune God as life, the light shines, and under this shining light all things are brought into order under the headship of Christ
There will be no more clay or anything opaque, because every piece of clay will have been transformed into precious stone
Christ as the Head to head up all things in Himself is the ultimate consummation of the sixty-six books of the Bible
We must have the real experience of the sonship, which is the experience of life, and we must realize the headship of Christ
The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number four signifies man as the leading one of all the creatures
Brother Nee pointed out that these four women are actually one woman, signifying God's redeemed people composed together
Concerning the last woman, Brother Nee said, 'In the New Jerusalem, the union of God and man is no longer seven, but twelve
We need to experience the Lord as life in the way of food to be digested by us, thus becoming our very constituent
In Genesis 2 there is the tree of life, and there is also the building implied by the precious materials of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone
At the end of the Bible, in Revelation 21 and 22, there is again the tree of life and the building with precious materials
On the other hand, the treasure hidden in the earth and the pearl of great value are the precious materials for the building
Similarly, 1 Corinthians 3 tells us that, on the one hand, we are God's cultivated land, and on the other hand, we are the house of God
The second category of the types of the church is the house of God, the tabernacle, the temple, and even the city
Although Christians today pay some amount of attention to the growth, they mostly neglect the matter of building
In the Body the joints are the members of supply, the members of nourishment that supply nourishment to other members
The verses mentioned above speak of four categories: the Head, the joints, the sinews, and all the other parts
Besides the Head the joints and the sinews there are the many parts the many members who are neither the Head the joints nor the sinews
The eyes, ears, nose, and hands are not joints or sinews, but they are parts of the body that have their operation
The church, the Body, is built up directly by the saints who are perfected through the ministry of the gifted persons
If we are joints, we must do our duty to supply and to nourish, and if we are sinews, we must be faithful to join the Body together in love
Many times the members need the supply, but after they are supplied, they need someone to join, knit, and bind them together
Rather, Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 tell us that the Body has many members, and all the members do not have the same function
He always realizes what and who he is, so he prepares a meal in his home and invites people, but he does not try to speak to them
If one person is a mouth but he cannot prepare a meal in his home, he needs the cooperation of the Body in order to preach the gospel
If by the Lord's mercy we know what we are and where we are, and we remain there, this will be a great help for the building up of the Body
There is no doubt that we all have the sincere desire to build up the church, but to do this we must keep the proper order
God wants to work Himself into us to make us not only His sons but also His heirs to inherit all that He is and all He has
Through this life and under the headship of Christ, all things will be headed up by Christ the Head through the church
The third item of Gods purpose is that in life the church will be built up so that Satan the enemy of God will be defeated and put to shame
It is God's purpose that through the church He would manifest Himself through His Son, Christ, and put His enemy to shame
To be born of the Father means that whatever the Father is and whatever the Father has is imparted into His sons
By creating us, He made us to exist, and by begetting us, He imparted Himself into us as our life and everything
By this spreading God permeates and saturates all our inward parts, our whole heart-our conscience, mind, emotion, and will
Now by His spreading from our spirit throughout our whole being we have the growth of life and eventually the maturity the fullness of life
Christ is the Head and by being life to us He saturates transforms and transfigures us to bring us into the proper order under His headship
For the purpose that humans may exist, God prepared many material, physical things for them, such as food and drink
God revealed His law and His will to them with the intention that the Scriptures would help them to know God, God's plan, and God's Christ
The four Gospels clearly show how the Jewish scribes, elders, Pharisees, and learned ones were very distracted from Christ by the Scriptures
Christians have not merely the material things created by God and the Old Testament revelation of God but also the New Testament
Similarly, the Jews today have the Old Testament in their synagogues, but not for God's purpose since they are fully distracted from Christ
The Scriptures knowledge teachings gifts manifestations operations functions and ministries are all for the central mark of Gods economy
Eventually we are filled, not with material things or even with knowledge, gifts, or power, but unto all the fullness of God
We are no more carried away by every wind of teaching, even good teaching, but we grow up into Christ in all things
Although some Christians realize that Ephesians is about the church, many still neglect the key to the building up of the church
The soul itself is a composition of the mind, emotion, and will, and of these three parts the mind is the strongest
When we turn our mind to the Lord, our conscience shows us how we are wrong with the Lord, so we need to confess
Through our repenting and confessing, the two main parts of our heart-our mind and our conscience-spontaneously are opened
When the gateway is opened, the spirit is free, so the Lord is able to strengthen our spirit and spread into our heart
When our mind is set on other things, our conscience is hardened, our emotions are not for Him, and Christ is imprisoned in our spirit
We are able to apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth not by ourselves individually but corporately and jointly
Finally, verse 19 says, 'And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God'
We are not being filled with material things scriptural knowledge or the socalled spiritual gifts but unto all the fullness of God Himself
The riches of Christ and His immeasurable dimensions include so much that we would need many days to explain even a little of our experience
Rather, He builds up the church through the gifted persons-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
The gifted persons-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers-do not minister gifts to people
If you read Ephesians 3 and 4 again, kneeling before the Lord and praying, the Lord will give you a vision of these things
The more knowledge we have, the more divisions we will have, and the more gifts we have, the more fighting we will have
Ephesians is the book that deals specifically with the church life, and the central portion of Ephesians is chapters 3 and 4
We grow up into Christ in all things and receive something from the Head which we minister to others in order to be built up together
After unveiling the vision of the church, he realized that this is not merely a matter to be understood, a matter in the mentality
The main point of this prayer is that our inner man must be strengthened so that Christ may make His home not in our spirit but in our heart
The New Testament clearly reveals that we may be fully regenerated in our spirit yet still be soulish, natural, and darkened in the soul
When we exercise our mind to turn to the Lord, our conscience follows, and we confess according to what the conscience perceives
On many occasions when we try to point out these things to people, their thoughts are distracted right at the crucial moment
When our mind and conscience are open to the Lord, the gateway is open to Him, and He has the free way to fill us
The Lord comes, not from without but from within, to spread Himself in us to saturate all the parts of our soul
When we open ourselves to the Lord, He comes in to fill us, spreading from our spirit within into all the parts of the soul
There is no doubt that we have Christ in our spirit, but there is much doubt as to whether Christ has any place in our soul
Before Brother Nee returned to the public ministry after the war, he had a number of times of fellowship with a few brothers
When the brothers and sisters come together to talk, they are very strong, but when we ask them to pray, they are weak
If the brothers and sisters are talking and someone says Let us be silent they will not stop talking even after being asked several times
If Christ is imprisoned by the soulish life in you, and He is imprisoned by the soulish life in me, how can we have the church life?
We are brothers, and we are the members of the Body, but all these members are covered and concealed with a layer of soulish 'wax'
If we could have taken away the gold and left only the forty-eight boards, they would immediately have fallen apart
It is in this divinity, in the Triune God as the overlaying divine gold, that we are covered and joined together
Our inner man must be strengthened, and our soul must be subdued, renewed, taken over, occupied, and possessed by the indwelling Christ
Today we hear many voices speaking in different ways about the church, but many people have forgotten Ephesians 4
In the short passage from verse 1 to verse 16, the apostle under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit wrote something very profound
In order to practice the church life, we must realize all the main aspects, the main points, concerning the church in Ephesians 4
Whenever we talk about the practice of the church life, we must remember that the first thing needed is to keep the oneness of the Spirit
The third stanza of the traditional hymn 'Onward Christian Soldiers' says, 'One in hope and doctrine, one in charity'
If someone has a certain understanding about a particular portion of the Bible, he may hold to that portion without caring for the oneness
Many Christians insist on baptism by sprinkling, some insist on a single immersion, and some insist on three immersions
It may seem that he is one with others, but there is still something within him that divides and keeps him from others
On the one hand, we all are one in the Spirit, in the Triune God, in the saving faith, and in all the matters in verses 4 through 6
There are the apostles' ministry, the prophets' ministry, the evangelists' ministry, and the ministry of the shepherds and teachers
A great teacher may live and work only for his teaching and not for the Body, and eventually a division may come out of his teaching
If many of us go out to work for the Lord, some may be more evangelical, but others will care more for teaching
He must keep his own hand away from the result of his preaching and let the fruits of his preaching be for the building up of the church
Regardless of how much we help people by our teaching, we should not keep the result of our teaching in our hand
It is a shame to say that even among us there is a secret trend of certain gifted persons keeping the result of their work in their hand
The reason there is nearly no real practice of the church life today is simply that people are not clear about these points
The Head builds the church through the gifted persons-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Verse 12 tells us that all these gifted persons are not for the building up of the church directly but are for the perfecting of the saints
All the leading ones in the meeting must be careful about the way they act, not giving people the impression that they are taking the lead
On one side, the leading ones may carelessly act in a way that gives people the impression that they are taking the lead
The first brother fights for the Southern Baptist way, the second for the Presbyterian way, and the third for the Methodist way
The more they receive the proper help and grow, the more they will be able to drop the things they picked up after they were saved
We need to drop the mere doctrines and love the Lord, contact Him, testify for Him, and live in the spirit with Him
We must testify to the principalities and powers in the heavenlies that we are here for nothing but Christ and His Body
We read the Word not for the understanding of doctrines but to partake of the life in Christ through the spirit
Whenever someone is speaking mere doctrines, we should pray, look to the Lord, and tell him, 'Let us come back to Christ
Verse 15 continues, 'But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ'
That we need to grow up into Christ in all things indicates that in some things we have not yet grown up into Him
The Body builds itself up not directly by the gifted persons but by all the different parts, the different members
Even today some say that the church will be built up only in the heavens, that this cannot be accomplished on the earth in this age
Wait and see-if not the whole Body, at least a small number, a remnant, a part of the Body, will be recovered for the building up
In order to practice the church life, we must not neglect any of the matters we have fellowshipped in this message
If we are not clear about these points or if we do not practice them, we are still not in the proper practice of the church life
We must realize that while the first section of this book is the section of vision, the second section is a matter of practice
We ourselves may be clear about these things now, but when some go to start the church life in other places, they may lose their direction
The ministering Spirit already knows that they do not understand, and the ministering Spirit also realizes when there is opposition
The mystery of the faith is the very mystery of godliness, which is the Triune God manifested in the corporate Body
Faith is for being identified and joined with the Triune God, and baptism is to separate us from the old creation
Faith brings us into an identification with the Triune God, and baptism separates us from the old relationships in the old creation
We are the Body, and we hope for nothing but the Lord's coming, in which our physical body will be transfigured into a glorious body
If we do not say this, however, what should we do with Isaiah 9:6, which tells us that a Son is given, but His name is called Eternal Father
Speaking in tongues is not among the seven ones, and particular truths concerning the Trinity are also not clearly stated in the seven ones
Unless something is actually sinful, we can go along with it, because all these items are not touched by the seven ones
We know that baptism by immersion is proper, for example, but if someone insists on baptizing by sprinkling, we will not fight with him
As the representative of man, He received gifts from God, even the rebellious ones, so that Jehovah God may dwell among men
The reason that many sects divisions and denominations have come into existence is that the gifted persons were not clear about this purpose
Some gifted ones may argue and say, 'We too are building up the church, not the local churches but the universal church'
To build up the church is to build up the church in Ephesus the church in Smyrna the church in Thyatira or the church in some other locality
If we pay our attention to work for the local churches, not our own ministry, then all divisions will disappear
We must consider the church to be a family with persons of every kind-old ones, young ones, babyish ones, stronger ones, and weaker ones
There is much practice and learning in that place and that the brother working there knows how to raise up and perfect the saints
After five years he will have the peace to leave that place, because a local church will have been built up there
Co-workers are raised up, elders are built up, and deacons and deaconesses are produced because the work is carried out in the proper way
The more we work the more the work must be passed on to the saints and the more the responsibility must be in the hands of the local saints
Even if he is raptured, the church still can go on, even in a better way, because the local saints will improve it
Eventually a local church must be built up under the hands of all those persons who have been perfected by the gifted ones
He raised up, perfected, and trained the saints to be the elders, deacons, and deaconesses in different places
In certain large local churches in Taiwan, twenty to fifty co-workers were produced after only five or six years
If you go there you will realize that these are genuine proper elders not in position or name but in reality and in bearing responsibility
In other places, however, even after fifty years it is still difficult to find a co-worker who was produced there
The only problem is that the co-worker there took the wrong way, working all the time without perfecting others
It is not right for us simply to meet together and fellowship without anyone being raised up by the Lord to go out for Him
After a certain time there must be some who would be willing to sacrifice everything for the Lord to go out to other countries
We cannot work it out ourselves, but if we coordinate and cooperate with the Lord, He will work this out through us
If our inner motive for working in a certain place is to build up something for our own desire or purpose, it is not pure
On the one hand, we are working, while on the other hand, we are perfecting others by our working, not simply doing things by ourselves
The fourth and fifth points in Ephesians 4 are growth and holding to truth, that is, holding Christ as the reality
The two sister books of Ephesians and Colossians deal with the universal man, Colossians with the Head and Ephesians with the Body
Verse 15 of chapter 4 says, 'Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ'
In the whole of Christianity today we can hear almost no messages telling us that our function depends on the growth of life
The apostle Paul learned how to plant, how to water, and how to help people to grow, and he also learned how to build
If we do not know how to carry out all the above matters, we can have no confidence that we are in the real and proper church life
These verses speak of the vanity of the mind, the darkening of the understanding, and the hardness, the blindness, of the heart
Verse 19 continues, 'Who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness'
Verses 20 and 21 say, 'But you did not so learn Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus'
Because this man is old, all his thoughts, ideas, concepts, desires, love, hatred, decisions, intentions, and motives must be put off
The apostle Paul had the experience, and he knew the spiritual things, so he could write this short book with many profound items
We need many messages to cover the matters of the mind, the understanding, the heart, and the conscience with its feeling
The elements of the old man are not only anything that is worldly and sinful but also anything old, natural, soulish, and fleshly
Ephesians 4:24 says, 'And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality'
According to the entire book of Ephesians, the new man is not merely an individual who has been regenerated and transformed
It is better to invent a new letter for our alphabet, a small s within a big S, for use in a passage such as this one
Our mind is cleared up from all vanity, our understanding is enlightened, our heart is open to the Lord, and our conscience cared for
Rather, in this book we have the growth and our function to receive something from the Head and impart it to others
Even in dealing with the miraculous gifts, there is much vanity of the mind and darkness and blindness in the understanding
The way to grow is by being renewed in the spirit that controls our mind and brings our whole being under its leadership and subduing
The church life must be a life of our being mingled with God in which our inner man, our spirit, is strengthened
It must be prevailing, having the first place, so that our entire being comes under the inner man and Christ has full control of it
The only way to be renewed is for the spirit to get into our mind to saturate, take over, possess, and occupy it
How much church life we have had depends on the degree to which we have been renewed in the spirit of our mind
If we have only a small amount of renewal in the spirit of our mind, we have only a small amount of church life
The rest of verse 29 says, 'But only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear'
His footnote for the phrase build up says, 'Literally, such as is good for needful building up , that it may give a blessing to the hearers'
Colossians 4:6 says, 'Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one'
Whenever we speak with the brothers and sisters in the church, we must take care of the present situation of the church
If a brother comes to talk with us we may realize that he has a certain problem with the church the sisters the elders or the young people
If we are in the spirit and under the control of the spirit, our spirit will have the anointing and the wisdom to speak with him
When the brother mentioned above comes to speak with us, he presents a need of the occasion in that he has a problem with the church
We may have felt that we should not speak in a certain way, but we still spoke in the way of causing damage to the building up of the church
We are not complaining against any persons; we are accusing the enemy, Satan, who is doing his best to frustrate the building
We must learn to speak, to communicate, with the saints in the spirit, under the control of the spirit, and under the anointing
The enemy likes to give a longer word, even for two or three hours, and we may have the inner desire to listen to it
On the other hand someone may read Revelation 21 in the morning and tell us that the New Jerusalem is wonderful but we may not be impressed
When our wife calls us to breakfast, we may say, 'Let's go eat,' but we may have no appetite to hear about the New Jerusalem
When we gossip about other things, people may not pay much attention, but whenever we gossip about the church, every ear is attentive
Our speech must be good to meet the need of the occasion for the building up of the church by ministering grace to the hearers
According to the grammar of this sentence, being filled in spirit is related to speaking, giving thanks, and being subject to one another
According to the context of these verses, if we do not speak, sing, and thank the Lord, we will never be subject to others
If he is wise, he will check to see whether or not she is happy and wait until her mouth is full of thanks and praises
It is by this washing that the church is sanctified and cleansed, and all the spots and the wrinkles are purged away
Spots are something of the natural life, and wrinkles are related to oldness, so not even the best soap can wash them away
It ministers life to us, and this life within is the washing water, sanctifying and cleansing us of all the spots and wrinkles
The only way out of this situation is to forget about our reasoning and turn from our natural mentality in the soul to the spirit
As long as we are in the mentality reasoning arguing and trying to convince others the Lords word will not be life to us when we read it
In this way the church will be sanctified and cleansed from all spots and wrinkles because all death will be swallowed up by life
It is by means of all prayer and petition in spirit, not by talking and reasoning, that the problems are solved
When the first three are burned out, the fire keeps burning with new material, and you yourself become the material to burn
If these five points were removed from the last three chapters of Ephesians, these chapters would be meaningless
These five points related to the spirit are vital to this portion of the Word, which speaks about the practice of the church life
If we are truly practicing the church life, we all need to learn the lesson of turning to the spirit, both by ourselves and with others
The more we stop our talking and forget our reasonings and our fallen mentality, the more we are full of praises
If we learn to turn from our mind to the spirit, everything will be cleared up, not through the mind but in the spirit
We must learn to be filled in spirit and to have praises, thanks, and subjection to one another from the infilling Spirit
All of the above are the key passages in the last part of the book of Ephesians, showing us the proper way to have the church life
It is the central point, the ultimate aim, of God's purpose according to all the visions and revelations in the Scriptures
The central item of that vision was Bethel, the house of God, built with two kinds of material, stone and the oil poured upon the stone
It is the oil the person of the Spirit in whom and by whom the very God comes into us to be one with us producing Bethel the house of God
The vision at Bethel is the seed of the vision, and the vision of the New Jerusalem is the harvest of the vision
After Moses, the next major vision was that of David, the vision of the temple as the enlargement of the tabernacle
According to Ezekiel 40 through 48, the temple that Ezekiel saw was a further enlargement of the temple seen by David
Zechariah's vision was related to the recovery of the temple, and Daniel's visions are related to the temple in the end times
It is surprising to hear Christians often speaking about visions, because many do not realize that all the visions are for the building
Some brothers have studied the Scriptures in seminaries and Bible institutes, but they may have never heard of the vision of God's building
With these visions we have the seed, the growth and enlargement, the recovery, and even the enlargement of the enlargement
Beginning in 1939, Brother Watchman Nee spent three years to stress one matter-our need to see the Body, which is the building of God
Before that time we may have known about the building of God but eventually the vision will be open to us and we will see it in our spirit
He was occupied by nothing other than the building of the dwelling place of God, not in heaven but on this earth and in his age
At the time of Solomon when the temple was first built, all of God's people were in the same place and on the same ground
Later, some of God's people were captured away to Egypt, some to Syria, and some to Persia, while most of them were taken away to Babylon
To identify with even the biggest group, the one in Babylon, was to not be identified with the rest of the people of God
Under the present dispersion, in the time of captivity, it is not a matter of choosing with whom we identify ourselves
What matters is that we receive the command of God to come back to the very place appointed and ordained by God
Those who came back to Jerusalem with Ezra and Nehemiah to stand on the proper ground of the temple became a living testimony
After the day of Pentecost there was no need for those in Jerusalem to take a standing with a particular people of God
All the believers were identified with one another simply because they were all in one place, standing on one ground
In the degradation, captivity, and dispersion today, it is not a matter of choosing with whom we identify ourselves
For this reason we need to see a vision and not simply consider the situation according to our natural and religious concept
The age today is a time for some overcomers to listen to the voice of the rejected Lord, the One who is outside the camp
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was always criticized by the religious people, by those who had the Scriptures in their hands
If someone considers that he is spiritual yet he is independent individualistic and isolated from the Body his spirituality is a deception
Someone may be very humble, but whether this humility is genuine and spiritual or false and natural can be tested only by the building
We felt that what we were doing was right, even according to the Word, but we have been damaging the building'
What God is seeking after today is not that we keep the requirements of the law but that we fulfill the requirements of the building
Even if we feel that we have not seen the vision, we should still put ourselves and specific things about us on the test of the building
It is difficult for someone to be truly related with others if, for example, he has secret, unconfessed sins and inner, hidden things
If we apply the building as the test, we will be fully and thoroughly revolutionized, and we will have a real turn
It is not only by our being cleansed to deal with the negative things but also by our being transformed positively in our entire being
Verse 11 says, 'And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers'
In addition, the people of Israel are also wheat to produce fine flour and cakes for the meal offering to satisfy God
The first group are the parables of the sower and the seed the wheat and tares the mustard seed with its growth and the flour and the leaven
The sower sowed the seed with the hope that wheat would grow , but the enemy came in to sow tares to frustrate the growth of the wheat
The purpose of a mustard herb is to feed people, but the purpose of a tree is to lodge the birds as the evil spirits
On the one hand, we are God's cultivated land to grow, and on the other hand, we are God's building to be built up
The line of growth and building go together throughout the entire Bible, from the very beginning to the very end
We have been redeemed by the redemption of God the Son, and now we are under the process of transformation by the work of God the Spirit
When we were first saved, Christ came as a small seed into the innermost part, our human spirit, but He did not yet fill our soul
There is no need to point out the impossibility of Chinese, Japanese, British, French, and Americans being built up together in the self
Even brothers of the same race from the same place cannot be built together, because each one has his own particular disposition
When Christ overcomes, conquers, defeats, and takes full possession of us, He can join Himself to the Christ in others
The more we have the victory over the Lord, the more we are separated, but the more He defeats us, the more He can build us together
She may have a nice soul with a nice mind a loving emotion and a very soft will but there may be only a small portion of Christ within her
Whoever chooses the most proper person as his or her spouse will constantly suffer due to the spouse's individualism
Not only do those with bad dispositions need to be conquered by Christ, but those with even the best dispositions must be conquered
When the other brother came into a home, he would take his own seat, not where the guests sit but at the owner's desk
As he drank the tea, he would spill some on the floor, and when he was finished, he would leave the cup carelessly
One brother felt that the other's disposition was a hindrance to the Lord, and each one justified his own disposition
One brother may like to go to bed early and rise early, but the brother he lives with may not rise until an hour later
In order to practice the church life, we need an enlightened human spirit, one that is full of wisdom and revelation
We will be able to see the spiritual and heavenly things not in the mind, in the soul, or even in the heart but in our spirit
Verse 22 of chapter 2 says, 'In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit'
Spirit here is the human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God
At that point the spirit subdues and possesses the mind, and the mind comes under the rule, the control, of the spirit
Our spirit must also be strengthened so that Christ may gain more ground to take possession of our whole being
After getting married, a husband must not only tell his dear wife where he is going, but he may also need to ask her permission
Whenever husbands and wives are not happy with each other, they are in the soul, either the mind or the emotions
When you look at my face from the front, you can see my eyes, but when you look from behind, you see only my hair
In the same principle, if a brother looks at his wife from the point of view of his mind, he will quickly become unhappy with her
Many times we have problems with the dear ones in the church life simply because we exercise our mind too much
We all have a heart for the Lord, we have seen the vision of the church, and we desire to practice the genuine church life
When we are in the spirit, even when there are problems in the church, we are not bothered and we do not get involved with them
We need to realize that if we are in the soul and not in the spirit, there is the danger that we may get involved with the problem
Originally the problem may have involved only two persons, but if we get involved in our soul, more people will be added to the problem
It is in this way that Satan, the subtle one, takes the ground to increase and enlarge the problems in the church
We should not exercise the mind or the emotion; we should simply contact the Lord in the spirit for a certain amount of time
The situation may not change, but our view will change, and with this view we will be kept away from negative involvement
If he turns back to the spirit and considers things from the spirit, he will pray at every time in spirit with all prayer and petition
Whenever there is a problem in the church with the brothers and sisters, we must practice to turn to the spirit
Rather, we will be related to a proper extent, because whenever we are in the spirit, there is always the proper restriction
If we do not have this balance in the spirit, we will eventually have divided and divisive parties among the brothers
One group of brothers will be overly related; another group will be related among themselves but not to the first group
Paul was a prisoner not merely in a physical prison, and he was not only imprisoned for the Lord; he was a prisoner in the Lord
According to 1:4-5 God predestinated us, He marked us out beforehand for His eternal purpose concerning the Body of Christ
The first item of the Christian walk that is worthy of God's calling is that we must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit
For this purpose we need to be diligent, and strive, struggle, and even fight to keep, maintain, and preserve the oneness
Now what we need today is not to receive or gain this oneness but to endeavor strive and struggle to keep maintain and preserve the oneness
According to my experience and learning in the past, these five items are a test to us in the practice of the church life
Some claim the cross as their standard, and others say that holiness, the inner life, or spirituality is their standard
To speak in tongues, to have healing, to preach the cross, to have the resurrection life, and to practice holiness are not wrong
Regardless of how good, heavenly, or spiritual something is, as long as it is something other than Christ Himself, it will cause division
In the church and among Christians we need to treat everyone in the same way, regardless of his or her spirituality
Whether or not someone is spiritual and whether or not he loves the Lord much, we must treat him as we do others
Rather, to love the weaker ones, the fleshly and soulish ones, and the ones with problems will solve most of their problems
If someone takes our Bible and does not return it, for example, it will be difficult to be meek in our attitude toward him
The next day that brother will be harsh to the other one, causing the other brother to have a further reaction
Rather, we must have a fine expression toward the brothers and the sisters, behaving and conducting ourselves in a fine way
If we would trust in the Lord for a proper attitude, we will be saved, delivered, and kept away from many misunderstandings
We must not have carelessness in our attitude that can be taken advantage of and used for an attack by the enemy
Meekness is a matter of an unselfish attitude that is mild and gentle, never argues for oneself, and never makes an excuse for oneself
Otherwise, we will have a wrong attitude, and this wrong attitude will be an advantage taken by the enemy in order to attack us
A brother may wrong us, but for the Lord's glory and for the sake of the church life, we should not speak a word about it
If a brother wrongs us, we will tell our spouse immediately, and then we will use the telephone to tell the story to someone else
If we learn to keep our words in such a proper way, we will realize the true meaning of the word suffering in the church life
If something happens to the ministry here, within a few days many churches overseas will already know about it
If we consider our past we will realize how much we have been involved in this practice of passing on stories unconsciously creating rumors
In order to learn the lesson of long-suffering, we need to experience the suffering of restricting our mouth and stopping our tongue
We may see and hear many things, but we should not speak a word without the anointing and leading of the Holy Spirit
No one taught us this lesson in the way of Bible teaching, but by the Lord's mercy we have learned this from our experience
It is always a temptation to know others' attitude toward us, how they consider us, and what they have said about us
If, on the contrary, someone is suspicious, this will cause a reaction, and this reaction will cause a chain reaction
The church life is tested by the peace we have, not only vertically with God but also horizontally with all the brothers
If those brothers and sisters had not been likeminded Paul could not have been happy and he would have had no encouragement and consolation
The different teachings Paul speaks of minister questions rather than the building economics of God, which is in faith
The law and the genealogies of the Old Testament are both scriptural, but these teachings are different from that of the apostle Paul
The central thought of the teaching of the apostle Paul can be seen in his fourteen Epistles from Romans through Hebrews
In his time there were other teachers, teaching things that seemed to be scriptural but were very different from his teaching
Because the apostle encountered this problem, he asked Timothy to stay at Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently
Both in 1 Corinthians and in Philippians the apostle Paul deals with the divisive factors of the mind, the opinion, and speaking
We have studied the Bible and history, compared them to our present situation, and examined the situation according to our experience
If he had seen something that was not fitting, the best and most proper way to deal with it would have been to speak privately about it
He stood up to begin the meeting, and he announced the hymn, offered a prayer, read the Bible, and spoke a word
We all practice baptism, but some baptize by immersion, some by sprinkling, and some even baptize by waving a flag over people
In other places the brothers baptize in the name of the Lord, in the name of Christ, or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
Some immerse once, but others immerse three times, once each for the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
He said that water baptism is dispensationally over and that today we need only the baptism in the Holy Spirit
Shortly afterward in another place, a sister stood up in the middle of my message and said, 'Tell me, do you baptize people with water?
According to history, all the denominations arose because someone began to stress a particular teaching or practice
If a local church has been raised up under a certain kind of practice, we should be wise and not speak differently against its practice
Still, we should not stress it, and we should always be watchful as to whether or not our speaking will cause trouble
In a local church that meets on the proper ground, the brothers and sisters may have been raised up under a ministry that teaches dichotomy
The more we try to adjust people, the more we lose our credit with them, and they will have no confidence in us
As we have said, if we go to a place where dichotomy is taught, we should not speak against it, and we should not insist on trichotomy
If certain ones who teach dichotomy come to our locality, they also should recognize the facts and respect the present situation among us
Those who come to us should recognize the situation with the church and the ministry, whether or not they agree with trichotomy
He may simply minister something of the love of Christ, our love toward Christ, and the way to fellowship with the Lord and touch Him
If someone has learned something of Christ in his spirit and has a real surplus of Christ, he can offer a prayer in the Lord's table meeting
That prayer uplifted the entire congregation to the extent that no one paid attention to the message afterward
