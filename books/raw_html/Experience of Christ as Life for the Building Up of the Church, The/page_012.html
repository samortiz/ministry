<P>In the last two chapters of the Bible, the tree of life appears again, and it appears in a river, the river of water of life (Rev. 22:1). This river is flowing in a city built of gold, pearls, and precious stones (21:18-21). The New Jerusalem is absolutely a city of gold. It has just one street, and the street of the city is also gold because it is a part of the city proper. The twelve gates are pearls, and the wall of the city is built with jasper stone. Twelve kinds of precious stones are the twelve layers of its foundation. Thus, gold, pearl, and precious stone seen in Genesis 2 are for God's building, which is consummated in Revelation 21 and 22.</P><P>We also need to see something more in Genesis 2. After the precious materials, there is a bride to be the increase of Adam. Adam was a bachelor, but after Eve came into being, Adam had a counterpart to match him. Adam is a type of Christ (Rom. 5:14), and Eve is a type of the church (Gen. 2:24; cf. Eph. 5:31-32). The church is the increase of Christ.</P><P>In order for Eve to come into being, God put Adam to sleep and took a bone, a rib, out of his side, with which He built a woman (Gen. 2:21-22). Sleep signifies death (1 Cor. 15:18; 1 Thes. 4:13-16; John 11:11-14). Christ was made to sleep, to die, on the cross, and His side was also opened up. Out of Christ's side flowed blood and water (John 19:34). Blood is for redemption, to deal with sin (1:29; Heb. 9:22). Water is for imparting life to deal with death (John 12:24; 3:14-15). The flowing water out of the Lord's side and the rib out of Adam's side both signify the resurrection life by which the church comes into being. The church is built and constituted with Christ as the resurrection life.</P><P>In the first two chapters of the Bible are the tree of life, the river, three kinds of precious material, and the bride. In the last two chapters of the Bible are again the tree of life, the river, three kinds of precious material, and the bride, who is composed of all the precious materials as a building. The two ends of the Bible are united to each other.</P><P>Right after Genesis 2 we see the serpent in Genesis 3. This old serpent is seen throughout the entire Bible and will do his subtle work to damage and frustrate the Lord's work until he is cast out in Revelation 20 (vv. 2-3, 10). The first two chapters of the Bible, before Satan came in, are continued by the last two chapters of the Bible, after Satan is cast out. Today we are in the experience of Revelation 12, where there is a struggling between the old serpent and the wife, the woman. I hope that not long from now we will enter into the day when Satan is cast out. Then we will enter into the last two chapters of the Bible.</P>
