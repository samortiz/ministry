        <h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF MIGRATION</h2><p>Seven or eight years ago, God released messages about "migration" through His servant. Although some brothers and sisters have already migrated from Northern China to the Northwest, most still do not pay much attention to what migration really is. Two or three years ago, God's servants reminded us again. The eyes of a few more brothers and sisters were opened, but the practice seemed to be far away in the unforeseeable future! Thank God that in the winter of the year before last, He began a migration from eastern Chekiang. Last winter, He also began the migration from Shanghai. Even to this day, there are still migrations going on. All the brothers and sisters who take the way of migration sell their possessions, leave their homeland, and move to farming communities where they do not know anyone. What is the purpose of this? While one intention surely is to engage in rural production, the real goal is to share the benefit of the gospel with others.</p><p>We see more and more clearly that we must migrate if we want to spread the gospel to the ends of the earth. If we want to be released from the bondage of the world, if we do not want to struggle with the world, we must migrate. Furthermore, if we want to really prove our love and willingness to suffer for the Lord and give up everything to follow Him, we must take the way of migration.</p><p>Migration is God's heart's desire. It is God's call and our response. When God created man, He wanted man to fill the entire earth (Gen. 1:28). After the fall, man built cities on earth and even the tower of Babel. Then God called Abraham and told him to leave his country, relatives, and father's house to go to the place which the Lord would show him (12:1). We see two signs in the life of Abraham: an altar and a tent. This means that he lived a life of consecration and the life of a sojourner. His desire was to live absolutely for the Lord. His living did not take root in this world. As descendants of Abraham, there is no doubt that we should follow in his footsteps.</p><p>In the New Testament the Lord commands us to go into all the world and to preach the gospel to all creation (Mark 16:15). He said, "You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and...unto the uttermost part of the earth" (Acts 1:8). If this were just for the twelve apostles, the seventy-two disciples, or even the one hundred twenty, how could they complete this commission? Therefore, all of God's children must have a burden and be willing to "go" in response to the call to "proclaim the gospel to all the creation." It is true that our hearts are for "Jerusalem" because it has a spiritual church, life-giving messages, and sweet fellowship. But if we continue to live in Jerusalem and forget God's intention, persecution will come as that recorded in Acts 8, and it will scatter the disciples abroad. It was through such persecution that the gospel went out.</p><p>The gospel has been in China for about one hundred years now, but it is only somewhat manifested in the few provinces along the coast. There is still a large area where no one has preached the gospel. There are still so many people who have never heard the gospel. The reason for this is that we are not willing to answer God's call to leave our homeland and families and go to the inland and the frontier lands.</p><p>How easy it is for us to fall into Lot's failure! (See Gen. 13:6-13). When we settle down in a place and establish roots, we lose the life of the tent. We forget that we are sojourners on the earth. We neglect the warning that woe will come to all those who are dwelling on the face of the whole earth (Luke 21:35; Rev. 8:13).</p><p>We are like those who are spoken of in Deuteronomy 32. The baby eagles do not want to leave their nests; they desire a peaceful life. God, however, has to accomplish His goal. To accomplish His heart's desire, He shakes the "nests" with His hand and forces us to leave the places we love (v. 11). May we have the inward sense to understand God's heart's desire and meet His demands. Even if we do not have a sense and understanding, we should be like the ignorant eagles; we should wake up when God's hand rocks the nests. We should answer His call and take the way of migration.</p><p>Only migration will spread the gospel. Only migration will cause us to forsake the world. Migration is the one way to express our consecration and true love for the Lord. Over the past few years, five or six hundred brothers and sisters in the North, in Shanghai, and in Xiao and Shao county in eastern Chekiang have answered God's call to give their all for the gospel. They have migrated to the Northwest and Kiangsi. We can truly testify that God is with those who have migrated. It is a confirmation that this way is pleasing to God! This is the way to obtain God's blessing!</p><p>We call on the Spirit of God to open the eyes of all the churches to truly see that migration is God's way for His churches today. We pray that God would touch more people with His love to take the way of migration.</p><p>Chang Yu-zhi</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
