 <h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH OUR TASTE</h2>
<p>Some saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, however, have tried to have their choice regarding the church. After staying in a certain place for a period of time, they became unhappy with the church there, especially with the leading ones. Therefore, they moved to another locality and stayed there for another period of time. Being unhappy there, they moved to still another place. In each locality the situation was the same. This illustrates the fact that no church can satisfy you according to your taste. Instead, what you need to do is to willingly bear the cross. Do not make any selection, for all the churches are the same. If you cannot be happy in one place, you will not be happy in any other place. Do not try to deal with the church, but deal with your taste.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO PREFERENCES</h2>
<p>Many are able to get along with the church, but not with some of the saints. If this is your situation, you are finished with the building. We need to take up the cross. If you make a selection among the churches, you are a wide open gate for Satan to come out. Thus, you must use the second key&mdash;the taking up of the cross. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, Your will is that there be one church in the universe and one church in every city. Lord, Your will is also that I be one with all my brothers and sisters. As long as anyone is a believer, I must accept him without choice or preference. My likes or dislikes do not mean anything.&rdquo; This is the unique way for us to be built together. Otherwise, our preferences and tastes will constantly fluctuate. Today I may feel positively toward you, but tomorrow I may feel negatively. Both in the church life and in married life there should be no fluctuation. What can keep us stable and steadfast is the bearing of the cross. This is the second practical key for the building of the church.</p>
<p>In the previous message we saw that the first key is denying the self. Now we see that the second key is taking up the cross. Denying the self is negative, whereas taking up the cross is positive. The only way to fulfill God&rsquo;s will is to take up the cross. Do not blame the brothers and sisters, and do not even blame yourself. Rather, simply take up the cross. Do not give any ground to your choice or preference. Your destiny is God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s ordination. We need to take the one church and all the brothers and sisters as God&rsquo;s will. However, deep within us we may have certain preferences. We may like some and dislike others. Because we are natural and human, we all have our preferences. But if we exercise our preference, there will not be any building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY OF THE GENUINE ONENESS</h2>
<p>All the demons and evil angels are observing us and examining our testimony. Thus, our testimony is not merely before men, but before the whole universe. What a shame it is if we talk about the building, but do not actually have the building because of our natural preferences! We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, help us and grant us the sufficient grace. We want to bear the cross so that no evil angel may be able to say a negative word about our testimony. We are here as the testimony of the building, and we want there to be no ground for the demons and evil angels to say anything.&rdquo; Man may not know what is taking place, but all the demons and evil angels understand what we are doing. They know what is in our heart and whether or not we are willing to take up the cross. If we are willing to bear the cross, then we are a real testimony.</p>
<p>A battle is raging today not simply before men, but before all the evil powers. Thus, we must have no preferences, no choices except the will of God; and we must take up the cross, that is, take up the will of God. If we have seen the vision of the one church and of all the saints as the members of the one Body, then we shall have no choice and no personal taste. We should not care for our taste, feeling, or consciousness. Rather, we should care only for God&rsquo;s will that we would have the genuine oneness, the oneness that can stand the investigation of all the demons and the principalities and powers. We want to have the testimony before the evil powers that we are a people with the genuine oneness because we are all willing to take up the cross. We are not suffering like criminals, but we are happy cross-bearers. I believe that at this end time throughout the entire earth there will be a people bearing such a testimony.</p>
