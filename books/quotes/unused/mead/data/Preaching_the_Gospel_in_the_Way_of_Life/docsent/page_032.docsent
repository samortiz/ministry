   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH'S NEED FOR NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>History tells us the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have been on this earth for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have been a genuine Christian for more than forty years, and I have been in this work for more than thirty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Just within the past two decades I have seen many groups in the Far East, in Europe, and in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I speak the truth that you can never have a living group of Christians serving the Lord in an adequate way without these five aspects to balance them: life, light, the church, service, and ultimately preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I saw some groups that were rich in life but poor in knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I also saw some groups, and I was with one of them, that were rich in knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One person among them was known as a "living concordance."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They were rich in knowledge, but they were very poor in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the past I have known some groups that were rich both in life and in knowledge, but they were poor in the church life, so they did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some groups even proclaim that they are rich in life, rich in knowledge, and also have the church life, but they are short of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After five years passed there were still the same number meeting with them, and after another five years there was no increase.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They always said, "The Lord is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is wonderful!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were wonderful for ten years but still with the same people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually in their twelfth year they lost their interest and disbanded.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I saw this in 1957 and again in 1963.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In another example, I recently received a letter saying that a group that had been meeting for more than twenty years also lost their interest and disbanded.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They said, "What are we doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Year after year we have the same people."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a family with only a wife and husband, the first five years are wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then the next five, even up to twenty years, are still wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After twenty-five years, however, they will not feel very wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They need some children, some "new ones."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same way, the church needs some new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order for the church to be strong, you have to have normal deliveries, normal births.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If next week fifty persons are baptized, the whole church will be on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, I was happy to see several people receive the Lord in a recent gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some may wonder how so many people could confess the Lord Jesus in just one meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the other hand, in the past I have seen one thousand people stand up to acknowledge the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is good for a few people to receive the Lord, but according to my experience, this seems like two drops of water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Still, though, the brothers and sisters are excited.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some proclaim, "This is wonderful, wonderful!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, if you would endeavor, pray, and work to bring more people in, next week you may baptize fifty, one hundred fifty, or two hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then you will be so excited that you will not care to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I saw this in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church needs new births, new deliveries.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church needs new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever there is such a suggestion to preach the gospel, the spirit of all the saints responds.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Holy Spirit within the spirit of the saints honors this, because this is the purpose of God in this age on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the church has lost sight of this matter, so now we have to recover this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to realize what we are doing here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are we here only to meet together and to have a wonderful message meeting on the Lord's Day morning and a wonderful Lord's table meeting in the evening?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Are we here to have a wonderful prayer meeting on Wednesday and a study meeting on Friday, and then do it again the next week, the next month, and the next year?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no need for five years to pass; even within this year if you would not bring in more people, someone will eventually say that there is no need for us to come together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There will be disappointment among us.</S>
