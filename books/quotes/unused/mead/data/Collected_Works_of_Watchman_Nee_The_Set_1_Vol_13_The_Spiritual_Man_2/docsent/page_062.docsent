   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION SEVEN THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOUL 1 THE EMOTION CHAPTER ONE THE BELIEVER AND THE EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a believer has not experienced the sure work of the cross, which is brought about by the Holy Spirit, he may have experienced deliverance from sin yet still be soulish and unable to overcome his own natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing chapters we have spoken concerning the believer's soulish life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we carefully study the soulish conduct and action of a believer, we see that both issue from his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although the soul includes three primary parts the mind, emotion, and will most soulish believers live by their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can almost say that they are controlled by their emotion in their soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because the emotion appears to occupy a greater part than the mind and the will in human life; its work also appears to assume a greater role in daily human living than the other parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we can see that nearly all the actions of soulish believers originate from their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE FUNCTION OF EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our human feelings joy, happiness, cheerfulness, excitement, sighing, irritation, stimulation, despondency, sadness, grief, depression, misery, sorrow, agitation, confusion, anxiety, enthusiasm, coldness, affection, fondness, covetousness, compassion, kindheartedness, preference, likes, interest, desire, expectation, pride, fear, remorse, hate, etc. all come out of our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All work related to our thinking issues out of the mind, our thinking organ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All work related to our decision-making originates from the will, our decision-making organ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Aside from our thoughts, decisions, and their related works, all other functions issue from the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our multitude of diverse feelings are the function of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since emotion comprises such a vast area, nearly all soulish believers are emotional believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Human emotion is very complicated because it comprises a vast area.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to help believers understand, we will subdivide emotion briefly into three major parts: 1 affection, 2 desire, and 3 feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These three parts cover three aspects of the emotion's function.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a believer can overcome these three aspects, he will soon enter into a pure spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In short, our human emotion comprises what we commonly call the "seven passions," which are nothing less than the different feelings we have in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether it is a feeling of love, hate, joy, grief, excitement, despondency, interest, or indifference, all of these comprise the different feelings in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, they all belong to the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we pay attention to the diverse feelings in our emotions, we will see that our emotion changes easily.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the world there are probably very few things that are as changeable as emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can feel one way one minute and feel another way the next.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Emotion changes according to feelings, and the latter changes very rapidly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, if one lives by emotion, his life is without principle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man's emotion always has a reactionary function.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that when man's feeling is active in one direction for a while, an opposite reaction is bound to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, extreme happiness is followed by sorrow, high excitement by great depression, and burning fervor by a feeling of deep withdrawal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even in the matter of affection, although it may begin in love, after a period of time certain influences may change one's feelings, when the intensity of hatred can far exceed the earlier love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE BELIEVER'S EMOTIONAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we consider the function of our emotional life, the more we know its fluctuation and undependability.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If believers do not live according to the spirit but according to their emotion, is it any wonder that their living undulates like the waves?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many believers feel sad about their living because their experiences are so unstable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes they seem to be in the third heavens transcending everything of the human life; at other times they seem to descend and share in the lot of ordinary men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their life is a series of ups and downs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It does not require something outwardly heavy and big to change them; as long as a little thing is contrary to their wish, they are unable to withstand it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Subsequently, they fall.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This phenomenon relates to the fact that a believer is controlled by emotion and not by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since his emotion is still the major element of his life and has not been taken to the cross, the spirit cannot be strengthened by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, the believer's spirit is still weak; he cannot control his whole being, nor can he overcome his emotion so that it becomes secondary, completely under the control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a believer can hand over his emotion to the cross through the Holy Spirit and accept the Holy Spirit as the Lord over all things, he surely can avoid this kind of undulating life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Emotion may be considered as the greatest enemy to the life of a spiritual believer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A believer should walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To do this, he must heed every leading of the spirit within him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The sense of the spirit is gentle, fine, and keen.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Unless the believer attentively waits to receive and discern the revelation of his spiritual intuition, he can never obtain the guidance of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the total silence of the emotion is a prerequisite to walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The small and delicate sense of the spirit is often confused and ignored by the believer because his feelings are roaring like billows.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot ultimately attribute any fault to the softness of our spirit's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually we can adequately feel the sense of the spirit, but when other feelings are mixed with it, we cannot possibly have discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whoever keeps his emotion calm will see that it is easy to detect the voice of the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The rising and falling of the emotion not only hinders the believer from walking according to the spirit, but also directly causes him to walk according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since he cannot walk according to the spirit, he naturally walks according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If he cannot secure guidance in his spirit, he naturally walks according to the impulse of his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever the spirit ceases to guide, the emotion starts to guide.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At that moment a believer will spontaneously take the emotion as his inspiration and the impulses of the soul as the moving of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>An emotional believer can be likened to a pond full of mud and sand.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As long as no one comes to disturb the water, it looks clear; but once it is disturbed, it becomes muddy.</S>
