   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Filled with God s Life and Light</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are two elements within the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One element is God s life, and the other is God s light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Concerning God s life, in the middle of the street in the city flows the river of water of life, bright as crystal 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition, on this side and on that side of the river grows the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, and yielding its fruit each month v. 2 . The river of water of life and the tree of life are the nourishing supply in the city.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the inward condition of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to its outward appearance, the New Jerusalem is the effulgence of God s glory, expressing the image of God who has the appearance of jasper.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when we believed in the Lord, we received redemption, and we are now being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The issue of transformation is our maturity and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 8:30 says, Those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that we have a part in the glory that is yet to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This glory is the consummate expression of God, the effulgence of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, we will all be in this glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will be glorified.</S>
