   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Defeating the Tempter</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>by Worshipping God and Serving Him Only</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 10 the Lord Jesus said, Go, Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Satan in Greek means adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is not only God s enemy outside God s kingdom, but also the adversary within God s kingdom, rebelling against God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The new King rebuked the Devil s presentation and defeated him by standing on the ground of man to worship and serve God only.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To worship or to serve anything other than God for gain is always the Devil s temptation to secure worship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord seemed to be saying to Satan, Satan, as a man, I, Jesus, worship God and serve Him only.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You are God s enemy, and I will never worship you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I don t care for the glory of the world or for the kingdoms of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Satan, get away from Me!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we consider our experience, we shall see that all temptations are included in these three aspects: the temptation in the matter of our living, the temptation of religious miracles, and the temptation in the realm of worldly glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All day long we are tempted in the aspects of our living, religion, and worldly position.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Lord Jesus overcame every aspect of the enemy s temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He could say, My living is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I don t care for religious power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And worldly glory has nothing to do with Me. I know only God s word and God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I care only to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, as the One who passed the test, the Lord Jesus was qualified to be the King of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. The Result</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 11 says, Then the Devil leaves Him; and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Devil s temptation of the first man, Adam, was a success; his temptation of the second man, Christ, was an absolute failure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that he will have no place in the new King s kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the Lord Jesus defeated Satan, angels came and ministered to the tempted King as a suffering man cf.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Luke 22:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only the King but also all the kingdom people must overcome the matters of their daily living, religious power, and worldly glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we cannot overcome these three temptations, we are outside the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we would be the kingdom people, these three things must be under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we kill these three temptations, saying, I don t care for my living, for religious power, or for worldly position, Satan will not be able to do anything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not be concerned about our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Consider the example of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul said, I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to be in want Phil 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul seemed to be saying, It does not matter to me whether I have poverty or abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I can live in either scarcity or plenty.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The matter of my daily living does not worry me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, instead of caring for religious power, we should be weak, just as Jesus Christ was weak when He was arrested and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If He had not been weak, who could have arrested Him and put Him on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When He was arrested, tried, and crucified, He made no display of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He refused to exhibit any religious power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, He was weak to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul said that Christ was crucified out of weakness ; he also said, We are weak in Him 2 Cor 13:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many devilish people challenged Paul, saying, If you are the true apostle of Christ, you must do something to prove it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when Paul was in prison, the Lord did not do anything miraculous for him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul s situation was the same as that of John the Baptist, who also had been imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After a certain period of imprisonment, John sent his disciples to challenge the Lord, saying, Are You the coming One, or should we expect someone else?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John seemed to be saying, If You are the coming One, why don t You do something for me?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Don t You know that I, Your forerunner and recommender, am in prison?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Are you not powerful?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Are You not Christ the almighty?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If so, do something for me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In His answer, the Lord said, Blessed is he who shall not be stumbled in Me 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord seemed to be saying, Yes, I can do anything, but I don t want to do anything for you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although you are My recommender, My forerunner, I don t care to do anything for you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I would rather that you would be beheaded.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>John, will you be stumbled by Me?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brother Nee s experience is an up-to-date illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was in prison from 1952 until he died in 1972.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During those twenty years, the Lord did not do anything for him in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How we need to overcome these three kinds of temptation: the temptation of our living, the temptation of so-called religious power, and the temptation of vain glory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we conquer these things, we are truly the kingdom people following our heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hallelujah, our heavenly King overcame the tempter and defeated him in these three temptations!</S>
