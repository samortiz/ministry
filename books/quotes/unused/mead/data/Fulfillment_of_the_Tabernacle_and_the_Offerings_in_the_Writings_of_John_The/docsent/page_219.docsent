   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIGN OF THE LORD'S SECRET ASCENSION TO THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Early in the morning on the day of His resurrection, Christ went secretly to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was a secret ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 17 the Lord told Mary the Magdalene not to touch Him, because He had "not yet ascended to the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This secret ascension to the Father was the ultimate fulfillment of the going predicted in 16:5-7, and it took place forty days before His public ascension in the sight of the disciples Acts 1:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After ascending to satisfy the Father, He returned to the disciples John 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the firstfruit of the harvest in typology was first brought to God, so the freshness of the Lord's resurrection was first for the Father's enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Old Testament type of which we are speaking is found in Leviticus 23:10-11: "Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, concerning the firstfruits Exodus 23:19 says this: "The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The firstfruits were not to be enjoyed by the people; rather, they were to be offered to God for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Leviticus 23:11, the day the firstfruit was offered to God was one day after the Sabbath, that is, on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From the day the firstfruit was offered, the people were to count seven weeks Lev 23:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The feast of Pentecost would then be held on the fiftieth day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The time from John 20 to the day of Pentecost in Acts 2 was exactly fifty days.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the Lord was resurrected, He manifested Himself to His disciples over a period of forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the expiration of those days, He publicly ascended to the heavens; that is, He ascended openly in the sight of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following His public ascension, the disciples prayed for ten days, and then the day of Pentecost came.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord's secret ascension is inserted into John's account of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to be impressed with the fact that in John's record there is such an insertion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Immediately after the Lord was resurrected, He was ready to go to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, He was held back for a little while by the love of Mary the Magdalene.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because Mary was there seeking Him, He did not go immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, He remained for a time to take care of this sister, who was weeping because she could not find Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After speaking with her, He ascended to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was a good thing that the Lord was held back.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is due to this delay that we have the revelation recorded in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If Mary had not been present, the Lord would not have had anyone to whom to speak these words: "I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What a great revelation this is!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we did not have this word, how would we know that on the day of the Lord's resurrection we became His brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should be thankful to Mary that her love held the Lord back at least for a few minutes in order to reveal such a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This word is part of the record that indicates Christ's secret ascension to present the firstfruit of resurrection to the Father for His enjoyment.</S>
