<p>In this message we want to fellowship concerning the human spirit of the believers. In the previous two messages we saw the truth concerning the Spirit of life. God&rsquo;s move in His eternal economy is altogether wrapped up with the Spirit, and the Spirit is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. Not only so, such a life-giving Spirit is the completion of God&rsquo;s economy. Without such a Spirit, God&rsquo;s economy has no way to be completed. So we must pay our full attention to the Spirit of life, who is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy is to gain man and make man the same as He is for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ. This is the goal: the organic Body of Christ. What God wants, what God desires, is only the organic Body of Christ in which God has constituted Himself with humanity. Do not care for today&rsquo;s Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. All these religions are counterfeit. They not only confiscate what God wants but also have become and still are veils upon people. Thus, people cannot see that the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy is the organic Body of Christ. It is fully unveiled in the holy Scriptures with sixty-six books, but Satan uses Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism to veil the teachers of the Bible.</p>
<p>For example, the term <em>economy of God</em> is clearly unveiled by Paul&rsquo;s writing. In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to do one thing. This was to charge certain teachers not to teach things different from the economy of God. Timothy was to charge them not to teach things about the law, genealogies, or myths fabricated by the rabbis. We are to teach just one thing: the economy of God. Whoever reads 1 Timothy 1:3-4 should ask what the economy of God is, because this is the top thing concerning which Paul exhorted Timothy. Thank the Lord that over the past thirty years, the merciful Lord has opened our eyes to see God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 speaks of the economy of the fullness of the times. Then in Ephesians 3 Paul said that he received grace, as one who was less than the least among the saints, to minister the unsearchable riches of Christ to people for the church to come into existence and to enlighten all that they might see what the economy of the mystery is (vv. 8-11). What a great light this is! The Lord&rsquo;s servants should not be just teachers, teaching people the Bible, or pastors, pastoring a flock. But every one should be a minister, ministering not doctrines but the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.</p>
<p>We need to realize that Satan hates the high peak of the divine revelation concerning the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s economy. He hates this one main point&mdash;that God became a man so that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead to produce the organic Body of Christ for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy to close this age and to bring Christ back to set up His kingdom. This is why we need prayer for fighting the spiritual warfare for the release of these messages. Today where is the Body of Christ on this earth? Today who understands and ministers and practices the Body of Christ? This is altogether something new. God purposely in His incarnation became a man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead for the producing of the organic Body of Christ to fulfill God&rsquo;s economy to close this age and to bring Christ back with His kingdom. All these crystallization messages are for this purpose. They are for the producing of the church life, the Body life.</p>
<p>Today we have to know our mingled spirit and to exercise our spirit. This mingled spirit is the unique organ for God to bring forth and build up the Body of Christ. The center of God&rsquo;s creation was His forming a spirit within man. Zechariah 12:1 and Isaiah 42:5 indicate that the spirit of man should be ranked with the heavens and the earth. According to the concept of the prophets, there are only three big things in the universe besides God. God, of course, is the biggest. Besides God there are the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</p>
<p>The heavens are for the earth. The rain, sunshine, and fresh air from the heavens are for the earth to grow things. Then the earth is for man. The vegetable life, animal life, and minerals of the earth are for man&rsquo;s existence. Man&rsquo;s physical body is constituted with these things. Our body is made of the dust of the earth and is constituted with minerals such as copper, iron, and sulphur. For such a dusty body to live, the earth is needed. Thus, the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and finally, man is for God. In order for man to be for God, man needs a spirit. Man is physical, dusty, but God is not. God is Spirit, so man needs a spirit to contact God. This is why God created man in a very particular way by making a spirit for man. For God&rsquo;s fulfillment of His eternal economy, three things are the greatest: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</p>
