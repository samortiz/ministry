   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having a Normal Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must also have a practical living in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even though the brothers are busy with their occupations and the sisters are busy with their households, we still must quietly consider how to properly apportion our time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everyone should have a schedule in which we clearly list what we will do for the week.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are all busy, and we have many things that we must do; however, in order to learn to do things according to their importance and urgency, we should make a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, when we receive a letter, we do not need to read it immediately if it is not urgent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Telegrams, however, are usually short and important and should be read immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since we have so many things to take care of and not enough time for all of them, we must learn to take care of things in the order of their importance and urgency.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we must make a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we will know how much time we can spend daily laboring in the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the church life, it is good for the saints to attend four meetings a week.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In almost every place in the world, no one works on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we should go to the Lord s Day morning meeting and to the bread-breaking meeting in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, it should not be too difficult to have two evening meetings during the remaining six days in the week.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is necessary to have four meetings in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have considered combining the Lord s Day morning meeting with the table meeting, but it is not so easy to combine them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are hasty, both meetings will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To combine them in a good way, we must have the Lord s Day meeting like some localities in America they meet from the morning until about one or two in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then they stay and eat lunch together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way there is enough time for a message and to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do this because it is not easy for the brothers and sisters who live far apart in large cities to make two trips to the meeting hall in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the city is not large, and if the brothers and sisters do not live far apart from each other, it is better for them to meet in the morning and in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In addition to the two Lord s Day meetings, during the week there is the need for a prayer meeting and for a meeting to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These four meetings are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No matter how busy they are, the saints must budget their time and endeavor to attend these four meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we practice this, the ones under our care will gradually begin to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not consider these four meetings to be insignificant; they have much influence on our living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Attending these four meetings can be compared to eating regular meals instead of starving oneself and then eating a huge meal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church life is a healthy life; if we are so busy with other matters that we frequently miss the meetings and can attend the meetings only occasionally, it is like missing many meals and then eating a big meal sporadically.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After a long period of time of eating in this way, we will not be very healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to be clear about the truth, we must study the Bible every day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not read it in a general way; instead, we should study it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Merely reading the Bible every day is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should also use the best reference books so that our knowledge of the truth will constantly increase.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By the Lord s mercy I have not left His Word for the past sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this reason, the light within me is constantly increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord s Word has a free way to flow within me, and when it flows, the light comes from every side.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows that we must know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the future the full-time co-workers will encourage preaching the gospel on the campuses, in the homes, to the children, and in the community.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Full-timers are needed for the gospel on the campuses and in the schools; otherwise, it will be difficult to maintain the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With regard to the children s work, even though the junior high and high school students can teach in the children s meetings, the children s work will be carried forward by the full-timers, because they will prepare teaching materials and make a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The number of children in the church in Taipei has dropped to five hundred because there is a lack of co-workers to carry the work forward.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the children s work is to spread, we must preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not limit our work to the children of the saints who are in our meetings; we also need to invite the children of our neighbors and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, we hope that every home will be open for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This requires that the co-workers visit the saints in order to encourage them to open their homes and that the co-workers help the saints who are willing to open their homes to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Initially, the co-workers will have to take the lead in the homes, but after a few gospel times, the saints will be able to take care of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to be flexible in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, the co-workers need to go out and encourage the saints, and on the other hand, the saints should not depend on the elders and co-workers; they must learn to do things themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If all the saints know the truth, have some growth in life, and live the normal church life, they will not be sidetracked or get into trouble regardless of how crazy they are when they preach the gospel or how thick their skin is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They will have the ground with people, and they will have the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we learn the truth, have some growth in life, and participate in the proper church life, we spontaneously become stable and dependable people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We will regularly lead others to salvation, and they will do what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this way, the church will be built up, and the Lord will have a testimony on the earth that will cause the bride to be prepared.</S>
