<h1 class="title">TEACHING SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE&mdash;<br />
THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: March 10, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TEN POINTS CONCERNING CHRIST</h2>
<p>The first item to teach the young people related to spiritual knowledge is Christ. Concerning Christ, we need to pay attention to ten points: His divinity, His relation to all things, His incarnation (including His humanity), His crucifixion, His resurrection from the dead, His becoming the life-giving Spirit, His ascension, His giving of the Holy Spirit, His second coming and the establishment of the kingdom, and His centrality in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IMPORTANT VERSES CONCERNING<br />
THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will look at some important verses concerning the divinity of Christ. Christ exists from eternity past. His nature is eternal and divine. We cannot separate Christ&rsquo;s divinity from His eternal being. We must help the young people to see that our Savior is the unique God, who is without beginning and without end and who is self-existing and eternally existing.</p>
<p>There are several important verses that speak of His eternal, divine nature which we can use as material, but we must be flexible in our use of them. Of these verses, most are appropriate for junior high students. A few more of them can be added for high school students, and all the verses can be used with college students. This is a big topic that will require more than one meeting to cover.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;His Goings Forth Are from Ancient Times, /<br />
From the Days of Eternity&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2 says, &ldquo;But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, / So little to be among the thousands of Judah, / From you there will come forth to Me / He who is to be Ruler in Israel; / And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; This verse is quoted in Matthew 2:5-6 to prove that Christ as the Savior, the Ruler, would be born in Bethlehem of Judea. When Micah 5:2 says that Christ would be born in Bethlehem, it is referring to His birth in time and space. However, the last part of the verse says, &ldquo;His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; Hence, although our Savior was born in time and space, He exists from ancient times and from the days of eternity. <em>Ancient times</em> and <em>days of eternity</em> denote eternity past, before time even existed. These words are equal to the phrase <em>in the beginning</em> in John 1:1, which is different from the phrase <em>in the beginning</em> in Genesis 1:1. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; but Genesis 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; <em>In the beginning</em> in John refers to the eternal existence of the Lord Jesus, which is from eternity past, without a beginning. <em>In the beginning</em> in Genesis refers to the creation of the universe, which occurred at the beginning of time. This explanation has levels of complexity that need to be considered when speaking to junior high, high school, and college students.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;In the Beginning Was the Word&rdquo;</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; These verses show that the Word who was in the beginning, who was God, and who became flesh and tabernacled among us is Christ. The Christ who was in the beginning was not only God but also the Word. This Word is God spoken, God expressed. <em>Word</em> indicates that God, who was in the beginning, would be expressed.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s words are rather philosophical. He was not a simple man. When he wrote this Gospel, John was dealing with philosophical problems that were current at that time. In particular, there were many issues being debated concerning the divinity of the Lord Jesus. John wrote this book to deal with this particular problem. He began by saying that Christ is the Word, that is, God expressed. If Christ is God, God is the Word. This means that God can be expressed. As the Word, Christ is God expressed. This expressed God was in the beginning. Although His expression was not visible to others, He existed, and He desired to speak Himself forth, to express Himself more fully. In the beginning He was both God and the Word. God is His essence, and the Word is His expression. In essence He is God, whereas in expression He is the Word. This content, which is more philosophical in nature, is more appropriate for college students.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;A Son Is Given to Us...<br />
and His Name Will Be Called...Eternal Father&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us... / And His name will be called... / Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; Although He is the Son given to us, He is the Father. <em>Mighty God</em> is in contrast to <em>child.</em> Although He is the child born to us, He is the Mighty God. Hence, this verse speaks first of a child and Son and then of the Mighty God and Eternal Father. <em>Son</em> and <em>Eternal Father</em> are a pair, just as <em>child</em> and <em>Mighty God</em> are a pair. This truth is presented in the way of contrast, and when we point out this contrast, it is not too difficult for even a junior high school student to understand. This is a wonderful portion of the Bible that refers to the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was called the Son. John 3:36 says, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life.&rdquo; John 5:22 says, &ldquo;Neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son.&rdquo; Furthermore, 3:16 says, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.&rdquo; From these verses we see that the Son given to us is the Lord Jesus; He is the only begotten Son given to us. Then in verse 36 John says, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life.&rdquo; Furthermore, according to 10:30, the Son and the Father are one. Hence, the Son given to us is called Eternal Father; He is the Father from ancient times (Micah 5:2). If we are speaking to students in junior high or high school, Isaiah 9:6 is sufficient. If we are speaking to college students, we can include the verses from the Gospel of John.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Leading the Young People with the Word and the Spirit &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
