<h2 class=head1>Who Are Demons?</h2><p>The question may be asked, “Who are demons?” A close study of the cases of demonized persons described in the New Testament would preclude the idea that they are of the angelic order of created beings; moreover, the word for demon is daimon, instead of angelos, which is the word for angel. The early church fathers believed demons to be the wicked dead (human beings) and that belief is shared by many Christians of modern times. Says Dr. Haldeman in his recent book, Can the Dead Communicate with the Living?, “Scripture teaches us that a certain class of the dead do come back, enter in and possess the bodies of the living. These are called ‘devils,’ but the word should be ‘demons.’”<p>The teacher will certainly be guilty of the omission of vital truth for the crisis days in which we are living, if the subject of demon possession is passed by. The members of the class should be carefully instructed as to the way in which persons may unwittingly give ground to demons. They should see that a perception of their identification with the Victor of Calvary is absolutely necessary if they are to constantly and victoriously resist the obsession of evil spirits. They should be taught that manifesting a spirit of self-pity, pride, jealousy, discouragement, inordinate affection, may give just the ground that is necessary for the manipulation of evil spirits, if not full possession.<p>Entertaining fanatical religious views always opens the door to evil spirits, as truly as does any wrong practice. The fact that Christian workers, missionaries and other devoted children of God have suffered greatly from the manipulation of evil spirits during the last few years, proves that the necessary teaching along this line has been withheld. So little has this subject been understood that many persons have stoutly maintained that a Christian could never experience demon possession; but an ounce of fact is worth a pound of theory. Many Christians have been conscious of the working of evil spirits in some part of the being, and this manipulation continued until they were delivered as were those cases recorded in the New Testament.<p>Vital reckoning upon identification with a Crucified, Risen, Ascended, Glorified Lord, and unceasing praise, will keep the believer safe from the subtle working of the demons who are swarming about us.<p>There are times when the spoken word must be used, especially by those who are seeking to deliver bound souls, or in the times of special pressure that come to all Christians. The following words have been used by many and the results of their use prove their value: “I refuse everything that is of the defeated one. I yield to everything that is of God, and I put the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, shed at Calvary, between me and all the powers of the defeated enemy.” Until one has spoken these words aloud, the results cannot be understood. We must remember that the spoken word carries weight in the invisible world. The powers of darkness cannot see what is down deep in our spirit. We cannot know ourselves what is taking place there, until God reveals it to us through our spiritual and mental perception—but the invisible intelligences hear our words and they watch our faces and note our acts. How necessary, then, that our words always state the facts as recorded in God’s Written Word, and our faces reveal the peace and joy that come from believing, and our daily steps be ordered in His Word. We should never utter or write a discouraging word. Even a despondent, “Oh dear!” may betray the loophole that the watching powers of darkness will be quick to see.<h2 class=head1>The Attitude of Praise</h2><p>This matter of praising God is far more important than most Christians realize. There is a reason underlying the repeated command, “Praise ye the Lord.” God knows what praise will do for His children; therefore not once, but many, many times, He bids them utter the words of praise. If a word of discouragement opens the door for the enemy, then a word of praise closes the door and locks it. Moreover, it drives the enemy far away. Nothing is more distasteful to evil spirits than the praise of a trustful child of God, and nothing more truly glorifies God than the sacrifice of praise.<p class=indent1>On the wings of praise there will come into our hearts and lives every desirable emotion, overflowing outpourings of God. It is not our love or our praise but God’s own praise. Obey God who commands, “Praise ye the Lord.”…But one may say, “Can I praise God when I do not feel like it?” Yes, praise Him because that is His will concerning you (1 Thes. 5:18) and He will meet and take care of the feeling. (Edgar K. Sellew)<p>God has commanded His people to praise Him, and certain conditions will not be realized until all obey. (See Psa. 67:5-6.)<p>Viewed from the psychological and physiological standpoints, the value of praise can scarcely be estimated, as it is impossible to tabulate all the beneficial results to be realized in the spiritual, mental and physical realm as this command is obeyed. What would be the result if Christians should begin to praise God continually? Surely great deliverance would be realized throughout the earth, and angels would see the clearing of the heavens as the reverberation of the praises of God’s people mounted upward, and God would be glorified. Yet the average Christian considers literal obedience to the oft repeated command, “Praise ye the Lord,” as foolish and fanatical, choosing instead to praise Him only when he feels like doing so.
