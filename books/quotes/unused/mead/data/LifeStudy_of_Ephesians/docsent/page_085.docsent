   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For God s Dispensation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This stewardship of the grace is for God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that the desire of God s heart is to dispense His riches, which actually are Himself, into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After these riches have been dispensed into us, we need to take up the burden to dispense them into others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With God, these riches are His economy; with us, they are the stewardship; and when they are dispensed by us into others, they are God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God s economy reaches us, it becomes our stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we carry out our stewardship by dispensing Christ into others, it becomes the dispensation of God into them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we have the economy, the stewardship, and the dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our concept of preaching the gospel needs to be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not be concerned merely with winning souls.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, we should preach the gospel to carry out God s economy by dispensing God into others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Go to school or to work for the purpose of carrying out your stewardship according to God s economy for His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not doing an ordinary work of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are dispensing God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What a glorious ministry!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What a wonderful stewardship!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Praise the Lord that we all have such a stewardship!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have the privilege of dispensing the unsearchable riches of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. The Grace</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since our stewardship is the stewardship of the grace, we need to see what grace is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 1:17 says that grace came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During the time of the Old Testament, there was law, but not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Grace did not come until Christ came.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians think that grace refers mainly to material blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the Bible indicates that grace did not come before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, God certainly bestowed material blessings on His people before Christ came.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Grace is nothing less than God Himself given to us, gained by us, and enjoyed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before Christ came, God could not be given to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one could receive God or enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in Christ and through Christ we receive God, and God becomes our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, grace is God Himself as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The stewardship of grace is the dispensing of God into people to be their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Dispensing this grace into others is our stewardship according to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because we partake of God as our enjoyment, we can dispense Him as grace into others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE MINISTRY OF A MINISTER</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 3:7 Paul says that he became a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the New Testament there is just one ministry, which is the stewardship, the dispensing of God into people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word minister corresponds to the word steward, for a steward is one who serves by dispensing the necessities of life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only the brothers who minister the Word of God or the elders who care for the local building are ministers, but every saint, every member of the church, has a part in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not be cheated by the traditional concept and think that you are not a minister.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A minister is simply one who serves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A minister of the gospel serves people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a young sister ministers Christ to her mother, she is carrying out the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the saints must be bold to declare that they are ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must not only speak this but put it into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Young people, go to your parents and minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I encourage you all to fulfill this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although there may be thousands of saints in the Lord s recovery, there is just one ministry, the dispensing of the riches of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hallelujah for this glorious ministry!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A. According to the Gift of the Grace of God</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our ministry is according to the gift of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To say that grace is God for our enjoyment means that grace is God as our life and life supply 1 Cor 15:10; 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This life supply operates within us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By means of this operating life, we have a certain ability, which is the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, in 3:7 Paul speaks of being a minister according to the gift of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the saints have such a gift, such an ability.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, my hand has the ability to grasp objects.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This ability comes from the life blood in my body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the blood does not flow into my hand, my hand will be short of life and therefore will not be able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But when the life blood flows into my hand, the blood operates within the hand to give it the ability to function.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As members of Christ, we all have the life of God operating within us to produce a certain ability.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This ability is the gift that makes us ministers to impart Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>B. To Preach the Unsearchable Riches</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>of Christ as the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our ministry is to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not to present doctrine nor simply to teach the Word in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our gospel is a Person with all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To preach such a gospel is to minister the riches of Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>C. For Producing the Church</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This ministry is for producing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The ministry of the Apostle Paul as God s steward was to bring forth the church by dispensing the unsearchable riches of Christ as grace into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Paul s ministry was not only to save sinners, but to produce the church for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This was the goal of his stewardship of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>D. By Revelation of the Mystery in Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>According to 3:3 and 5, our ministry is by the revelation of the mystery in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As long as we have seen Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ, we have the revelation of the mystery in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This enables us to minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is a matter in our regenerated spirit which is indwelt by the Spirit of God.</S>
