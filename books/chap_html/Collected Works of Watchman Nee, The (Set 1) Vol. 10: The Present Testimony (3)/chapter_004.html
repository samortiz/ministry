<H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 25</H2><P>Praise God that His grace and power have enabled us once again to publish another volume of The Present Testimony. His provision and His guidance are precious. The messages concerning the New Testament in this volume are a continuation of the last volume. However, I would like everyone to remember that each of these messages can stand alone by itself. The messages in this volume emphasize that the foundation of the New Testament is based upon the blood of the Lord Jesus. As to the messages, "In Christ" and "God's Way of Redemption," one needs to read them with much prayer and God's revelation. If there is prayer and revelation, everything will become reality. Otherwise, it will merely disappear like fleeing clouds and will not be of much use.</P><P>I need to explain some more concerning the writings which appeared in the past in The Present Testimony and Notes on Scriptural Messages. Most of the articles are notes from my messages. Although I have spent much time in polishing them, the style and expressions are basically the same as when I originally delivered them. They would have been clearer and mistakes would have been fewer if I had rewritten them, but this was impossible because of my busy schedule. Therefore, I beg the brothers to forgive me if there are any mistakes in structure or expression.</P><P>Concerning those who have corresponded with me, I would like you to know I have read your letters and sympathize with you, but because of my physical weakness, busy schedule, frequent travel, and lack of help, in many cases I have been unable to answer them right away. In some cases I have not been able to answer them at all. This indeed is regrettable, but in my present situation I see no hope of improvement. I beg the brothers to forgive me, for if I answered all the letters, I would not be able to do any other work.</P><P>In the last few months, due to heart disease and other physical illness, my earthly tent is again in danger of collapsing at any moment. Many times I tarry at the fork of the road, not knowing what way to take. Humanly speaking, in many experiences I do not know whether to cry or laugh. But thank the Lord, for the Lord's sake nothing is too difficult and no price is too great. In the eyes of those who trust and obey, a dark, cloudy situation is still a bright and clear sky. Those lines are true: "If there is less of earth joy; give, Lord, more of heaven. Let the spirit praise Thee, though the heart be riven." Your prayer at this time is what I treasure. Thank you. Peace be to you.</P><P>A household slave of Christ<br>Watchman Nee<br>August 8, 1932</P>
