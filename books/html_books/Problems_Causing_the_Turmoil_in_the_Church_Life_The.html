<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of personal fellowship given by Brother Witness Lee to the elders in Canada on August 13-15, 1993 in Anaheim, California.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TURMOIL AND THE COMFORT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE GENERALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to us through Brother Watchman Nee. Throughout the years we have learned that we should not try to unify the saints. At the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States in Elden Hall, Pentecostal people sometimes came among us and spoke in tongues. The leading ones looked to me to do something, but I told them not to do anything. I said that since they are Pentecostal, let them be Pentecostal. If they like to speak in tongues, let them speak in tongues. This is what we mean when we say we need to practice the generality of the church life, as I shared in the book entitled <em>The Speciality, Generality, and Practicality of the Church Life.</em> The messages in that book were given in the summer of 1971.</p>
<p>Because we are not denominational, but general, the brothers who come into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have the liberty to practice what they want. We do not have the control. Every denomination has their particular creed and belief. Based upon their creed and belief, they control people. Among us there is nothing like this. Our trust is in the Lord as the Spirit and the life within the believers. Throughout the years we have given many messages on the Lord as the Spirit living in us that we may enjoy His life to live Him.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul was very general in his practice. He was general to such an extent that he was even convinced by James to go to the temple to help people consummate the Nazarite vow (Acts 21:18-26). On this occasion Paul went too far, so the Lord came in to cause a big tumult to stop him. The Lord would not tolerate his participating in a strict Judaic practice such as the Nazarite vow. The Lord stopped him in order to keep the truth of the gospel clear to the coming generations. However, this does show that Paul was a person who would be so general in the church life.</p>
<p>I have been speaking in the church for sixty-one years, since 1932. Throughout these years I have passed through many things, so the events of the recent turmoil among us were not a new experience to me. Such rebellion and opposition have been repeated throughout the New Testament and throughout our history. Paul was condemned of cheating others (2 Cor. 12:16); the Lord Jesus was cheated; and we have been cheated and falsely condemned. But we still have to practice the generality, and we do not want to do anything to control anyone. Paul did not try to control things and neither do we.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING SIMPLE AND SINGLE IN THE MIDST OF TURMOIL</h2>
<p>Whenever there has been a turmoil, we have learned to be simple by staying with the tree of life and staying away from anything related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The general teaching in Christianity is that if you are going to be a preacher, you need to know the people to whom you are preaching, but our practice is different from this. Sometimes before going out to a certain place, the co-workers asked me what they should do and what I knew about the people there. I told them that if they had the burden from the Lord and felt led of the Lord, they should go and speak what the Lord leads them to speak. They should not try to know anything. It is better not to know things. We have learned that it is best to be simple, single, and uncomplicated, staying away from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>The recent turmoil rose up mainly to put me down. Certain ones decided not only to put me down but also to put me out. Now they are endeavoring to preach their kind of doctrine to accomplish this. They did much in this turmoil, but I did not do anything. From the beginning Brother Nee and I have learned the lesson not to take care of these negative things.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE ECONOMY BEING CARRIED OUT<br />
THROUGH THE SATANIC CHAOS</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul also suffered from confusion, turmoil, and rebellion within the church. In the New Testament there is no perfect church. Rather, the churches in the New Testament are full of problems. What a disappointing situation depicted in 2 Timothy! Paul said there that all of those in Asia had rejected his ministry (1:15). Just a small group of brothers, including Timothy, remained with him to take care of him. But when he was going to be martyred, he was still so strong. He said, &ldquo;I have fought the good fight; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, with which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me in that day...&rdquo; (4:7-8). Paul had the assurance that a crown was prepared for him. He was not disappointed.</p>
<p>Paul fulfilled his commission from the Lord and fully accomplished and consummated his ministry. This is why all the seeking Christians throughout the centuries appreciate his fourteen Epistles. Among the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, the most helpful are Paul&rsquo;s books&mdash;Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, and Hebrews. We are all indebted to Paul.</p>
<p>Brother Nee once told us that among the twelve chosen by the Lord Jesus, there was Judas. If we had been the Lord Jesus, we would never have chosen Judas. All of the twelve whom we would have chosen would have been the top ones. But one of the twelve chosen by the Lord was Judas, the son of perdition (John 17:12). This shows that our suffering today is no different than what the Lord Jesus suffered and what the apostles suffered, especially Paul. In this aspect I love 2 Timothy. It comforts me to the uttermost.</p>
<p>We cannot expect anything better than what Paul experienced in his work. But we need to realize that through all of the degradation and chaotic situations, the church is benefitted. In May of 1992 I gave some messages entitled <em>The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation.</em> We saw in those messages that the chaos from the enemy actually helps God&rsquo;s economy. Without Judas, the Lord could not have been betrayed and delivered into the hand of the Pharisees for His crucifixion to be consummated. The situation with Judas was under God&rsquo;s sovereignty to help Him accomplish His economy. In the same way, through the recent turmoil we have been disciplined, educated, and corrected, and many have been tested, stabilized, and established for the furtherance of God&rsquo;s move in His economy.</p>
<p>Now we need to consider what our attitude should be. First, we should, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace, exercise our spirit to take care of the Lord. Second, we must take care of His Body, the church. We should discern the situation, not expecting everyone to be according to what we feel. At the same time we still should be strong to practice the things which we feel led by the Lord to practice.</p>
<p>I have been speaking for over half a century, and I have passed through many troubles, but I have never changed my vision. Certain ones spread a lie that Witness Lee was all right up to 1984, but from that time Witness Lee changed and his change affected the nature of the recovery. So these ones desired to be the &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; to rescue the recovery out of Witness Lee&rsquo;s change.</p>
<p>In these days we have to be for the Lord&rsquo;s interest by taking care of the Lord and taking care of His Body to discern the real situation. It was not an easy thing for me to publish the book entitled <em>The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion.</em> I considered very much before the Lord whether or not I should release the facts of the rebellious turmoil stirred up by certain ones. Many of the things that happened were a mystery to the saints. According to my discernment in the Lord, I eventually felt burdened to let the saints know. I documented nearly every point in that book by writings and by verbal testimonies.</p>
<p>I put out that book concerning the present rebellion based upon Paul&rsquo;s principle in 2 Timothy, where he mentioned the names of those who damaged the churches and the ministry. He mentioned Hymenaeus and Philetus as ones who overthrew the faith of some (2:17-18), and he mentioned Alexander the coppersmith as one who did many evil things to him and greatly opposed him (4:14-15). What is happening to me is a repetition of what happened to Brother Nee. I saw this when I was with him. The only difference was that Brother Nee was the &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; at that time, so the covering umbrella eventually became the target. Now that the recovery has come abroad to the Western world, I have become the target. One of the rebellious ones said that the real problem among us was &ldquo;the philosophy of a king.&rdquo; This shows that I have become the target of their opposition. They are still trying their best to accomplish their goal.</p>
<p>Following the publication of my book on the present rebellion, the Californian churches published an open letter to tell people that they had suffered much loss in the United States because of the divisions these ones made. These divisive ones conducted a conference in Buena Park, next to Anaheim, without fellowshipping with the churches in the area and set up a divisive table in Anaheim. For the sake of the churches, I was forced to publish <em>The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion,</em> and the elders in the Californian churches were also forced to tell the churches on this globe what these people did in California.</p>
<p>The churches in Canada and the United States were opened to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery through this ministry, but I have suffered. I saw Brother Nee suffer the same kinds of things. In February 1986 I called an urgent elders&rsquo; training in which I stressed the one accord, and I made my teaching very clear (see Elders&rsquo; Training Book 7, <em>One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move).</em> I said that being in the army is different from being a citizen. Not everyone in a country is in the army. Gideon eventually had only three hundred who became his army (Judg. 7:7). I went to Taipei in 1984 because I was burdened for an army to be raised up who would practice the God-ordained way. But I do not have the intention or the expectation for all the saints in the recovery to be the same. I pointed out in the 1986 elders&rsquo; training that if some decide not to take the way of the ministry, they are still members of the church in the recovery. But I also asked these ones not to criticize or oppose, because this would cause trouble and division.</p>
<p>I went to Taipei in 1984 and started the training there in an official way in 1986. When that training was set up, a number of lies and rumors came from abroad. When I spoke on the one accord, some misunderstood me. But regardless of the problems, we still have to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s leading. We also have to exercise our spirit plus the Lord-given wisdom to discern the things of the recent turmoil. We cannot be blind or foolish.</p>
<p>In conclusion we have to see that what we have experienced corresponds to what is recorded in the Bible. We should be comforted by this. But to carry out God&rsquo;s commission and the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we have to be faithful to discern what we should take and what we should not take, what we should go on with and what we should not go on with. We need to let go of all the negative things and go on in a positive way to practice the church life according to the scriptural way. Even if a number of people from other places criticize us, we should not respond to it. Eventually, if something is really of the Lord, it will be vindicated by the Lord, and many will receive the help. When we do something positively, we do not need to promote it. We should simply do it. The churches in Taiwan are simply going on with the Lord positively. They do not promote anything or condemn anyone. I hope that all the churches would follow this example.</p>
<p>My burden is to finish the life-study of the whole Bible. I need another two or three years to do this. I also have a burden to release messages concerning the Spirit and life in the yearly conferences. In the Thanksgiving conference of 1992 we spoke concerning the constitution and building up of the Body of Christ. All the saints need to see this, but regardless of how much you expect that the saints will see, not many shall see. Throughout the centuries, many people have received help from Paul&rsquo;s writings. But eventually what we see today is the great religion of Christianity with Catholicism, Protestantism, and Brethrenism. Still the Lord has gained something, and I believe that His word will not be in vain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S CALL FOR THE OVERCOMERS</h2>
<p>Today the Lord is calling for the overcomers. God did not succeed with the race of Adam, so He went to Abraham. With the Abrahamic race, He did not get what He wanted, so He turned to the church. But throughout the nearly two thousand years of church history, the church has failed the Lord. Thus, in the last book of the Bible the Lord calls the overcomers. Still the Lord keeps the churches, because in Revelation 2 and 3 He corrected and adjusted the churches. Not all of us in the churches in the recovery will be the overcomers, but our being in the churches in the recovery will strengthen us and help us to be matured to be the overcomers.</p>
<p>Actually, the book of Revelation is a book concerning the overcomers. The man-child in Revelation 12, the firstfruits in chapter fourteen, and the victorious ones standing on the glassy sea in chapter fifteen are the overcomers. We cannot avoid the degradation, the confusion, and the divisions, but we have to be the overcomers. The chaos we have seen among us is exactly according to what the New Testament unveils. But we need to realize that through all the chaos, the Lord will gain the overcomers and consummate His economy.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE INTRINSIC PROBLEMS AMONG US</h1>
<p>In this fellowship I would like to share with you the intrinsic problems among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BRIEF WORD CONCERNING THE HISTORY<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE IN HIS RECOVERY</h2>
<p>At this point I am burdened to share something with you concerning the real history among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Our God is a working God. After He worked to create the universe, He continued to work through different ages. Every age is a dispensation. In each age God&rsquo;s way to work is different. For instance, with Abraham God worked according to His promise. Then in the age of Moses, the age of law, God worked according to the law. God is still working today in this age. We do not believe that we are in an age of silence without God&rsquo;s work. Today we are in an age at the end of God&rsquo;s old creation, and God is surely working.</p>
<p>According to the whole Bible, God works mainly by and with His word. God&rsquo;s working is by His speaking. God created the universe by speaking things into being. He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast (Psa. 33:9). What- ever God spoke, that was it. God&rsquo;s work is God&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>In the recent training on Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, I pointed out that just as there were the twelve tribes of Israel, there have also been twelve tribes among God&rsquo;s New Testament elect, the real &ldquo;Israel of God&rdquo; (Gal. 6:16). Throughout the New Testament age God has spoken to His elect. No doubt, God spoke to the early apostles. Then God spoke to the church fathers, to the martyrs under the Roman Empire, and to the individual reformers from the Roman Empire to the Reformation. Then especially in the Reformation, God spoke to Martin Luther. He continued to speak to the mystics, the Moravian brothers, the British Brethren, the inner-life Christians, the evangelical Christians, and the Pentecostal Christians. Today He is speaking to the twelfth tribe, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, which has recovered the New Testament revelation back to the early apostles. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery may be considered as the tribe of Levi, the tribe which enjoys all of the top, special, and particular portions of the other eleven tribes. We are enjoying all of the experiences of Christ in the other eleven tribes, including the early apostles, the church fathers, the martyrs, the reformers, the Protestants, the mystics, the Moravians, the Brethren, the inner-life Christians, the evangelicals, and the Pentecostals.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery with us began with Brother Watchman Nee. God raised up such a young man in a heathen, pagan, old, conservative country with the biggest race on earth. His speaking shocked all the missionaries. They were amazed that a young Chinese native could speak the word of God in such an extraordinary way. God used him to speak among us for thirty years, from 1922 to 1952, the year in which he was imprisoned.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INTRINSIC PROBLEMS AMONG US</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Recognizing God&rsquo;s Speaking</h2>
<p>The first of the problems today among us is concerning the recognition of God&rsquo;s speaking. I never told others not to speak and that I am the only speaker. I never said that my ministry is unique. I made it clear repeatedly by my writings that when we say &ldquo;the ministry,&rdquo; we are referring to the New Testament ministry, not just my ministry. If my ministry is a part of that ministry, thank God for this. The problems among us firstly are because we neglect God&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Recognizing the Leadership</h2>
<p>There is also the problem among us of not recognizing the leadership. In every age of the work of God through His speaking, there has been a leader. At the time of the law, Moses was the leader. After Moses, Joshua became the leader. Actually, the leadership is not the person. The leadership is God&rsquo;s speaking. All the people in the age of the law did not actually follow Moses. Practically speaking, they followed the word of God spoken by Moses. I was there with Brother Nee. We always took him as the authority because God&rsquo;s word came to us through him. Thus, it was not he that took the lead but God&rsquo;s speaking. The word of God is the leadership.</p>
 <p>About fifteen years ago, all the churches on this earth respected the leadership of God&rsquo;s speaking. But there was a rebellion which put the leadership under a question mark. The ones who took the lead in this recent rebellion not only put a question mark on the leadership; they have also done their best and are still doing their best to overthrow the leadership.</p>
<p>When I was in mainland China, Brother Nee was the target of all the attacks. Today it is difficult for me to speak, because I am the target. The leadership among us has been neglected, and some even desire to overthrow it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Trying to Do One&rsquo;s Own Work<br />
within the Recovery</h2>
<p>The third problem began from Brother Nee&rsquo;s time. A number of saints accept the recovery and come into the recovery, but they try to do their own work in the recovery. One co-worker tried to promote, to push, his ministry, but the churches around him would not take it. The leading ones there said that apparently the churches there were built up by that co-worker, but actually they were built up by the element of Brother Lee&rsquo;s ministry. I called a number of urgent elders&rsquo; trainings because I realized that there was the tendency of division among us due to some who had the desire to do their own work within the recovery. They use the &ldquo;good will,&rdquo; the advantages, of the recovery to do their own work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Practice of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery<br />
Not Being Strong</h2>
<p>Another problem among us has been that our practice of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was not that strong. In our practice of the church life, we neglected the basic truths of the recovery. We care for the condition but not for the foundation. We do not stress and practice the crucial points of the basic truths in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, such as the experience of the processed Divine Trinity, the enjoyment of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, the full and adequate application of the consummated, all-inclusive Spirit, the strict attention to the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, the proper practice of the local churches on the proper local ground, etc. This is the fatal weakness in our practice of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We should be more than strong and strict in the above-listed items of the basic truths in carrying out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Caring for the Discipline</h2>
<p>The fifth problem is that we do not care for the discipline. The discipline is to turn away from the troublemakers. Besides the opposition outside of us, there has been turmoil within. Since certain ones are trying to make divisions among us and trying to cause others to stumble, what shall we do? We should, according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching, turn away from them and not tolerate them. This was the reason I was forced to put out <em>The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion.</em></p>
<p>In the Old Testament there is the type of leprosy. Moses and Aaron&rsquo;s sister became leprous and she was quarantined (Num. 12:9-16). Moses and Aaron had to reject their natural relationship and affection in order to follow God&rsquo;s speaking to deal with Miriam. According to the type of the Old Testament, who is leprous depends upon the decision of the priest, the one who knows the law, the written word, and who also has the present word according to the Urim and Thummim (Lev. 13). For the priest to discern whether or not someone had leprosy was not an easy thing. Someone may have leprosy and others cannot discern it. Another one may have what looks like leprosy, when actually it is not. The proper one who has the written word and the living word has the discernment to judge whether or not someone has leprosy.</p>
<p>In <em>The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion,</em> I mentioned only four names of ones who should be quarantined. The churches in California, West Malaysia, and Taiwan also sent out an open letter to quarantine these ones. In this matter we are touching a great truth, the truth of the Body. Do we honor the Body? The churches in California, West Malaysia, and Taiwan are parts of the Body. Should we not honor them and respect their feeling? But some were not clear and strong to keep the truth to maintain the feeling of the Body, which comprises all the churches.</p>
<p>We must be clear and strong in the truth, and we have to practice the truth. We must practice the truth in Romans 16:17 and Titus 3:10. Whatever we do involves the Body, so we have to keep the truth. The only remedy to the situation is for the faithful ones to come back to the truth. We must be the overcomers, the ones who overcome all these situations. We must come back to the truth to practice the recovery in the way of the recovery according to the Lord&rsquo;s word, not according to what we think or how we feel.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEED TO SEE THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>Most of the saints among us really love the Lord, but the problem is with their seeing of the divine vision. In the recovery we need not merely the knowing but the seeing of a revelation, which has to become a vision to us. The apostle John was the first one who saw the New Jerusalem. In our life-study we pointed out that all the predicates in the book of Revelation are in the past tense. John said, &ldquo;I saw&rdquo; (1:12; 17:3; 21:1-2). He used the past tense because he received visions of accomplished facts. In the eyes of God, the New Jerusalem has been consummated. We know that it has been consummated because John saw it. Year after year in our ministry, we have insisted that we need to see the vision, not just to know it. The problem today among us is that thousands of saints, lovers of Christ, have come into the recovery but they are short of sight. There is no seeing. We talk about the Body, but we have never seen it.</p>
<p>Brother Nee began to speak about the Body from 1939. That was right after he came back from a long visit to Europe. He went there in 1937. Then he came back in 1939. Right after coming back he called an urgent conference. I was traveling in the north, and he cabled me to come to this conference, which began in September 1939. He spoke on the Body of Christ and continued to minister on this subject until 1942.</p>
<p>In 1940 Brother Nee began a training in Shanghai, which I attended. There were just a little over forty trainees in his training. In addition to this training he held a conference about every two months on the Body of Christ. In the training he did not speak much. Instead, he tested the trainees by asking them to give testimonies about their seeing of the Body of Christ. After someone gave a testimony, Brother Nee would criticize it, telling the person that he had never seen the Body. He would tell those who testified that they may have thought that they had seen the Body, but based upon what they said he would show that they had not seen the Body. He told them that what they had received was mere &ldquo;head knowledge,&rdquo; instead of a real seeing of the Body of Christ. Through all of those criticisms, I was helped to see a lot.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is very abstract. Where is the Body of Christ and what is the Body of Christ? How can we see it? It is difficult to find many in church history who really saw the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST REVEALED<br />
TO THE APOSTLE PAUL</h2>
<p>We also need to point out that the Lord Jesus did not touch the Body of Christ in His earthly ministry. This is because the disciples at His time could not bear it. In John 16 the Lord told His disciples that He had many things to say to them which they could not bear, but when the Spirit of reality would come, He would disclose and declare these things to them (vv. 12-13). To whom did the Spirit of reality disclose the Body of Christ? It was to Paul. Among the several writers who wrote parts of the New Testament, only one used the term <em>the Body of Christ</em>&mdash;the apostle Paul. Peter, John, James, and Jude did not touch the Body.</p>
<p>Paul, however, touched it not just by chapters but by books. The first book in which he touched the Body of Christ is Romans. It is not until chapter twelve of this book that he speaks directly of the Body of Christ. In verse 5 he says, &ldquo;So we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.&rdquo; He spoke more about the Body in 1 Corinthians. Chapters twelve and fourteen of this book are two long chapters concerning the Body of Christ in detail. He did not say anything about the Body of Christ in 2 Corinthians, nor did he touch it in Galatians. But he was on the Body of Christ once again in Ephesians.</p>
<p>In chapter four of Ephesians the Body of Christ is disclosed in a marvelous, wonderful way. Verses 4 through 6 speak of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father. This is a divine and human, organic constitution. The believers are the Body, the frame. Within this frame there is the Triune God as the very essence, element, and source for His divine constitution with humanity. The Triune God&mdash;the Spirit, the Lord, and God the Father&mdash;has been constituted organically with His chosen people in their humanity. This divine-human constitution becomes the universal Body of Christ. Verses 7 through 16 of Ephesians 4 go on to reveal the functioning of the gifts to perfect the saints to do the work of the ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ, and they unveil the growth and building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The human body is a picture of the Body of Christ. It is hard for us to know what the Body of Christ is, but it is easier, in a sense, to know our physical body. Medical doctors can tell us that in the whole universe among God&rsquo;s creation, the most wonderful, marvelous, and excellent thing is the human body. The human body is an organism. It is not something organized but something constituted with life. One top medical doctor told me in 1938 that the human body was so complete and complex that no one could understand it thoroughly. Our human body is a marvelous organism, a picture of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God.</p>
<p>When we use the terms <em>organism</em> or <em>organic,</em> we come to the matter of life. In the Greek text of the New Testament, there are three kinds of life. <em>Bios</em> refers to our physical life, and <em>psuche</em> refers to our soulish life. Then there is the Greek word <em>zoe.</em> The New Testament uses this word to denote the divine life. We did not have <em>zoe</em> before we were saved, but we had <em>bios</em> and <em>psuche,</em> the physical life and the psychological life. The Body of Christ is an organism constituted with the divine life, the life of the processed and consummated Triune God.</p>
<p>Some Christian teachers said that our human body is real and that the Body of Christ is just a figure of speech. They were wrong. Actually, our body is a picture, a figure, and a type of the real body, which is Christ&rsquo;s Body (Rom. 12:4-5). For us to understand what the Body of Christ is, God created a human body. The human body is a figure. It is not the real body. The real body is Christ&rsquo;s Body. The Body of Christ is not a figure or a type but a reality. Since our human body is a mystery, how much more is the Body of Christ a mystery! No one can fully explain it. The five problems among us which we have covered in the previous message are due to the shortage of sight concerning the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE VISION OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>Have you noticed that today in the entire realm of Christianity, including Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, the word <em>economy</em> is not being used? The worldly people use this word to refer to the monetary economy, but this is not the way the holy Scriptures use this word. The word <em>economy</em> is anglicized from the Greek word <em>oikonomia. Oikos</em> means house or household and <em>nomos</em> means law. Thus <em>economy</em> means a kind of household law, or administration. Only the apostle Paul used this word. It is used in Ephesians 1:10; 3:2, and 9; 1 Corinthians 9:17; Colossians 1:25; and 1 Timothy 1:4. The word <em>oikonomia</em> in these places is translated into either &ldquo;economy&rdquo; or &ldquo;stewardship.&rdquo; With God His economy is His eternal administration, His eternal plan. But with Paul it became a kind of stewardship, a dispensing service. God&rsquo;s economy is His house law, His household administration. This household administration refers to God&rsquo;s divine plan with a certain arrangement for His administration. Now we have to ask what God&rsquo;s plan is for. For soul-winning? For people to be spiritual? This is far off.</p>
<p>I began to speak for the Lord in 1932, and the next year I got caught by the Lord to give up my job and serve Him full-time. I have spent much time, over half a century, with much labor and energy to study the Bible. The notes in the old Bibles I have show how much I have labored in the Word throughout the years. Many of these notes have been incorporated into our Recovery Version of the New Testament and our Life-study of the New Testament. One of the notes in the first English Bible I used when I came to the United States says, &ldquo;The central thought of God is to have Christ as His expression through the church. Christ as God&rsquo;s expression through the church which is His Body is the central thought of the whole Scripture. The record of the first two chapters of the Scriptures is the blueprint of God&rsquo;s plan, and that of the last two chapters is a picture of God&rsquo;s work through all the generations according to His plan.&rdquo; Another note in this Bible in the first chapter of the book of John says, &ldquo;The Lamb is for delivering us from sin, for separation from sin on the negative side. The dove is for joining us to God for union with God on the positive side. A dove on the Lamb is a spiritual picture comprehending the full interpretation of the whole Scriptures.&rdquo; My point is this&mdash;the accumulation of the knowledge of this divine book with me has been lasting for sixty-eight years, and this is the source of today&rsquo;s Life-study. Our Life-study of the Bible has still not been exhausted. Eventually, our study has brought us to the revelation of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>We need to see that God&rsquo;s economy as God&rsquo;s plan, His administration, is to create, to constitute, and to produce a Body for His Son. This is the major purpose of God&rsquo;s economy. Christ gained this Body, which is a part of Himself, His counterpart. Adam living alone typifies Christ being alone before He had gained His counterpart, His Body, the church. God said it was not good for Adam to be alone. So God made him fall into a deep sleep, opened his side, and took out a rib. Genesis 2 says that God built a woman with that rib (v. 22). This indicates that Eve came out of Adam. After being built up, Eve was brought back to Adam, and God made these two into one flesh. Ephesians 5 tells us that this is a type of the great mystery of Christ and the church (vv. 31-32). This type will be fulfilled in the New Jerusalem, which is the wife of the Lamb (Rev. 21:2). This is the goal of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The sixty-six books of the Bible all consummate in one city. Every book has its conclusion, and the conclusion of the entire Scriptures is a city, the New Jerusalem. Every crucial point concerning the New Jerusalem was mentioned already in the Bible. At the end of Ezekiel, there is the city of Jerusalem with a river flowing out of the house of God. Thus, the river we see flowing in the New Jerusalem is not something new. The golden lampstands are mentioned in Revelation 1 and 2, and the New Jerusalem is the consummate lampstand. The lampstand is first mentioned in Exodus 25 and again in Zechariah 4. All the positive things in the Old Testament and the New Testament will eventually be collected and condensed together in one entity, the New Jerusalem. This is what God wants. The Triune God is embodied and crystallized in the New Jerusalem, and this is the consummation of the Body of Christ, the counterpart of Christ, the wife of Christ, the organism of the Triune God.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is constituted with the Triune God, so we can see the Triune God there. God the Father is there as the shining One (Rev. 22:5), Christ is there as the tree of life (v. 2), and the Spirit is there as the river of water of life (v. 1). God is the shining One, Christ is the growing One, and the Spirit is the flowing One. This is the Triune God flowing to saturate, to soak, the entire New Jerusalem. This soaking, this saturating, carries out the divine constitution with the redeemed humanity, and this divine-human constitution is the Body of Christ. This is the purpose of God&rsquo;s economy, positively speaking.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy does have another aspect on the negative side, and that aspect is the destruction of God&rsquo;s enemy. God has a unique enemy which He could destroy by Himself, but He would not do it. He desires to do it through His redeemed people. Therefore, the redeemed humanity should cooperate with God to destroy Satan. The book of Revelation shows that on the one hand, the overcomers will become the consummated New Jerusalem, and on the other hand, all the overcomers will be used to destroy Satan. These are the two aspects concerning the Body of Christ in the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s desire for His expression and the destruction of Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">DIFFERENT TEACHINGS OTHER THAN GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>In the recent turmoil, some began to teach different things other than God&rsquo;s economy (1 Tim. 1:3-4). They were teaching that the local church should he autonomous. This wrong teaching comes from G. H. Lang&rsquo;s book <em>The Churches of God.</em> In the spring of 1988, certain ones worked together to spread this book. How can the local churches of the Body of Christ be autonomous? Just as no part of our human body can be autonomous in relation to the other parts, none of the churches of the Body of Christ can be autonomous in relation to the other churches.</p>
<p>The ones who took the lead in the recent turmoil also taught that after the apostles established the churches and set up the elders, they kept their hands off of the churches and elders which they established. This is a wrong and different teaching. The Bible tells us that Paul established the church at Ephesus. Then he visited the saints there and wrote letters to them for their perfecting. Acts 20 tells us that Paul once stayed with them for three years and that he taught them publicly in the meetings and from house to house day and night with tears (vv. 20, 31). Surely Paul did not keep his hands off of the churches which he established or the leading ones whom he appointed. In his book entitled <em>Church Affairs,</em> Brother Nee pointed out that the workers need to give help to the elders by teaching them and training them, based upon the apostle Paul&rsquo;s example (pp. 14-16). For some to say that the apostles should keep their hands off of the churches and the elders means that they have not seen the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Actually, the ones among us who rebelled were bothered because they wanted to achieve something. This meant that they wanted to be somebody in the recovery. We have been selected by God and called out by God from the world, and we have given up everything for Christ. We do not want to be somebody or to achieve something for ourselves. To us all things other than Christ are dung, dregs, rubbish, and dog food (Phil. 3:8).</p>
<p>We need to be the overcomers, the ones who overcome all the negative things. The Lord has been delayed because He still needs some who will pay the price to be His overcomers. He told us clearly that He would come quickly. Of course, to Him one thousand years is like one day (2 Pet. 3:8). But still the Lord has not come back, because we have delayed Him. He needs the overcomers to carry out the economy of God to have a Body and to destroy His unique enemy. This is exactly why the book of Revelation was written.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>First, we need to see the economy of God. Then we have to see the Body of Christ. Strictly speaking, what God is seeking after is a Body for Christ. The twenty-three verses of Ephesians 1 issue in the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. Christ as the One who fills all in all needs the church to be His fullness for His complete expression. Christ is not only the all-inclusive One but also the all-extensive One because He fills all in all. Such a Christ needs a Body as His counterpart for His expression.</p>
<p>Ephesians tells us clearly that the church, the gathering of God&rsquo;s called-out ones, is not an organization but an organism, the Body of Christ. We have to see this. The Body is universally one. It has only one God who is of three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Ephesians 4 reveals that all three have been constituted into this organism.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Body is a constitution, but on the other hand, it is a building. This building is not by stones or bricks which cannot grow. This building is by the increase of the organic Triune God in the believers who grow up into Christ the Head in all things (Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15). The Body is constituted with the Triune God and is built up by growing (v. 16). We all have to grow into our Head, Christ, in everything. Ephesians 4:16 says that the Body builds itself up by growth. All of the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</p>
<p>If we see the Body, we will not be able to make any trouble in the recovery. We will not be concerned about who is wrong or who is right. Actually, if we make trouble, we are automatically wrong. We have been forced to quarantine certain divisive ones who have caused trouble among us. Anyone who knows the Body would never do the things which these ones have done and are doing.</p>
<p>Turmoil after turmoil has transpired because of our not knowing the Body. The only remedy that can cure us of this kind of illness is the seeing of the Body. When Brother Nee taught about the Body he said that with whatever we do, we have to consider how the churches would feel about it. When we do something, we must not forget that we are members of the Body, and the Body is not only a local church. The local church is not a &ldquo;local body&rdquo;; if it is, it becomes a local sect. The Body is the Body of Christ, constituted by the Triune God with all the believers on this earth, with all the local churches.</p>
<p>Both the ministry and many churches in the recovery made a decision to quarantine certain divisive ones. Some did not accept this decision and have even joined these divisive ones. They have disregarded the feeling of the Body. How we behave ourselves depends upon the degree of our seeing of the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORDER IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Body has its proper order. Some may not be happy to be under the &ldquo;eyes.&rdquo; They may want to be above the eyes, but this is their design not God&rsquo;s design. In 1 Corinthians 12:18 Paul said, &ldquo;God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed.&rdquo; No one can change the position of any member of the Body. The little finger is under the hand, the hand is under the arm, and the arm is under the shoulder. This is the order in the Body of Christ. If we consider ourselves to be more than what we actually are, this is not according to the Body. If someone says that he is an apostle, we need to ask what church was established by him. An apostle must be one who preaches the gospel to save sinners, who forms and establishes churches, and who discerns and teaches the truth.</p>
<p>We are the Body, and in the Body there is an order. Brother Nee once used the order in a family as an illustration. A family has the father, the mother, and the children. A child in the family knows the order in his family. He knows who is above, or before, him and who is below, or after, him. In like manner, the Body has an order. Humanly speaking and spiritually speaking, we should fellowship about the Lord&rsquo;s interests with the ones who are more mature than us and who are ahead of us. Then we may say that we know the Body.</p>
<p>I believe that this fellowship is the proper diagnosis of our situation. The remedy is only one&mdash;we need to see and know the Body, and we have to honor the Body. We cannot be healed by any other way. In order to practice the truth, we need to see the Body. We stand on the ground of the church because of the Body. There is only one Body in the universe. Therefore, the expression of this one Body must be a unique local church in a city. There cannot be more than one expression of the one Body in a locality. This is the truth which we must practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE BODY LIFE BY RECEIVING<br />
THE BELIEVERS AND TURNING AWAY<br />
FROM THOSE WHO MAKE DIVISIONS</h2>
<p>There was a big debate among the Brethren concerning the receiving of the saints. This is why there are today&rsquo;s Closed Brethren and Open Brethren. Both the Closed and the Open Brethren are partially right. On the one hand, we can accept and we should accept the real Christians, but we cannot strengthen or justify their denominations. This was, has been, and still is our attitude. We say that we love all the dear saints in the denominations, but we cannot confirm or justify the denominations. Denominations are wrong, and there are many evil things there. Any kind of hierarchy is an evil thing in the Lord&rsquo;s sight. To build up the clerical class and thus annul the functions of the members of the Body of Christ is evil in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>Our attitude depends upon our seeing of the Body. The only remedy is to see the Body of Christ. It is not a matter of yes or no, good or bad. It is a matter of whether or not something is of the Body or not of the Body. We must be Body-conscious to the uttermost. What the Lord wants is the Body. But today not many really care for the Body.</p>
<p>When we accept someone at the Lord&rsquo;s table, we have to consider the Body. According to the principle of Romans 14, we accept all of the Lord&rsquo;s children, but according to Romans 16:17 we have to mark those who make divisions and turn away from them. We cannot receive division-makers who have been quarantined by the Body. Furthermore, we have to realize who has the function and qualification as the priest to discern leprosy among the Lord&rsquo;s children. Again this is a matter of practicing the Body life. If a local church receives someone who has offended the Body to the uttermost, that local church is obviously not going along with and not one with the Body. We have to take care of the Body.</p>
<p>In a sense, we may say that a local church is autonomous only to a certain degree in practical and business affairs. Whether a local church should buy a piece of land to build a hall or rent a hail is according to their discernment. But receiving a person who has made trouble in the recovery and who is still making trouble involves the Body very much. If we behave ourselves properly, we are okay in the Body. But if we commit something that is condemned by the New Testament, the Body has the right to say something. The Body surely will check with a local church if there is a division-maker among them whom they have not disciplined. If they do not discipline such a one, they are wrong and are offending the Body.</p>
<p>To know the Body is the proper recovery of the Lord. If we are for the recovery, we need to realize what the recovery is. The Lord desires to recover the missed Body of Christ and to recover the neglected oneness of the Body of Christ. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING ASIDE OUR NATURAL RELATIONSHIPS<br />
AND PRACTICING THE TRUTH OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>We need to put aside all our natural relationships when it comes to practicing the truth of Romans 16:17, that is, turning away from those who make divisions. If a relative of ours is making divisions or living in sin, it would be wrong to allow him to participate in the Lord&rsquo;s table. What if a brother&rsquo;s father is living with a concubine? He may say, &ldquo;How can I reject my father?&rdquo; Surely he still needs to respect and honor his father, but he cannot bring this family regulation into the church life. He still has to practice the truth by taking care of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The book of Acts tells us that Barnabas made a mistake because of his natural relationship with Mark, his cousin (Col. 4:10). He wanted to take his cousin, but Paul would not agree with this (Acts 15:35-39). Barnabas was wrong. He should have gone along with Paul. After Barnabas separated from Paul in Acts 15, his name is no longer mentioned in the record of God&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much help we have received from a certain one in the past, if he does something that offends the Body, we must practice the truth. We must know the Body and trust in the Body. The churches in California wrote an open letter because they felt burdened and were held responsible to let the churches on this globe know the damage certain ones did in California and the loss which they had suffered. In this open letter they said that they had made the decision to quarantine these ones. Should we listen to the churches or take care of our own personal observation of the situation? If we put the notification of so many churches aside and go to investigate the situation for ourselves, this is an offending to the Body. Do we respect the Body or do we respect ourselves?</p>
<p>It is not a matter of whether someone is right or wrong. He might be right, but still he offended the Body. We need to see the Body. What the Lord wants is the Body, not a bunch of saved souls. Soul-winning is right; soul-winning is good; but soul-winning should not be for soul-winning. The Lord wants souls for the building up of the Body of Christ. We must see the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">A CONCLUDING WORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE MUTUAL PROFIT BETWEEN THE BODY<br />
AND THE LOCAL CHURCHES</h2>
<p>We need to see the profit of the Body to the local churches and the profit of the local churches to the Body. We can use a family as an illustration of this. On the one hand, the father is for the members of his family, and on the other hand, the members of the family are for the father. If we do not have a father, we are orphans. An orphan does not receive the profit, the benefit, from a father, so he suffers a lot. But a man who does not have any children also suffers. This is a good illustration of how the Body of Christ is the source of the local churches. Such a universal Body is like the father to all the churches, and all the churches are like the children to the father.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the profit from the Body of Christ to a local church. Many of the members in a local church may not actually be saved directly by that church. Instead, they are saved elsewhere and come from other localities. This is the benefit from the Body to that local church. This is the profit from the &ldquo;father&rdquo; to his &ldquo;child.&rdquo; Some among us enjoyed the inheritance from the Body, but then they gave up the Body and would not care for the Body. They have caused divisions, and divisions are a part of degraded Christianity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HARLOTRY OF DIVISION</h2>
<p>According to the book of Revelation, the Catholic church, which is a great part of Christianity, has become a great harlot. In Revelation 17 the harlot is a mother who has daughters, and these daughters are also harlots (vv. 1, 5). A harlot is a woman who has many men and no definite husband. The denominations have taken many names (such as Lutheran, Wesleyan, Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc.) other than the name of our Husband, the Lord Jesus Christ. This means that they do not have a definite husband. To denominate the church by taking any name other than the Lord&rsquo;s is spiritual fornication. The church, as the pure virgin espoused to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2), should have no name other than her Husband&rsquo;s. Any division among the believers is a harlot.</p>
<p>Rahab was a harlot but she turned from her harlotry to God&rsquo;s people, and she married the proper husband. She was alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and had nothing to do with all the promises of God as mentioned in Ephesians 2:12, but she turned to the people of Israel. Then she became no longer a harlot but a wife of a definite Israelite whose name was Salmon. As a result, Rahab became one of the important ancestors to bring forth Christ (Matt. 1:5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE BODY, KNOWING THE BODY,<br />
AND CARING FOR THE BODY</h2>
<p>When I was a young man, the Lord used me to raise up a church in my hometown of Chefoo. One evening the leaders of the denominations there invited me to have dinner with them. They complimented me for being zealous for the Lord&rsquo;s gospel and for bringing many people to the Lord. But they said that they could not agree with me setting up a church. Instead, they proposed that I go to their various denominations in the town to preach and to teach each Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>I asked them if they believed that the divisions in Corinth were justified by Paul. Paul said, &ldquo;Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ. Is Christ divided?...For when someone says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men of flesh?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:12-13a; 3:4). All of these divisive ones were condemned by Paul. I then asked them, &ldquo;What if Paul were here with us today? Would he justify your condition?&rdquo; They said that he would not. Then I said that I could not maintain anything which God condemned. I asked them where I should put the new believers whom I gained as a result of my preaching of the gospel. I surely could not send them to their denominations, since they are condemned by God. This forced me to set up a meeting hall to take care of the new believers. Then I told them that if they took away all the signs which designated them as denominations, I would close the door to our meeting hall that night. They said that it was impossible for them to do this. I responded by saying, &ldquo;Then you bear the responsibility for division, not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we said in the previous chapter, all the problems are due to one thing&mdash;not knowing the Body. Some in the churches are self-appointed elders. They may say that the Holy Spirit appointed them, but the Bible does not say that the elders are appointed merely by the Holy Spirit. The Bible says that the apostles appointed the elders and that eventually the Spirit recognized that appointment (Acts 14:23; 20:28).</p>
<p>I want to say again that whenever we do something, we must have a proper consideration for the Body. We need to consider how the Body would feel about what we are doing. The biggest problem, the unique problem, is not knowing the Body and not caring for the Body. If we take care of the Body and are concerned for the Body, there will be no problems.</p>
<p>We are here for the Body. Without the backing of the Body, without the backing of the recovery, we have no way to practice the local churches. If we practice the local church life and neglect the view of the Body, our local church becomes a local sect.</p>
<p>The recovery is for the Body, not for any individual or merely for any individual local church. If we are going to do something, we have to consider how the Body, the recovery, will react. The problems are all due to the lack of seeing the Body and of caring for the Body. We all need to come back to the truth, and to practice the truth is to take care of the Body. Sometimes the Body is strong, and sometimes the Body is weak, but it is still the Body. If we come back to the truth and take care of the proper order in the Body, the Body will immediately become stronger. All the problems are due to one thing: not seeing, not knowing, and not caring for the Body. We have to honor the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM OF AMBITION</h2>
<p>Those who took the lead in the recent turmoil did not care for the Body. They also misunderstood us. Such misunderstanding comes mostly from ambition. If a person did not have any ambition in a certain matter, he would not have any misunderstanding. If a person desires to gain something for himself and does not get it, he may feel that he has been mistreated. Actually, he was not mistreated by others, but was misled by his own ambition. The problem here is the desire to achieve something for themselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING A RESOLUTION TO BE<br />
AN OVERCOMER, A VITAL PERSON,<br />
TO CARRY OUT THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h2>
<p>We must resolve to deny ourselves and be the overcomers for the Lord, for the recovery, and for the Body. We need such a resolution. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I know You need the overcomers. Without the overcomers, You have no way to go on. Lord, I want to be one of these overcomers.&rdquo; The overcomers see the Body, know the Body, and care for the Body.</p>
<p>We have to make a strong resolution. In Judges 5 Deborah highly appraised some of those in the tribe of Reuben among the people of Israel. She said that they made a definite resolution to fight for the Lord&rsquo;s people (v. 15). Judges also tells us that God selected three hundred to be Gideon&rsquo;s army based upon how they drank water. The three hundred who lapped the water into their mouth with their hand did not care for their necessities, while the others who bowed down on their knees to drink the water did (7:4-7). The overcomers are those who care for God&rsquo;s interests above everything, including their necessities.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we have to make our standing clear that we do not agree with the divisions made by certain division-makers. This will help to calm down the situation among all the churches. On the other hand, we have to pick up a strong resolution by praying, &ldquo;Lord, I&rsquo;m going to mean business to live You for Your recovery, for the building up of Your Body. Lord, this is my job. This is my goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must be vital persons. We must practice visiting people for the gospel once a week for two hours. Suppose that you pick up a resolution by praying, &ldquo;Lord, I am on this earth for Your recovery, for Your Body. Your Body needs the human members for Your divine constitution. If I don&rsquo;t go out to get sinners saved to become Your members, then how could Your Body be built up? My going out is not for soul-winning. I am not for that. I am for Your Body. I have to go out to get members for Your Body.&rdquo; After making such a resolution before the Lord, you can begin to contact people for two hours every week. There are many ways to contact people and many places you can go. You may go out week after week and gain no one until the end of the year. At that time, you may meet a man while you are standing in line at the bank, and as a result you may gain him and his entire family. If you go out faithfully and consistently every week for two hours, you surely can gain one person as remaining fruit in a year.</p>
<p>Not all the saints are able to practice this consistent labor in the gospel because of various circumstances and weaknesses, but perhaps forty out of one hundred can. If thirty of these gain one a year, this will yield a thirty percent increase. In this way it would be easy for a local church to gain a thirty percent increase every year. The Lord said that the seed sown on the good earth bears fruit and produces either a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold (Matt. 13:23).</p>
<p>A thirty percent yearly increase would be the highest in the history of Christianity. Do you believe that you can go out two hours each week, fifty-two times a year, and not gain one person? I believe that anyone who would do this would gain one person a year. To knock on doors means to contact people by any possible way.</p>
<p>We must be vital in order to gain sinners for the Lord. After we gain them, we need to feed them. To feed the new believers is even harder than gaining them. Then we have to perfect them by the mutual asking and answering of questions, the mutual teaching, in the group meetings. In order to do this effectively, we have to learn the truths. The recent life-study on Joshua, Judges, and Ruth did not come to me by accident. It came from over a half of a century of studying the Bible and accumulating the truth in the Bible. I am sharing this to impress us that we have to pay the price to learn the truths.</p>
<p>We need to gather the new ones together to form a little vital group, to mutually ask questions and mutually answer one another for the mutual teaching. The new ones cannot do this, so we have to set up a pattern for them by asking the proper questions. We may ask, &ldquo;What is the first thing a believer should do after his baptism?&rdquo; They will not know how to answer this, so we have to answer for them to set up a pattern. After we do this a number of times, they will learn how to ask and how to answer. This means that we need to pay the price to learn the truth and to learn how to speak. Then we need to help the new ones to practice the church meeting by prophesying to build up the Body. This is very high, but it is practical and workable. Whether or not we carry this out depends upon our willingness to pay the price to do it.</p>
<p>The Lord is a working God. He is still working today in His own way, and He needs people. We must enter into the intrinsic significance of the holy Scriptures to find out what the Lord says and what He wants. We have no right to invent anything. Rather, we discover things in the Bible. We should aspire to be patterns to the coming generation. Then the Lord will have a way. Otherwise He cannot have a way to build up His Body and to defeat His enemy, to destroy Satan. Satan is still working on this earth, walking about as a roaring lion and seeking someone to devour (1 Pet. 5:8). He is also active in the heavens (Job 1:6). Revelation shows that God is waiting for the overcomers to defeat him (12:10-11). Christianity cannot fulfill this work for God. Even the church life in the recovery carried out in a routine way cannot accomplish God&rsquo;s desire. The Lord needs the overcomers.</p></body></html>
