   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STUDENTS BEING BALANCED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not force the students to attend meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is no need to compel the students to join any meetings of the church; rather, we should work on them until it is their desire to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then their attendance will not be a matter of compliance to our demand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The serving ones must help the students to allocate time for their studies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The students must study diligently, and we should encourage them to spend time studying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should work with each student according to his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In principle, the students should be able to set aside two hours a week for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No matter how busy a student is, he needs other activities for relaxation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every human being has a need for enjoyment, and when the students attend the meetings, this need will be met.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The students also need to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They should not merely come to meet for enjoyment but also to receive practical help.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The serving ones must find the best way for the students to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They do not necessarily have to bring the students to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must be very flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The students who attend night school can have a meeting during the day, and other students can have a meeting at night.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, the students do not have to wait until the Lord s Day in order to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They can meet any day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should exercise to be flexible in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TEARING DOWN REGIONALISM</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>AND BEING COORDINATED</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A brother asked whether district one should coordinate with district three.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes there is a need for coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, coordination should not be organizational or formal; it should be living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must tear down any sense of regionalism and not become isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The districts should be open; we should never say that a particular area belongs to district one and that another area belongs to district three.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not designate a school as belonging to one district and another school to another district.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This concept must be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We belong to the same local church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would be very sad if we cannot tear down a sense of regionalism related to the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A co-worker serving in a district should not think that the result of his work belongs to that district.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must drop this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At present, those serving in a district have difficulty coordinating with other districts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the work, however, we must not limit the students.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the students feel to serve on the campus of National Taiwan University, they should have the freedom to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If they feel to serve in district one, they should also have the freedom to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether the result of our service is manifested in a school or in a district does not matter, because the result belongs to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, the serving ones from different areas of the work can fellowship without prejudice concerning the service of a student.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is nothing difficult to resolve.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The only thing that needs to be resolved is selfish intentions that result in regionalism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regionalism must be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This applies to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not set up separating walls between the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>HAVING AN ENLARGED VIEW AND</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>PRODUCING USEFUL SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope that you will bring these matters of fellowship before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must learn how to apply these matters and be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The basic principle is to produce useful saints, and we should be flexible in everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, there should not be any differences between the churches or between the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There should be absolutely no distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even if I am serving in a district, I should be able to help another district.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The elders should have a broadened view.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not say that since a serving one is assigned to my district, he should not help in another district.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our view must be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the Lord s blessing will be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The basic principle is to work to produce useful saints who can carry out the work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must also work with the elementary school students, because they will be gospel seeds in junior high school, high school, and college.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we gain the young people as gospel seeds, the work will multiply and increase in every level of education.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the co-workers work in this way, the work will go on unhindered and without limitation.</S>
