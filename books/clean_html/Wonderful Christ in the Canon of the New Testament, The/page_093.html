<h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL AND LOCAL BUILDING IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Then Paul tells us that we &ldquo;are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are being builded together into an habitation of God in spirit&rdquo; (Eph. 2:20-22, Gk.). In these verses we see that all Christians are fitly framed together to grow into an holy temple in the Lord. This is the universal aspect. But Paul also practically covers the local aspect. He says that we also are being built together locally into an habitation of God in spirit. This local building is now under the process. &ldquo;Ye also are <em>being</em> builded together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many teachers in Christianity say that it is impossible to have the building now. They say that this will be in the future. But I cannot find such a teaching in the Bible. The church is not to be built in the future. The next age will be the dispensation of the kingdom. That will not be the church age. The church age is today! Ye also as local saints in your locality are being builded together into an habitation of God in spirit. This is something in our spirit. It is not through the Holy Spirit as translated by the King James Version. The Holy Spirit is the dweller, not the dwelling place. Our spirit is the dwelling place and the Holy Spirit is the dweller.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S FARM FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>Paul continues to tell us in 1 Corinthians 3 that we are God&rsquo;s farm to grow Christ, and we are God&rsquo;s building. &ldquo;Ye are God&rsquo;s farm, ye are God&rsquo;s building&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:9b, Gk.). Whatever is grown on God&rsquo;s farm is for God&rsquo;s building. Christ is the foundation, and we are not only the materials, but also the builders. Therefore, we must be careful which materials we use for the building. &ldquo;For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble...&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:11-12). We must build with gold, silver, and precious stones. This is the same as in Genesis 2. God&rsquo;s intention from Genesis to Revelation is to obtain such a building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>In the book of Revelation, John gives us the full consummation of the Bible. It is the harvest of all the seeds in the divine Word. The seed of the tree of life was sown in Genesis, but the harvest of the tree of life is at the end of Revelation. Gold, pearl, and precious stones are sown in Genesis as a seed, but they are reaped in a city built up with these precious materials at the end of Revelation. Revelation is the reaping of all the things sown in the Bible. Jesus, Peter, and Paul all spoke about the building, but what they spoke was not the harvest. John reaped the building in the book of Revelation. How marvelous is the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22! This is not a heavenly mansion as poor Christianity teaches. It is the consummation of God&rsquo;s building!</p>
<h2 class="head1">A UNIVERSAL GOLDEN LAMPSTAND</h2>
<p>Now we must see something in detail concerning the New Jerusalem. The city proper is a mountain. Its height is twelve thousand furlongs (Rev. 21:16). The number is meaningful. This is one thousand times twelve. We have seen that twelve is the mingling of three and four, which means the mingling of God and man. So the New Jerusalem is the mingling of God with man one thousand times. The length and the breadth and the height are equal (Rev. 21:16). They are all twelve thousand furlongs. The city is a big mountain with God&rsquo;s throne on the top. Out of the throne the living water is flowing. At the bottom of the mountain a wall is built which is 144 cubits high (Rev. 21:17). This is twelve times twelve. The height of the wall is not too high, but the height of the city proper is twelve thousand furlongs. This mountain is all of gold, the ultimate consummation of all the golden lampstands. The seven lampstands are local, and this golden lampstand is universal. The New Jerusalem is a universal golden lampstand, holding the Lamb as the lamp shining out the glory of God (Rev. 21:23). God as the light is in Christ as the lamp shining out from the top of this universal golden lampstand.</p>
