   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the Means for Him to Cast Out Demons</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 12:28 the Lord Jesus says, "If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This word indicates that Christ fought the battle for the kingdom by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit of God is the power of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where the Spirit of God is in power, there the kingdom of God is, and there the demons have no ground.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Wherever the Spirit of God exercises authority over the opposing situation, that is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, the Spirit was the means and the power for Christ to cast out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Testifying concerning Christ</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Another aspect of the Spirit's work is to testify concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 15:26 says, "When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see that the Spirit, sent by the Son and coming with the Father, will testify concerning the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After Christ's resurrection, the Spirit, as Christ's living witness, began to testify of Christ's reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit as the Spirit of the resurrected Christ comes to testify concerning the Son and to glorify Him John 16:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the transfiguration of the Son, the Spirit makes the Son real to the believers in their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is to testify concerning the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Apart from the Spirit's testifying, the Son would be merely objective to the believers and could not be subjective to them in their experiences of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Spirit discloses what the Son is to the believers and makes Him real to them in their life, the Son is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By this the Son becomes the believers' life within and their expression without.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to glorify the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In particular, as the context of John 15 reveals, the Spirit of reality testifies concerning the Son as the vine v. 1 . The Spirit testifies in the presence of the persecuting religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, the Spirit testifies to the branches and through the branches to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Religion may persecute, but the Spirit of reality testifies that the Son is the true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Vindicating Him as God Manifested in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Timothy 3:16 reveals that the Spirit also works to vindicate Christ as God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Greek word translated "vindicated" in this verse may also be rendered "justified."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The incarnated Christ in His human living was vindicated as the Son of God by the Spirit Matt 3:16-17; Rom 1:3-4 and was also justified, proved, and approved as right and righteous by the Spirit Matt 3:15-16; 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was manifested in the flesh but vindicated and justified in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He appeared in the flesh, but He lived in the Spirit Luke 4:1, 14; Matt 12:28 and offered Himself to God through the Spirit Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His transfiguration Matt 17:2 and His resurrection were both vindications of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, in resurrection He even became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 to dwell and live in us Rom 8:9-10 for the manifestation of God in the flesh as the mystery of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, now we know Christ and His members no longer according to the flesh but according to the Spirit 2 Cor 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because the manifestation of God in the flesh is vindicated in the Spirit, and the Spirit is one with our spirit Rom 8:16 , we must live and behave in our spirit that this vindication may be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to 1 Timothy 3:16, the Spirit vindicates the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This took place in Christ while He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was God manifested in the flesh, and this was vindicated and verified by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The same principle applies to us, the church, today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is manifested in our flesh, but this needs to be verified, justified, and vindicated by the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a very real sense, the church today is the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This manifestation needs to be vindicated or justified by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the Spirit is working to vindicate, justify, testify, and confirm that the church is God's manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although the church is still in the flesh, the church is such a manifestation of God, a manifestation that is vindicated by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In actuality, only when we live in the all-inclusive Spirit is there the vindication and verification that God is manifested in us, the church.</S>
