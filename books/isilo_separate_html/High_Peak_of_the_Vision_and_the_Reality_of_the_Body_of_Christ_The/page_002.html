Lord, when we look back at the past up to the present time, we truly worship You, for everything depends on Your mercy and everything is done by Your mercy. As to ourselves, to this day we are still useless, still lacking, and still full of shortcomings before You. O Lord, what You have shown us is so much and so high, yet we have to admit before You that what we have practically entered into is very short. O Lord, we come, on the one hand, to worship You and thank You, and on the other hand, to confess to You our shortcomings and failures. Lord, grant us again Your visitation in these few days. We still look to You for Your mercy in fear and trembling. On our side, we are hopeless. O Lord, do cleanse us and anoint us. May You also bless us and guide us in our fellowship that we would not utter wasted words nor waste our time. We pray that You will support us.<p>O Lord, whenever we come into Your presence, as You taught us in Your prayer, we cannot forget that Your enemy is still here. We pray, Lord, that You would deliver us from his temptations. O Lord, may You truly enable us to overcome this evil one by the power of Your resurrection. O Lord, even more, we ask You to cover us with Your prevailing, precious blood and resist for us his attacks and disturbances. We further ask You to bind him for the sake of Your move on earth. O Lord, we pray that You would also remember our weakness. We are weak vessels; apart from You we can do nothing, we have nothing, and we are nothing. We can only worship You that You are everything. Amen.<p>Because you have all traveled by plane from so far away, I am very grateful within and also somewhat excited. Regretfully, I have not been to a meeting for three months. This is the first time in three months that I have gathered with you, brothers, for fellowship. I still feel that because of the need that is ahead of us, I cannot give you very much time. In these four nights, every night, besides the time for prayer, we will limit our time to one hour.<p>In the past three months I have had many, many things in me that I want to say to the churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, and I do not believe I could finish speaking in three or four hundred messages. I sense that in these few nights the Lord wants me to hand over something to you. Tonight we will fellowship concerning the high peak of the vision that the Lord has shown us in these more than seventy years. Tomorrow night perhaps we will fellowship concerning the reality of the Body of Christ. At the end we may speak a word of warning and of being on the alert.<h2 class=head1>THE VISION AND REVELATION THAT THE LORD SHOWED US THROUGH BROTHER NEE</h2><p>Thank the Lord that, according to what we know, as far as the history of the church and the existing state of the church are concerned, there has not been one age in which the Lord&#8217;s revelation to His church has been as thorough and as high as what He has revealed to us in the past seventy-four years, beginning with Brother Nee. Through Brother Nee He first showed us the matter of salvation. In those days thousands of Western missionaries went to China. Many of them had quite a measure of spiritual worth and were quite learned. But not one Western missionary taught concerning the matter of salvation in a thorough, well-rounded way. This was the case until Brother Nee was raised up by the Lord. He not only preached the gospel, but he saw the salvation accomplished by the Lord according to His redemption, from the inside to the outside, from the beginning to the end, in a complete, well-rounded way, and he also handed over everything to us. You all know about this. If you want to know the details, you need to read Brother Nee&#8217;s publications. For this reason we have compiled all his publications and printed them in three sets. Although you are all very busy, I still hope that you can read every page of those three sets.<p>Furthermore, through Brother Nee the Lord showed us the matter of the church. Concerning the church, the Lord showed us, on the negative side, that Christianity and Catholicism are altogether degraded and deformed. Never before had anyone spoken about the degradation of the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches in such a clear and thorough way as Brother Nee did. On the positive side, the Lord also led Brother Nee to see the local church, that is, the practical aspect of the church. He expended much effort in stressing this point. Eventually, the point of his emphasis became very clear. He enabled us to see clearly the ground of the church and the reality of the church.<p>Third, it was also through Brother Nee that God showed us the matter of Christ as our life. Christ is to be to us not only the Savior, the Redeemer, the Deliverer, the Grace-giver, and much more. These are not the center. The center is that Christ is to be our life. The Lord&#8217;s redeeming, saving, and giving of grace are not the goal but the procedure to reach the goal. God&#8217;s goal is Christ as our life. I say again, not only did the Western missionaries who went to China not stress this point; even in the entire history of Christianity only a handful paid attention to this point. This handful of people began mainly with Madame Guyon. Later, there were the mystics, and after them there were the inner-life people. Of course, Brother Nee stood on their shoulders, but Brother Nee saw something in a more thorough way and something higher, deeper, and richer than what they had seen.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
