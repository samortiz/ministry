   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is diligence?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the opposite of slothfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not shirking from responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A diligent person does not try to reduce his work to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the contrary, he tries to create work out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Lord's service, it is quite possible for us to take a day or two of rest if we do not look for work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not be those who stand around idly waiting for something to turn up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we work only when work turns up, we are not diligent persons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A diligent person is never idle; he is always looking for things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is always pondering, praying, contemplating, and considering before God as to what he should do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Unless he exercises himself this way, he can find himself with nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we only act "according to the book," we may soon find that there is not much of a book left.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should expect to find much work in our service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should discover many needs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to pray much to the Lord and look to Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should open our eyes, and as soon as we find something that needs to be done, we should do it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we finish a job, we should wait on the Lord and look to Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And as soon as we find more to do, we should tackle it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Following this, we should seek God's will again, and take on yet another task.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what it means to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working" John 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must never change this verse to read, "My Father is resting until now, and I also am resting."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Laziness is not our way; our way should be, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should ask the Lord, "What work do You have for me to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the Lord's conversation with the Samaritan woman, He asked His disciples a very strange question: "Do you not say that there are yet four months and then the harvest comes?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest" 4:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to His disciples, the harvest would not be ready for another four months.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But according to the Lord, the harvest had already come.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In man's view, one had to wait four months, but the Lord said, "Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The lack today is men who would lift up their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone wants to wait for four months to work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today many people are hiding at home instead of journeying in God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their eyes are not on what God is doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In John 5:17 the Lord said that He was always doing what His Father had sent Him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In John 4:35 He told us to lift up our eyes and look.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not lift up our eyes, we will not see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The matter of work is altogether related to the matter of diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It involves our conscientiousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not a matter of taking care of what is in our hands, but a matter of lifting up our eyes to look for things to do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is moving and acting behind many things, and we have to lift up our eyes to look for them in order to find them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to lift up our eyes to see the harvest and to see if it has ripened.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once we look, we will find work to do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How strange it is that so many people seem so idle; they seem to have nothing to do!</S>
