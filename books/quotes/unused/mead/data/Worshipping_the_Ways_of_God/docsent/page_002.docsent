   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT ARE THE WAYS OF GOD?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What are the ways of God?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ways in which God deals with us are His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His ways entail what He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ways of God are the choices He makes concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These are the ways of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His ways are higher than our ways Isa 55:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He has His own ordinations, and there is no room for our choice.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He deals with this person in this manner and with another person in that manner.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His ways are what He deems best.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ways of God imply that God acts according to His desire and choice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many people balk at the fact that, without an unveiling of God to man, we cannot accept God's ways.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must first have revelation before we can accept God's ways.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We ask, "Why did God love Jacob and not Esau?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We feel that God was not fair to Esau, and we even feel indignant about the way Esau was treated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We think that Esau was a very good man who was cheated out of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jacob was the one who was bad.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet God said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated" Rom 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet still we reason about this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who reason in this way have not seen God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who have seen Him know that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God can act according to His pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He does what makes Him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one can tell Him how He should act.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He does not need counselors or advisors.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He does not need an advisory board to tell Him how to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He does what He pleases.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are the ways of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ways of God are His choices.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The ways of God are what He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He wants to do things this way, and He wants to deal with us in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He wants to accomplish this matter but not something else.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He wants us to encounter this circumstance but not that one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These are the ways of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>NOT STOPPING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>WITH THE WORSHIP OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we have already pointed out, when a person receives a revelation concerning God and he sees that He is God and that man is man, he only can bow down and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we must not stop there because this is too abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must immediately say, "God, I worship You, and I worship Your ways.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not just worship You, I also worship Your ways."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our heart must be brought by God to the point of bowing down before Him and saying, "I see that I should not only worship You, but also what You have and what pleases You.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I should worship what You choose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I should worship what You have ordained for me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I should worship what You are pleased to bring upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I should worship You for the things You do not want me to pursue."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters, it is easy to worship God while we are gathered here in the meeting because there is no price to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But let me repeat that all true worship comes from knowing God and receiving a revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank God, I know Him; therefore, I fall before Him, saying, "Everything You have done is right.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You are never wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the way to accept the ways of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We learn to walk step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we want to learn to walk before God, we will have no future unless we can learn to worship the ways of God not just to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our entire spiritual future hinges on our ability to worship the ways of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, all who know God must be brought to the point of saying, "I worship the ways of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I worship the things that God has ordained for me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I worship the things God has done to me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I worship God for what He is pleased to do in me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I worship God for the things He strips from me."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>THE WORSHIPPERS OF GOD'S WAYS</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let us consider a few of the worshippers of God in the Old Testament to see how they worshipped God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We will see the ways of God from the examples of God's worshippers in the Old Testament.</S>
