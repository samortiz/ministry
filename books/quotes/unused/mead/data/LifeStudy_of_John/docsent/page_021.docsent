   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Anointing follows redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The anointing comes by way of the dove, the Spirit, which is the continuation of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lamb has removed sin and terminated the old creation, and the dove, the Spirit, has come to regenerate, impart life, transform, unite, and build.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The dove, the Spirit, regenerates the created man, transforms the natural man, and unites the transformed man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may be in any one of three situations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may be a created man who needs to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may be a regenerated man who is still quite natural and who needs to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may be a transformed man who is still separate and individualistic and who needs to be united with others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are properly transformed, we would be willing to be united with others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So, firstly, we need to be regenerated; secondly, we need to be transformed; and thirdly, we need to be united for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The dove, the Spirit, regenerates, transforms, and unites.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are all under the anointing of the dove, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although we may not realize it or may be ignorant of it, the Lord is working to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have the full assurance that all of the Lord s people eventually will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sooner or later, we shall all be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Transformation does not depend on us; it depends on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has chosen us and ordained us, and we cannot escape Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we try to escape, we will simply waste our time and give Him a little trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not even say that you can delay Him, for with Him a thousand years are as one day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is easy for Him to be patient with you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, every brother and sister will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we enter into the New Jerusalem, we shall see that everyone is jasper, precious stone Rev 21:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord is truly doing a transforming work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is not a great eagle, but a little dove the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This little dove is the continuation of the little Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the Lamb has died on the cross, the dove now in resurrection has His turn to work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Day by day, the little dove as the life-imparting Spirit speaks within you, rebuking you and touching your heart or conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Often, as you are in a department store, the dove bothers you from within.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not expect a big experience or a sudden change.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Expect the little dove to move and work within you all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have become involved in a process from which there is no escape.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This involvement is continuous and permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a sense, we have inward rest; in another sense, the little dove troubles us constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The inward working of this little dove is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all are under the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have observed that certain brothers and sisters have experienced a significant change due to the dove s transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you say that you do not like the church life and decide to leave it, you will find that you cannot escape the transforming work of the indwelling dove.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you want to be truly at rest, you should simply behave yourself as a good boy in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you do not behave yourself, but instead become a naughty boy, you will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But this suffering will help you to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Who can escape the way of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once we are caught, there is no escape.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may say, I don t like it, but He says, I like you so much.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You don t like Me, but I like you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more you dislike Me, the more I like you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What shall we say?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should do nothing and should just say, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once you have been captured by the Lord for the church life, you are hooked for transformation, and there is nothing that you can do to escape it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may not like it, but what can you do?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Where will you go?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no place to go.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God has destined us to be transformed for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Building</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After creation, incarnation, redemption, and anointing, we have building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This building is for the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God is building a dwelling place for Himself, and He is using transformed people as the stones 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Praise the Lord that we are not only undergoing the work of transformation, but are also in the process of building.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What God needs is not a great number of stones, but a house.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For eternity God needs a builded house, a Bethel, as His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In order for the Lord to come back, He needs the nation of Israel to be prepared and the church to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Look at Israel: she is nearly ready.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But Israel needs the church to match her.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although Israel is nearly ready, the church is not yet prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord does not care for the number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even if only a small number are completely processed, saturated, transformed, and built by and with Him, it will be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I do not speak this lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The coming of the Lord will not be according to our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The religionists did not understand His first coming and neither will they understand His second.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do not follow the religious way of understanding the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You must take the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you are in the way of life, then you know the way in which He will come.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It will be a sneaky way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Bible tells us that the Lord will return as a thief Rev 3:3; 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He will not come as a visitor who knocks at your door.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He will come in a stealthy way as a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You may miss Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you keep yourself in the way of life, you will see that the Lord will come in such a hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He will come in a mysterious way, in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Praise Him that we are in the secret way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord s coming back needs a solid building of His seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This building will be a stepping stone, a beachhead, for Him to take the earth, and it will be a mutual abode for both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It will be the mingling of divinity with humanity and of humanity with divinity forever.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Christ once was only divine.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In order for Him to be the Son of Man, He must have the human life and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We are human, but we can be born of God to become the children of God 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In order for us to be the children of God, we must have the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Eventually, He, the divine One, will have the human life and the human nature, and we, the human ones, will have the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Thus, He and we, we and He, will be exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is the mingling of divinity with humanity, and this is the mutual abode of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This building will be the ultimate fulfillment not only of Jacob s dream, but of God s eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It will terminate the bridge of time and usher in the blessed eternity in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We must be for that building and we must be that building!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>After all of these five items have transpired, we shall enter into eternity future with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>At that time, He will be both the Son of God and the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>As the Son of God, He will be life to us, and as the Son of Man, He will be the dwelling place for God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We shall be joined to and even mingled with Him, and we shall enjoy eternity with Him forever.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Nathanael, and all of us with him, will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is the revelation found in John chapter one.</S>
