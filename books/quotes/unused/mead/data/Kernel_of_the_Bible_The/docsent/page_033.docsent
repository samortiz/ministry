   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR ONLY GOD AND HUSBAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is not only the people of God, but also the wife of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is both our God and our husband.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With respect to Christ as our God, we must worship Him and Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anything we have besides Him is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But with respect to the Lord as our husband, the church must not be involved with any other man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a woman is involved with many men, she commits fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible idolatry and fornication are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Numbers 25, when the Moabites induced the children of Israel to commit fornication, the Israelites fell into idolatry also.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Solomon committed fornication by taking hundreds of wives and concubines, his wives turned away his heart after other gods 1 Kings 11:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, the church in Thyatira, a prefigure of the Roman Catholic Church, was involved with both fornication and idolatry Rev 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every idol is an illegal husband.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord is our unique God and our only husband.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Apart from Him, we must not have any other.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we should be a chaste virgin espoused to our one husband 2 Cor 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To love something in place of the Lord is to practice idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>DENOMINATIONAL NAMES, MARKS OF FORNICATION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the eyes of God denominational names, such as Lutheran and Episcopalian, are deplorable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My wife is rightly called Mrs. Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, suppose she bears a name tag that says, Mrs. Smith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although she tells people that she is Mrs. Lee, she continues to wear this name tag wherever she goes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This surely would cause confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And to me, her husband, it would be a great insult.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would say to her, What are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are you not my wife?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since you are my wife, why do you wear the name tag saying that you are Mrs. Smith? Suppose she answered, Certainly I am your wife, and my name is Mrs. Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Don t pay any attention to this name tag.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It doesn t mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I wear it simply for the sake of convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we may consider denominational names a convenience, they are actually marks of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why do you bear the name of Luther?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you belong to him?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Is Luther your husband?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why do you bear the name Episcopalian or Methodist?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are these the names of your husband?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A name means a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not try to excuse yourself by saying that denominational names are some kind of convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the eyes of the Lord every denomination commits fornication because it takes a name other than the name of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Revelation 3:8 the Lord Jesus commended the church in Philadelphia for not denying His name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But all denominations deny the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At least they take another name along with His name.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE DESPERATE NEED FOR ENLIGHTENMENT</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Look at today s situation in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is division, confusion, fornication, and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The daughters of the great prostitute are those involved with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who are still in division and confusion and who commit fornication are part of the daughters of the prostitute.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our age is very dark.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Under the light we see things clearly, but in the darkness nothing at all can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Most Christians today are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because they are in darkness, they can be involved with division, confusion, and fornication without having any consciousness of it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Their senses have been drugged.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They commit fornication without any awareness of what they are actually doing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How desperately they need to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today the Lord is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through His speaking, He shines upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In these days we all are under His enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After reading this message, you will not be able to say that you are not clear about division, confusion, fornication, and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>RECEIVING THE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the previous message I pointed out that to ask a person what church he belongs to is to ask a divisive question.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As long as you are in a division, you are in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But we in the Lord s recovery hate division and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whenever I meet a brother, I am satisfied to discover that he is a genuine believer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once I know that he is truly a brother in the Lord, I would never question him further to find out whether he is a Baptist, a Presbyterian, or a Methodist.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To ask such a question is to be divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are not divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We love all Christian brothers no matter whether they are Presbyterian, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, or Episcopalian.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am not a Methodist.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If I were a Methodist, I would ask a brother whether or not he is a Methodist.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If he were a Methodist, then I would love him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But we are neither Methodists, nor members of any other denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, we are simply Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead of being divisive, we love all our brothers, including those in the Catholic Church who are truly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We are all-inclusive, and we love all our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If I were to ask a brother whether or not he speaks in tongues, it would indicate that I either oppose tongue-speaking or favor it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If I oppose speaking in tongues, I would desire to find out if others speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If they do, I would condemn them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But if I favor speaking in tongues, I would also want to find out if others speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If they do, I would love them because I am in favor of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This also is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We do not care whether or not a brother speaks in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We care for him simply because he is a Christian brother.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We are not divisive, but all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whenever you ask questions to find out where a brother is, you are being divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the local churches we do not search out people to find out where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Rather, we embrace all Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We embrace those who speak in tongues and those who do not, those who wear long hair and those who have short hair.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We embrace Presbyterians, Lutherans, and even Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We receive every genuine believer.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>How wrong it is for any to condemn us for being narrow-minded!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>On the contrary, we are broad-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>After reading these messages concerning Babylon, you may be tempted to condemn others for being in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I encourage you never to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Do not go to your relatives and friends in the denominations and tell them that they are in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Be careful not to do this.</S>
