   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. An Additional Word on Psalm 8:2-5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 8 has nine verses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 1 and verses 6-9 are somewhat easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 2-5, however, are very puzzling and not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why did the psalmist, after talking about the earth with the excellency of Jehovah's name and the heavens with the glory, turn to the babes and sucklings?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to see that verses 2-5 show us how the babes and sucklings are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Psalms 3 7 David thought the earth was messy and full of problems, but in the Lord's view, His name is excellent on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, the Lord has set His splendor, His glory, above the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The earth is excellent, and the heavens are glorious, but the Lord has three categories of opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first is the adversaries, the second is the enemy, and the third is the avenger.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the earth, there is no problem; in the heavens, there is no problem; but what about in the air?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the air there are the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How does God deal with them?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Psalm 8 is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It talks about the earth, the heavens, man, and the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in addition to the earth, the heavens, man, and the coming kingdom, there are the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 2 says that because of the Lord's adversaries, He has established strength, or perfected praise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord has established strength or perfected praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings for the purpose of stopping His adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way God kills "three birds with one stone."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger, God makes the babes and sucklings to praise Him in a complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we need to consider who the babes and sucklings are.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sucklings are even younger than the babes, the infants, because they are still feeding on their mother's milk.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are the youngest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The little babes and sucklings do not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But after growing up, they do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To stop a person from doing things is nearly impossible, because all human beings are doers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The whole earth is filled with man's doings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Who can stop this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only the Lord can.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No unregenerated man is a babe or a suckling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We become babes and sucklings by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before I was regenerated, I was very active.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day when I was nineteen years old, I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That made me a quiet person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regeneration reduced my natural activity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I began to hate my doings, my speaking, and my thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I was remade, re-created, by the Lord's regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every believer who has been genuinely regenerated has experienced the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When a person becomes regenerated, he becomes quiet, not wanting to act or speak in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I was regenerated, I just wanted to read the Bible, to kneel down to pray, to muse on God, and to consider the things of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I became a real babe and a real suckling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord made me such through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We natural beings are always busy, doing a lot of work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The proper, genuine salvation stops our human doing and makes us the babes and sucklings to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We also have to realize that for the Lord to regenerate us, He had to undergo a number of procedures, or processes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He had to become a man, to live on this earth, to die, to enter into Hades for three days and three nights, and He had to rise up to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the Spirit, He comes into us to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, regeneration comes out of all the procedures of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why right after speaking about the babes and sucklings, the psalmist continues by saying, "When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers,/The moon and the stars, which You have ordained,/What is man....?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>3-4a .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this verse Your heavens, the works, and the moon and the stars are all in apposition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Strictly speaking, the writing here in verses 3-4a is not grammatically complete.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From the word When to the word ordained is a long subordinate clause, but where is the main clause?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this sentence, there is no main clause.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There should be a main clause following the subordinate clause.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead, after the subordinate clause, David asks, "What is man?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This writing is incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>David said in a poetic way, "When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers,/The moon and the stars, which You have ordained,/What is man?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not a complete sentence.</S>
