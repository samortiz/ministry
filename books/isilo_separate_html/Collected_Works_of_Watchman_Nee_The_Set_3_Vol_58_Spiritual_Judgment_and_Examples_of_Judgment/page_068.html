C.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. My father wanted me to study theology so that I could be a preacher. I joined a seminary in Shao-Kwan. After I graduated in 1927, I began to work as a preacher around the Hakkas people of south China. I was able to support myself and my co-workers from 1928 to 1938. Later, when I had used up my money, I prayed to the Lord for supply, and He answered my prayer. My grandmother wanted me to get married, and after I was married, she demanded that my wife do all the manual work, such as carrying water, cutting grass, and cooking for her. I was quite bothered. Later I moved to a place and started a mission hall. It was not like the local church, and I felt quite dry. For eight years I did not bear much fruit. I have been idle for the past twenty years. The thought of this puts me to shame before the Lord. I am unable to anything, as I was unable to do anything in the past. I have the Lord's word. I have heard it and seen it, but I am still unable to do anything. I need the Lord's mercy.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>The things that happened to you during the past twenty or more years are over. I hope that from now on you will receive the supply from the brothers and sisters and the church so that your pathway will become straight. You have to pay attention to two things. First, your mind is very quick. I do not know if you feel this way or not. What you have learned from the Lord is not as much as you think you have learned. Your inward experience does not match your outward mind. You are a very smart person. If the Lord made you strong and powerful inwardly, your inward condition would match your outward condition. The outer man of some people cannot match their inner man. With you, it is the opposite; your inner man cannot match your outer man. You should pay attention to this first.</p><p>Second, you have to restrict yourself and be a little more weighty in your ordinary conversation with the brothers and sisters. Some terms and expressions should be avoided. I am afraid that in your ministry of the word, your own clever and flippant words sometimes slip out of your mouth. A clever word is never as effective as a weighty word. I am not saying that you have said anything wrong. I am saying that you have to pay attention to how you say things at ordinary times. You have to learn a lesson here: Your words are not weighty enough. Your speaking is too clever and flippant. You have to learn to speak weighty words. Your mind is quick, and this is not a good sign. In spiritual things the mind should never be ahead of the spirit.</p><p>Every time the Lord works in us, that is, every time He deals with us, we should reap rich results from such experiences. If our emotion and mind do not have any "leakage," we will surely reap rich results. Suppose a brother has a problem, and he weeps and cries about it. If a jovial person comes along making jokes and laughing, these jokes will nullify the tears and the weeping of the brother. The sorrow and pain will become less cutting. The same principle applies in spiritual matters. A clever thought or a flippant word will cancel out the desired effect a dealing should produce in a man. Sometimes a spiritual subject should carry a heavy weight, but a flippant word nullifies it. One cannot joke about spiritual things. God's work in man can be weighty or flippant, depending on what we make of it. We have to reject everything that tends to reduce spiritual weight. When God deals with us in a weighty way, there should be a weighty result. If the result is not weighty, there must be a leak. If a water bucket receives a great quantity of water yet is never full, there must be a leak. God has dealt severely with you with regards to your marriage. Yet when you speak about it, it does not sound as if you have received any deep cut from the dealing. This is because the result has leaked away. Bearing the cross does not mean that we are nonchalant about things. It means that we accept these things for the Lord's sake. Our brother has to ask the Lord to restrict his thoughts, and he has to guard against diluting spiritual things. His inward being has to be strong, and his mind has to be under his control. If he can do this, his spirit will be strong, and he will become more useful in the ministry of God's word.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_067.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_069.html">Next</a> </body></html>
