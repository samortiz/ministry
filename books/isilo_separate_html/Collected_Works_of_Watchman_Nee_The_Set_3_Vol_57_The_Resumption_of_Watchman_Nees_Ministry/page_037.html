If we make it a method, it will become very dead indeed. The question is not Catholicism or local churches. The question is whether the church is in doctrine or in life. I fear method as much as I fear Catholicism. The local church cannot become a method. Once it becomes a method, it will become very, very heavy. This is our basic problem today.</p><p>We cannot say that the Catholic Church is all wrong. If the Catholic Church would remove her idols, the oneness that she talks about would be right.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING "HANDING OVER''</h2><p>I still need to say something concerning the question of "handing over.''</p><h2 class="head2">Handing Over Being a Make-up Lesson<br />and Not a Teaching</h2><p>The matter of "handing over'' must never become our teaching. It is not a teaching, but a "make-up'' lesson. There is the need for this make-up lesson because the matter was not taken care of properly at the beginning. It is like a man riding on a train: he should first buy the ticket and then board the train. However, some people have boarded the train without paying for the ticket. As a result, there is the need for some kind of make-up measure. Tickets should be bought at the train station. After a man is saved, he should immediately consecrate himself (Rom. 6:6, 12-13), and he should not wait until a later date to make it up. But many Christians have not done this properly, and the church has not properly presented this need from the beginning. We can say that the church has given the believers a "bonus ride''; they boarded the train without paying for the ticket. But sooner or later, they still must pay for the ticket.</p><p>For the new ones who have just come in, we do not need to ask them to hand themselves over. What they need is to consecrate themselves. There is a "handing over'' because their consecration was not done properly at the beginning. As a result, there is the need for such a make-up lesson. The standard of salvation is not high enough today, and many of the items a person should have acquired at the time of salvation have been lost. Strictly speaking, when a man is saved, he should be fully consecrated and should fully live for the spread of the gospel. As soon as a person comes in, we should lay the full demand on his shoulder. If we can do this, no one among us will still hold hands with the world after they are saved, nor will they have to come back at a later date to consecrate themselves.</p><p>When men thronged to follow the Lord in the Gospels, He presented His requirements to them. He explained that a man must take up his own cross before he can follow Him (Matt. 10:38; 16:24). The Lord never lowers His standard. On the contrary, He lifts the standard high. He says that man should follow Him, and that if a man is to follow Him, he has to do this and that. Let me emphasize that a man cannot go on after he is saved unless he consecrates himself. Unless he takes up his cross, he cannot go on. If we want to come to the Lord, we have to consecrate ourselves, and we have to take up our cross and give up the world and our individualism. All these things must be clearly dealt with when a person is saved.</p><p>The matter of "handing oneself over'' is a measure taken because nothing else can be done. It is like a man riding a train without a ticket. Since he cannot get off the train, the only way is for him to buy a ticket then. For now, we have settled for the term "handing over.'' One day, when everyone is consecrated as soon as he is saved, there will be no further need for anyone to "hand themselves over.'' But the things that should have been done on the first day have been lost. Everyone has boarded the train without a ticket; some have climbed into the carriages through the windows, while others have walked in without a ticket. Although they have boarded the train without a ticket, they cannot go on with their free ride indefinitely. Sooner or later, they will have to pay for their ticket. There is a difference between buying a ticket on the train and buying it at the station. Buying a ticket on the train is abnormal, whereas buying it at the station is normal. If everyone bought his ticket on the train, there would be no need for a ticket booth at the station. If everyone buys his ticket on the train, the ticket booth might just as well be moved into the train.</p><p>I am afraid that after some time the matter of "handing over'' will become a new terminology among us. It is possible that in the future the matter of "handing over'' will become a peculiar thing among us. If this happens, those teachers who come after us will write and ask us about the scriptural foundation for the practice of "handing oneself over.'' There is no such doctrinal term as "handing over.'' We borrow this term today because men do not have a proper and good beginning. If everyone begins in a proper way, there is no need to bring up this question any longer.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
