   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE SECRET TO THE SUCCESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We shall consider two passages of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is Colossians 1:27-29, which says, What are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second passage is 2 Corinthians 4:1, 2 and 5, which says, Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart; but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God....For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>PRESENTING EVERY MAN FULL-GROWN IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In these passages of the Scriptures, Paul shows us not only the mystery of God hidden throughout the ages but also the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, he shows us how the apostles carried out the ministry and accomplished the mysterious work of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Colossians 1:27 he says, What are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some versions translate the latter phrase as Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These translations may come from different manuscripts, but they both make sense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, you refers to the New Testament readers; on the other hand, us refers to the apostles at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul then goes on to say, Whom we announce...in all wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul uses all his wisdom to announce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His announcing is not according to a single kind of method or speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, it is multilayered, multifaceted, and multidirectional.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He exhausts all of his wisdom not only to announce but also to admonish every man and teach every man, that he may present every man full-grown in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word full-grown includes being perfect, complete, and grown up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Greek this word basically means grown up unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a person grows up unto maturity, that is the time he is perfect and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is Paul s meaning in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He preached Christ to others, hoping that one day they would grow up unto maturity and become perfect and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perfect denotes full in quality, whereas complete denotes full in quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be full-grown is to be completely perfect, without any lack in quality or quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there is a blemish in a precious stone, it is not perfect, and if it is lacking a corner, it is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A precious stone must be pure within and have no blemish; this is to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, for the stone to be perfect does not necessarily mean that it is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only if the stone is properly faceted without the slightest flaw can it be considered complete.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being perfect and complete in Christ is the result of growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, Paul says that we need to present men to Christ in this manner, that is, to present them full-grown in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the ultimate goal of Paul s ministering to people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 29 Paul goes on to say, For which also I labor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here Paul uses the word labor, not merely work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To labor means to toil at a difficult task.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Any kind of job that requires laboring is not an easy one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>An easy job does not require us to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul labored according to His operation which operates in me in power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What kind of power is this?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the power that is activated within us and continues to operate in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, Paul adds that he was struggling according to this power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Greek word for struggling is used to describe the struggling, contending, wrestling, and fighting of athletes in the Olympic games.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus said in John 18:36, My kingdom is not of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To struggle indicates a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, this is a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>NOT HOPING FOR EASE AND COMFORT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>IN SERVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we all know, people like pleasure but not suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, today we cannot serve Christ on a sedan chair.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no such thing, and there is no such chair.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul in the New Testament was one who struggled, like the contenders in athletic contests 1 Cor 9:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He boxed, not as though beating the air, and he ran the race ahead of others in order to win.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If his struggling were like weight lifting, then he must lift clean and high.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was the nature of his struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Jude 3 exhorts the believers to earnestly contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This shows us that we need not only to struggle but also to contend for the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All these meanings are included in struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Matthew 25 the Lord Jesus spoke a parable concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The kingdom is like a man who was about to go abroad, called his own slaves, and delivered to them his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Later the master returned, and the one who had received one talent, the cautious one, came before him and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And I was afraid vv.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>24-25a .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is as if he were saying, O master, behold, your one talent is still intact; I kept it for you and did not lose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The master seemed to reply, You are absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow, then why did you not use the one talent to earn interest?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Why did you hide it?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For that slave, earning interest was a psychologically taxing job.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It seemed best for him not to do anything and not to move anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This person had completely lost his morale.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The master said to him, You should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest v. 27 . If we are those willing to struggle for the Lord, the Lord will be able to gain much and even recover what is His with interest.</S>
