   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN LEADING NEW BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO KNOW THE CHURCH 3 WHAT THE CHURCH IS TO GOD AND TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In relation to God, the church is first the house of God 1 Tim 3:15 and then the kingdom of God Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In relation to Christ, the church is first the Body of Christ Eph 1:22b-23 and then the bride of Christ 5:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church as the Body of Christ is for His expression, and the church as the bride of Christ is for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two items concerning what the church is to Christ are typified in Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, Eve was built from Adam s rib and became one flesh with him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, she was Adam s wife.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Ephesians 2, 4, and 6, we see that the church is also the new man and the warrior, both of which are for the accomplishment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church as the new man is for living out God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church as the warrior is for defeating God s enemy and bringing in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THREE ASPECTS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>LIFE, LIVING, AND EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A house is a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A house can also refer to a household or a family and speaks of a life relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Greek word translated house denotes not only a dwelling place but also a family.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, when we use the word house, we are referring to both meanings: a household and a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The house of God is related to life, to living, and to expression and function.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first matter in any family is life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>An American family has the American life, and a Chinese family has the Chinese life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Life is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once there is life, there will be a living, and a living produces an expression, which is also a function.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every person in this house is born of God and is a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only when we have the life of God can we be the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The house of God is related to living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God lives in us, and we live out the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The living of the church should be the living out of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The house of God is related to expression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once we live out the living God, we will have an expression, a function.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such an expression is the truth, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The central truth in the Bible is God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the church as the pillar and base of the truth v. 15 . The church is born of God, and the church lives out God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the church is the pillar and base of the truth, the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The truth is not centered on baptism or love but on the great mystery of godliness God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, the central truth in the Bible is God being joined with man in order to dispense Himself into His people so that they, as His children, may become His house to express Him as the great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that God entering into man and being lived out from within man is the great mystery of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church as the pillar and base of the truth holds the truth concerning God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church does not teach concerning morality and ethics or religious rituals or ceremonies, such as baptism and bread-breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the house of God, the church lives out and upholds the truth concerning God being manifested in the flesh, God being mingled with and dispensing Himself into men so that they may become His dwelling place and His household in order to live Him out and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When speaking concerning the church being God s house, we must point out these three items: life, living, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE CHURCH LIFE BEING THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church is God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Matthew 16 the Lord first spoke of the church and then of the kingdom, showing that the church is God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church and God s kingdom are not two separate things; they are two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is on the aspect of life, and the kingdom of God is on the aspect of living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Chapter 16 shows that the church is a matter of life, and then it shows that the kingdom is a matter of living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we speak of living, the church is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Romans 14:17 proves that the church is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Chapter 14 is on the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 17 says, The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This verse is related to our living and shows that the kingdom of God is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The relationship between the kingdom of God and the church is a matter of life and a matter of living.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the church is not merely in the realm of life but also of living, it is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The kingdom of God is the church life, which is not eating and drinking but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must lead new believers to see that the church life is the kingdom.</S>
