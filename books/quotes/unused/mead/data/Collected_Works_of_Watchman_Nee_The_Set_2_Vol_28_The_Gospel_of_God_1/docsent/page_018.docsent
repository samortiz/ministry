   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECOND GREAT MISTAKE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT KNOWING GOD'S INTENTION IN GIVING THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man thinks that he can be saved by the works of the law because he has never read the Bible or seen the light or the heavenly revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has never understood God's desire and intention.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has never understood the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you want to know whether or not you can be saved by the works of the law, you need to first ask why God gave the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only after you find out God's purpose in giving the law will you know whether or not you can be saved by the works of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before me is a podium.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I ask you what this is, some may answer that it is a high chair.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A small girl may answer that it is a bed short of two legs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Another may say that this is a dresser because there are drawers in it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I were to ask a brother, he may say that this is a bookshelf, because one can put books on it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If I were to ask ten people, I might get ten different answers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A bookseller, for instance, may tell me that it is a perfect sales counter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every person would have an answer according to his own experience and concept.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if you want to know what it really is, you need to ask the one who made it in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If he tells you that this is a dresser, then it is a dresser.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If he tells you that this is a bookshelf, then it is a bookshelf.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If he tells you that this is a podium, then it is a podium.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same manner, if you ask me or anyone else what the function of the law is, you are asking the wrong person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The law was given by God, so we have to ask God about its function.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once God tells us His intention in giving the law, we will know whether man can be saved by the works of the law or not.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we must spend some time to look into the Bible concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must see how the law came in, step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to see historically from the record of the Bible why God gave man the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE LAW NOT BEING GOD'S ORIGINAL THOUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first thing we must see is that the law was not at all in God's original thought.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The law was added in afterwards; it was brought in to meet certain urgent needs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was produced to take care of certain things that came in along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law was not in God's original thought; grace was in God's original thought.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second Timothy 1:9-10 says, "Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages but now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here the apostle Paul tells us that God had a thought, and this thought began before the times of the ages, before the creation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was God's original thought.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And what kind of thought was it?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul says that this grace was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before man ever sinned, and even before the creation of the world, God had already made the decision to give us His grace through Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, grace was God's original thought.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was something that God planned from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why did God want to give us grace?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul says that God "has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's will is to dispense His grace, and this grace saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He saved us and called us with a holy calling so that we may enjoy His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is what God's grace is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He desired to save us and to call us with a holy calling according to His purpose, according to what He plans to do.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here Paul was very careful; he added a phrase to show us whether the law is according to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He says, "Not according to our works."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's salvation is not according to how much we can do for God; it is not according to how much responsibility we can bear before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, it is God coming to accomplish something for us, and it is God giving us His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This grace was always related to His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So let us remember that before the times of the ages, God's thought was grace, not works or the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul continues, "Which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages but now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This grace has not been manifested until now.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, you see that though this grace was planned long ago, it was not until the Lord Jesus came that we knew what grace really was.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What does this grace do for us?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let us read on: "Who nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the Lord Jesus was manifested, He abolished works as well as the result of works.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The result of evil works is death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if you have done the worst works, the most that the law can do is require your death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After you die, the law cannot do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You may ask, "What happens if my works have not violated the law?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do I still need to die?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the Lord has also nullified death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord has done away with works, and He has done away with death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is our gospel, which was planned before the times of the ages, even though it was not manifested until the appearing of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, the basic thought with God was grace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After man was created, both Adam and Eve sinned and rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sin entered into the world through one man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But God did not give man the law at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For a period of about 1600 years after man sinned, God did not give man the law.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God had no demands on man during that period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God allowed history to take its natural course.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then one day, four hundred and thirty years before Moses instituted the law, God spoke to Abraham, the father of faith, and chose him to be the one through whom Christ would come into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God chose Abraham and gave him the great promise that all the nations would be blessed through his seed Gen 12:3; 22:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Notice that the seed is singular, not plural; it is one seed, not many seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul explained in the book of Galatians that this seed refers to the Lord Jesus Gal 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When God spoke to Abraham, it was the first time God revealed His purpose that had been planned before the times of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God told him that His purpose, from before the times of the ages, was that through his seed, Jesus Christ, the nations would be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Abraham was an idol worshipper, yet God chose him and gave him a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He was the first one to be without works; he was a person of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Hence, God unfolded His purpose before him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You have to pay attention to one particular point here.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God's word to Abraham is unconditional.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God simply said, "I will save and bless the world through your seed."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He gave no conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God did not say that Abraham's descendants had to be this or that, or that the kingdom to come forth from him in the future had to be this or that before he would have a seed and the world would be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>No. God simply said that he would have a seed who would save the world.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It did not matter if Abraham was good or bad; it did not matter if his descendants were good or bad; and it did not matter if his kingdom was good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There was no condition attached.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is the way He wanted it done.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He would cause the seed to bring blessing to the people in the world.</S>
