	 <h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD AND<br />
EXPERIENCING ANOTHER COMFORTER</h2>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments. And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever&rdquo; (14:15-16). <em>Commandments</em> refers to His words. As we keep the Lord&rsquo;s words, another Comforter comes. Although the Holy Spirit is already in us, when we receive a word from the Lord and keep that word, we have a deep sense of the Holy Spirit coming to us as another Comforter, because of the freshness of His taste. For example, as we are walking toward a department store, the Lord may tell us not to go into the store. At this point we have to either follow or disobey the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. Occasionally, we turn away out of our love for the Lord, but often we bargain with the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I am already here. Please let me go in just this one time.&rdquo; The Lord rarely responds by saying, &ldquo;Absolutely not!&rdquo; Rather, He indicates His feeling and leaves the decision to us. Most of the time, we follow our own feeling and do not turn away. Consequently, when we go into the store and make several purchases, we often have a sense of deadness within as if the Holy Spirit has disappeared. Yes, we still have the Holy Spirit in us, but our touch with the Lord is gone, and we even feel shameful before the Lord. At such a time, we do not have a fresh sense that there is another Comforter in us.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; when the Lord says, &ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; and say Amen, we will sense the Holy Spirit within us as another Comforter. As we head toward our home, it will seem almost as if we were flying, because we sense the comforting presence of the Spirit. When we love Him and keep His commandments, another Comforter comes to us.</p>
<p>Verse 15 of chapter 14 says, &ldquo;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.&rdquo; Then verse 16 says, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter.&rdquo; Ordinarily we separate these two verses, but actually they are connected. If we desire to have another Comforter, we must love the Lord and keep His commandments. Then in our experience the Lord will become another Comforter, bringing us the fresh taste of the Holy Spirit as our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MANIFESTING HIMSELF<br />
AND MAKING AN ABODE WITH US<br />
BY OUR KEEPING OF THE LORD&rsquo;S WORDS</h2>
<p>Verses 20 and 21 of chapter 14 say, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him.&rdquo; If we arrive at a department store and the Lord says, &ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; do you think that the Lord will manifest Himself to us if we do not listen to His word? Although He is still in us, He will hide Himself. The Lord will never forsake us or leave us, but He will not always manifest Himself to us. I do not encourage you to watch movies. However, if you go to a movie, the Lord will go with you. Nevertheless, He will go in a hidden way, and you will not be able to feel His presence or His manifestation.</p>
<p>After the children of Israel worshipped the molten calf, God told Moses to bring the Israelites to Canaan but that He would not go up in their midst with them (Exo. 33:3). However, Moses negotiated with God, saying, &ldquo;If Your presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here&rdquo; (v. 15). It was as if he said, &ldquo;God, this will not do. I am not going. Your presence must go with us; otherwise, I will not go. I know You can exercise Your power to lead us into Canaan. However, if we cannot touch Your presence, we will not be able to endure the journey. Therefore, Your presence has to go with us.&rdquo; What does it mean for God&rsquo;s presence to be with us? Suppose three people are riding together in a train, but one of the three is unhappy and does not want to sit in the same train seat with the other two. Even though he is going with the other two, they do not have his immediate presence. Similarly, even though the Lord is in us, we will not have His immediate presence if we do not keep His words. As soon as we respond to the Lord&rsquo;s words, however, His presence with us is immediately manifested. It is a special blessing to know the Lord as another Comforter and have His manifestation by keeping His words.</p>
<p>In John 14:23 Jesus also said to His disciples, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; Since the Lord Jesus is in us already, why does He say that He will come to us and make an abode with us? Does this imply that He is not in us? No, He is in us, but in order for us to enjoy not only His manifestation but also His abiding in us, we must be those who love Him and keep His word. In such a condition we will have a special sense of the Lord&rsquo;s abiding in us. Further, we will be practically one with the Lord, because He will be our person within, and we will be His manifestation without.</p>
<p>It is easy to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, but the greatest test is how we deal with the Lord&rsquo;s word when it comes to us. Many times we let the Lord abide in us, but we do not let His word abide in us. For example, a sister may let her husband reside in their home but still not receive his words. Sometimes wives argue with their husbands, and husbands argue with their wives. Similarly, we often argue with the Lord. Although we may not openly defy the Lord&rsquo;s words, we often ignore them. We are willing to let the Lord indwell us, but we are unwilling to let His words abide in us. This is our real situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
SO THAT WE MAY GROW IN LIFE</h2>
<p>In these days many saints are calling on the name of the Lord, and our meetings are becoming more living. However, the growth in life in the saints is still slow. The Lord said, &ldquo;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&rdquo; (v. 15). Do we really love Him? Do we really keep His commandments? His commandments are of two kinds&mdash;constant and instant. His constant commandments are found in the Bible, whereas His instant commandments often consist of only one word, <em>no.</em> If a Christian can always obey the word <em>no,</em> he will grow in life. For example, when we say, &ldquo;Lord, I want to visit my relatives,&rdquo; He may say, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; When we say, &ldquo;Lord, I want to buy something,&rdquo; He may say, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; The Lord says &ldquo;No!&rdquo; to us numerous times during a day, but we ignore His word because we want to do as we please. This hinders our growth in life.</p>
<p>Actually, outward exhortations are useless. It is useless for me to exhort you not to love the world or not to lose your temper. Instead, we should call on the Lord and receive His words because we love Him. The food that we eat must be digested in our stomach. Similarly, the words that we receive must be allowed to operate in our being. If we do not digest the Lord&rsquo;s words, we will suffer from &ldquo;indigestion&rdquo; and become spiritually sick. Even though we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name and pray-read the Bible, there will be spiritual growth only if we allow His words to operate in our being.</p>
<p>We must look to the Lord for His mercy so that He may give us a heart that loves Him fervently and absolutely. When His word enters into us, it must be received and digested. This will provide us with the proper spiritual nutrients, and we will grow in life. This is our need today. We all need to pray for this. We should not only call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, breathe Him in, and drink Him, but we must also eat His Word in a genuine way, digesting His Word and allowing His word to operate in us. Then He will gain ground in our being, manifest Himself to us, and make an abode with us so that we will grow in life.</p>
