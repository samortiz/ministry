   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WE BEING RESPONSIBLE TO PLANT AND WATER,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT GOD CAUSING THE GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The purpose of going over this history is so that we would realize that the turmoil in the church in Manila in 1961 did not begin in 1961.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, the seed was planted there in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I visited the Philippines yearly for eleven years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Aside from Manila I did not go anywhere else; I worked only in Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Within me I knew where the element of rejection lay, but I did not reveal it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My attitude was that as long as the church in Manila did not openly reject me, I would just do the work of sowing, planting, and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I did not care for what existed in Manila; I only sowed, planted, and watered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Each time I came, I would not touch anything negative but would sow, plant, and water in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was very clear within that one day this place would reject me, but until that day came, I had to take the opportunity to sow, plant, and water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was not until the real rejection became open and manifest that I stopped coming to Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, I was still waiting to see if what I had sown, planted, and watered would bring forth some fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1961 turmoil arose, and the church in Manila truly and completely rejected me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The opposing ones wrote on a long bench in the old meeting hall: Down with the four elders; cast out Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the news reached me, I thought, Will there be any result of my sowing, planting, and watering here for the past eleven years?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the following morning, an elder who customarily attended morning watch at the old meeting hall saw four guards guarding the meeting hall and a notice posted on the door declaring that no one without the express permission of the Board of Trustees could enter the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders telegraphed me that very day to tell me about the real situation and asked me what should be done since the meeting hall had been taken over.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I did not know how to reply.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After looking to the Lord for more than a day, I sent a reply telegram saying that they should negotiate with the two main opposing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Subsequently, however, the brothers found another hall in which to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today I am very happy and at ease because I can see that the work of sowing, planting, and watering during those eleven years has yielded fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time, some of the brothers were still small tree seedlings only sprouts with hardly any growth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today those brothers have become elders.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some who were not attractive then have become quite beautiful now.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a brother who is now an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was difficult at that time to discern whether he was a little plant or a piece of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now he has grown to be a very sturdy tree, full of the organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I listen to his prayers or pay attention to his sharing, I feel that he is inwardly bright with clear revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sky above him is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This work is not of man but of God; it is God who causes such ones to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of open fellowship is especially for the young saints to see that we should not do the work of an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should only do the organic work of a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The reason we are happy is because we can see the manifestation of the organic function in this organism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Due to God s mercy and grace, during those eleven years I did not do the work of an organization; rather, bit by bit I was there doing an organic work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today everyone can see the function of this organism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is God s garden in which there are many big trees as well as many smaller ones growing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They will all grow and bear fruit, manifesting the organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>More than one hundred churches in the southern islands of the Philippines have been raised up through the sixty lessons of the Fundamental Truths in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was not due to organization or man s arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was entirely the result of the development of the Lord s organic function within the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They also testified that the life-studies have rendered them tremendous help, not just giving them some outward supply or some understanding of objective doctrines, but causing them to grow in life and to have some subjective and real experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>More than ten years ago when I went to Mindanao, what I saw at that time had already brought me much joy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today when I see so many of the saints in Mindanao fervently seeking the Lord by reading spiritual literature, I am filled with even greater joy within.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through fellowship I have discovered that they have a clear vision.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is proof that the churches in Mindanao are not the work of an organization but entirely the issue of the life supply in the Body of Christ and the result of the manifestation of the organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This deeply touches me within.</S>
