   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Grace Which Is Given to the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>according to What Kind of Gifts Gifted Persons</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They Are in the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 4:7 says, To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The gift here refers to a gifted person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The measure of the gift of Christ is the size of a member of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul was a big gifted person, a big member, so the grace he received was big.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This may be likened to the members of our physical body receiving more or less of the blood supply based upon their size.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our shoulder and little finger receive the same blood, but the shoulder receives more blood than our little finger does.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 12:6 says that the gifts differ according to the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, the size of the gifted persons determines how much grace is given.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, the gift is according to the grace because the grace produces and supplies the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more you grow, the more grace you have and the more gift you have.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we grow in grace, our gifts are developed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why the gifts are according to the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They come out of the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Ephesians the grace is given according to the gift; the grace will be given to you according to what kind of member you are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>40.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Grace concerning the Entire Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>of Christ Which Is Ministered to Others out of</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>the Believers Mouth in Their Common Talk</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 4:29 says, Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This grace is concerning the entire salvation of Christ, which is ministered to others out of our mouth, even our common talk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must admit that in our daily life we do not minister much grace to others in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must learn not to speak wasted words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, every word should minister the grace of God as a part of the entire salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>41.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Grace That Is with Those</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who Love the Lord in Incorruptibility</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 6:24 says, Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a hard phrase for us to understand in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may say that we love the Lord, but our love may be merely in our emotion, in our likes and dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Much of what we like and dislike is corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no incorruptibility in our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Incorruptibility in Ephesians 6 refers to all the crucial items in the foregoing chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In chapter one are the choosing and predestinating of the Father, the redemption of the Son, the sealing of the Spirit, and the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In chapter two there is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In chapter three there is Christ s making His home in our hearts unto the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In chapter four there are the building up of the Body, the oneness of the Body, the framework of the Body, and the Triune God as the contents of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In chapter five there is the church as the wife of Christ, and in chapter six there is the church as God s warrior with the full armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these positive things mentioned in the six chapters of Ephesians are incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should love the Lord Jesus according to all the incorruptible items mentioned in the six chapters of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our love for the Lord should not be merely according to our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, we must love the Lord in the divine, heavenly, and spiritual realities.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>42.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Grace of Which the Philippian Believers</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Were Partakers with the Apostle Paul</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Both in His Bonds and in His Defense</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>and Confirmation of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Philippians 1:7 Paul said that the Philippians shared his grace in his bonds and in his defense and confirmation of the gospel.</S>
