   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TREASURE AND THE EARTHEN VESSEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul's word in 2 Corinthians 4:7 matches the teaching here.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have often thought that Paul painted a wonderful picture in that chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He compared himself to an earthen vessel, one made of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He compared the power of resurrection within him to a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is like the precious ointment in the alabaster box.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He knew very well that he himself was just an earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the treasure within him constituted the excellency of power.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is a vast difference between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul said that this resurrection power is a treasure and that it is a surpassingly great power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is truly the word of an honest man; he said it like it was "the excellency of the power."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Following this he said that he was pressed on every side, but that he was not constricted because of the efficacy of the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In himself he could not find a way out, but with the treasure he was not utterly without a way out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In himself he was persecuted, but with the treasure he was not abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In himself he was cast down, but with the treasure he was not destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As far as he was concerned, he was pressed on every side.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But as far as the treasure was concerned, he was not constricted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, there is death, but on the other hand, there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, we have a constant deliverance to death, but on the other hand, we have the producing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Death operates on the one hand, and life is manifested on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second Corinthians 4 and 5 unfold the center of Paul's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we find the principle of death and resurrection and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything in us is death, and everything in the Lord is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>AUTHORITY BEING WHERE RESURRECTION IS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there is any authority in us, this authority comes from God, not from us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should never be mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should see clearly that all authority comes from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are here on earth merely to maintain His authority; we are not here to maintain our own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Authority does not belong to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever we trust in the Lord, we see authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever we express the natural life, we become the same as everyone else, and there is no authority in us whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only that which issues from resurrection results in authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Authority is based on resurrection, not on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No ordinary rod can be placed before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only a rod of resurrection can be placed before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, resurrection is found in the budding rod.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not a general resurrection but a full resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not just a faint expression of the resurrection life but a life that has budded, blossomed, and brought forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is resurrection life in maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only one matured in resurrection life can act as God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more resurrection life is expressed through us, the more authority we will have.</S>
