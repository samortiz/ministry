   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 7 shows us that Paul was chosen by God to be a minister of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God perfected him to such an extent that his ministry became the very utterance of the divine inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His speaking was so accurate that not a single word missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His word not only contains God's word, but it is so accurate that every sentence and phrase hits the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How did he acquire this ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He acquired it by being thoroughly dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God worked on him to the point that his thoughts, words, decisions, and opinions were all approved by God; they were all right and accurate in His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With Paul, there was not the accuracy of a machine but the accuracy of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With Paul, we can see how God puts His word in man and how He releases it through man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He does not speak His word through man in the way of a verbatim repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the release of God's word were merely a matter of man repeating God's utterances word for word, such a task would be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But God does not release His word this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, He puts His word in man; man has to search it out with his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God puts His light in man, and man has to capture this light with his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God lays His burden in man, and man has to express this burden through his own word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is man who exercises his thought; it is man who searches and speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet when the word is released, God acknowledges it as His own word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The New Testament ministry of the word is not one in which God dictates His message word by word and then man repeats it word for word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When His word is revealed to man in the New Testament, its light first shines into man's spirit as a flicker.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This creates a burden within man's spirit for the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This light can fade away quickly, and man must catch its glow by exercising his own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He has to "fix" this light with his own thoughts or else the light will seemingly disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He has to fix the light with his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has to inquire of God for utterance that he may receive one or two sentences that crystallize his light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He may ponder, and a phrase may come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then he may write down the phrase, or he may have a certain feeling, judgment, or opinion concerning a certain matter, and he may speak it out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While he is relating his feelings, inward judgment, and opinion, the burden within his spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more he speaks, the more the light within his spirit that has been captured with his mind is released.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At a certain point, the burden is fully released.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has spoken his own words, expressed his own thoughts, feelings, and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But after he has finished his speaking, God acknowledges these words to be His own.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you see how vastly different this is from the creed-like declarations of man's imagination?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are doing the speaking, the writing, and the considering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But because you have been so thoroughly dealt with by God, your speaking is acknowledged by God as His own word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the meaning of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is hidden within you is only a light, a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But you have your opinions, proposals, and feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While you are brooding over your opinions, feelings, thoughts, and judgments, God gives you a few words or sentences to enunciate your inner registration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you utter these words and sentences, God acknowledges this as His word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, a man has to climb to a great height before he can be considered as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there are flaws in his mind, emotion, or feeling, he cannot be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Unless his very person has passed through God's dealings, his opinion will not be trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When his opinion is expressed, God will not recognize it as His own word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many times you can tell that a brother's word does not meet this standard as soon as he opens his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You can tell that what he has are only his own words; they are not God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God puts so much trust in His ministers that He would give them a light, a burden, or an impression and would leave it up to them to grasp and sense the utterance and to make suggestions and proposals concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although such suggestions and proposals are their own, God puts His trust in their activities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He believes in His own ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God wants to operate in man to such an extent that man is like Him in his opinions, thoughts, feelings, and views.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If our desire can be one with God's desire and we can love what God loves, never deviating in any way, our speaking will always be accompanied by the Spirit's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, we will be saying something from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the other hand, God's Spirit will carry our word along.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we speak, He will bear our word onward.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the preaching of the New Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the ministry of the word in the New Testament.</S>
