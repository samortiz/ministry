   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AT THE CENTER OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another thing we have to consider is what we should do with the local church at the regional center of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are two types of local churches: the general local church and the local church at the regional center of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually there is not much difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is only a small difference related to the place of apostles in that local church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A LOCAL CHURCH HAVING ELDERS,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>DEACONS, AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a place like Philippi, for example, you can see that there were elders, deacons, and brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Philippians 1:1 says very clearly, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, this letter was written to all the believers, the overseers, and the deacons in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the arrangement within a general local church: There are overseers, deacons, and brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AN EXTRA GROUP, THE APOSTLES, BEING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>IN THE LOCALITY AT THE CENTER OF THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is somewhat different if you are in a local church at the center of the work because there is an extra group, the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In every locality the overseers always administrate the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the locality where the regional center of the work is, there are the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Apostles Also Being Elders</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The apostles administrate the work in a certain region.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The apostles are for the work, but at the same time they also administrate the local church there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, when the apostles are in the locality which is a regional center of the work, they are there as apostles on the one hand and as overseers, elders, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostles care for the work in a certain region or area.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps the word region is too formal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as you know what it means, that is good enough; we are not fighting over words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The apostles administrate the work in a certain area, and they also administrate the affairs of the local church at the center of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, the apostles should not directly administrate a local church in their status as apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the apostles at the same time become the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible shows us that when the church held a conference to discuss how to handle matters in the church which only happened once in the Bible , they sent out letters saying, The apostles and the elder brothers... in Jerusalem Acts 15:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here I want to point out to you that Peter was an apostle, even a leader among the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, Peter was also an elder in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Peter 5:1 says, The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Please remember that Peter was not only an apostle but also an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second John 1 says, The elder to...</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Third John 1 says, The elder to...</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Peter 1:1 Peter tells us that he was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He wrote the Epistle as an apostle, but in 5:1 he shows us that he was also an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the beginning of his second and third Epistles, John said that he was an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is quite peculiar that, unlike Paul or Peter, John does not mention that he was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the beginning of each Epistle, Paul shows us that he wrote the Epistle as an apostle, but John, in his second and third Epistles, says in a simple and straightforward way that it was an elder who wrote the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, you can see that the two greatest apostles in Jerusalem were also elders in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Peter and John, the two most renowned among the apostles in Jerusalem, were elders in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With the exception of James, there is no record that any of the other apostles in Jerusalem were elders.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the book of Acts, Peter, John, and James are three noted apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Epistles tell us that two of them were elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During the conference of the church, James was the one who made the final decision.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the history of the church and the word of the Bible, we can see that he was an elder in Jerusalem at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, according to the Bible, James was ahead of Peter, since it was James who decided on matters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, in the church where there is a regional center of the work, you can let the local brothers, the dependable, elderly ones who have the spiritual weight, learn to oversee.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the same time, there are workers who are the elders of the local church on the one hand and the apostles in that region on the other hand.</S>
