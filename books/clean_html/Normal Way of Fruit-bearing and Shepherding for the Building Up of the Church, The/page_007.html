<h2 class="head1">HAVING A HEART OF LOVE TO CARE FOR PEOPLE</h2>
<p>We have tried many ways to gain the increase, but little has worked. Recently, we changed from preaching the gospel in the meeting every week so that the saints could do the preaching in their homes. However, almost no saints opened their home for the gospel. This caused me to have much concern before the Lord. There is no way that works if we do not have a care for and interest in people. However, if we do have a care and interest, the care itself will open up a way. We should not say that we have no way or that no one will accept the gospel. Even the closed doors of China were eventually opened, and thousands were saved. The work in China was very difficult at the beginning. At first when one missionary went to visit the villages, no one would open the door. The children would even throw stones and mud at him. Still, he would not run away. He would stop, turn around, and say, &ldquo;Thank you. That is enough.&rdquo; The love and endurance that this brother had for the sake of the people eventually touched their heart. The way of the gospel in every Chinese village was difficult. If we had thought that there was no need to go to places like that, then we would have had no way there.</p>
<p>If we had a burden, a care, and an interest for people, we could have brought in a hundred people in the last few months. Because some said that it was too difficult for the saints to bring people to the gospel meeting, we tried letting the saints preach in their homes. Eventually, however, there was no preaching in the homes. It is not that we are short of ways; it is that we are short of heart.</p>
<p>When the missionaries came to my province, the clans in each village would not allow anyone to rent a house to the &ldquo;foreign devils.&rdquo; Because of this, some of the missionaries were forced to live under bridges and underpasses. In addition, no one was allowed to sell them food. It seems that they had no way to live, but the Lord had a way. One family of missionaries who lived in an underpass observed a peddler of soy bean cakes who passed by early each morning. One morning while the peddler left his cakes unattended, the missionary took a piece and put some money in its place, several times more than what the cake was worth. When the peddler returned, he found that a piece was gone but that the money had been left in its place. This went on morning after morning for a long time. Finally the peddler waited to see who was buying his cakes. He and the missionary made contact, and the peddler was saved. Under no situation should we say that there is no way. It altogether depends upon the kind of heart we have. In principle, the situation in the United States, the most modern nation on the earth, is the same today as it was in old China. The devil at that time was the ancient serpent, but today he is more modern. The same serpent uses different ways to keep people from the Lord. Therefore, we need a praying spirit and a heart to love and care for people. If we have this kind of heart and an intensified care for people, the way will be opened.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RESCUED FROM<br />
A FORMAL, LUKEWARM CONDITION BY HAVING<br />
A GENUINE HEART OF CARE FOR OTHERS</h2>
<p>After being in this country for over fourteen years, I have observed that many brothers are desirous for the eldership. In their consideration, the only way for them to be useful is to be an elder. They think that if they cannot be an elder, at least they must be a leader of a service group. Even the sisters desire to be leading ones among the other sisters. I have prayed concerning this situation with a great feeling of shame. In the church there should be no such ambition. We need to forget about titles and position. To be useful is not only to be in the eldership; to be useful is to pick up a burden for souls. A certain older brother who is now with the Lord was a good example to us. He was neither an elder, a co-worker, or any kind of leader, but he was used much by the Lord. He had a heart for the young people, the new ones, and new beginners. Almost every new one was invited to dinner by him. If we would all be like this, the church life will be marvelous.</p>
<p>The United States was built up not by its presidents but by the people, those who built up their own families in the proper way. To be sure, we need good leaders in the church life, but even more, we need every saint to be built up. Each one should say, &ldquo;I love my Master, I love my wife, and I love my children. I will not go out free. I will carry out the proper service in the church. I do not care whether the meetings are high or low, living or dead, rich or poor, or hot or cold. I simply have a burden to care for at least four younger ones all year round. I love the Lord, I have a heart for the unbelievers, and I love my younger brothers and sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without being conscious of it, we have drifted into a lukewarm situation. At the present time we are drifting backward. Some have said that our meetings are too formal, but it is we ourselves who have become formal. Regardless of the way we take in the church meetings, we need to be living in our Christian life. To be the same as we were last week, last month, and even last year is the real &ldquo;formality.&rdquo; There is no need to consider the condition of the meetings; what about our own living? A strong church can be living even without formal meetings, but it seems that now we have meetings without being living. The proper church life is twenty-five percent a matter of the meetings and seventy-five percent a matter of our living, but we have turned it around to be less than twenty-five percent a matter of our living. If we did not have the meetings, there would be no church life left.</p>
<p>We need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. According to our numbers, we have enough saints to begin a new church in a nearby city. Because of our shortage in life, however, we dare not do this. The Lord can testify how much I have prayed. In my prayer I have thanked the Lord for all those who have been brought into His recovery. However, many dear ones who have been in the church life for a certain time are disappointed regarding their usefulness. Some even think that they cannot be useful unless they are elders or leaders in the practical service. Let us forget about the eldership and pick up a genuine heart to love the sinners and a genuine burden to take care of the younger ones. If we have a will to do this, we will surely be able. If we will all be like the older brother who had no position but always cared for the younger ones, our whole church life will be revolutionized. We must have a change. Our success depends not on our knowledge, way, or skill but on our heart. We need to pray for this and take this word for ourselves.</p>
