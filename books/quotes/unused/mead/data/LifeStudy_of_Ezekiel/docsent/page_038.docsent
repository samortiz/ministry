   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>An Extraordinary Move</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The living creatures have more than one way to move.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, they can move by flying because they have the wings of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They can also move by walking on the calf s hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These two ways of moving are an ordinary move.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when they need to move in a special way, they move by a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On your job you need to move daily by the eagle s wings and the calf s hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you move in this way, your co-workers will see that with you there is something powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You can suffer things which others cannot suffer and you can endure things which others cannot endure because you have the eagle s wings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They can also realize that in your character and behavior you are honest, straight, frank, and sincere, having no crookedness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They will see the eagle s wings and the calf s hoofs upon you, and thus they will be convicted by you in their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition to this kind of move with you on your job, there should also be another kind of move an extraordinary move, the move of a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, because the move of the wheel is with you, some of your co-workers may be gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you should work at a job for several years and nothing happens for the Lord s interests, this indicates that with you there is no move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may consider yourself spiritual and heavenly, but you are lacking the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there is no move of the Lord with you, it is questionable whether you have the eagle s wings, the man s hands, and the calf s hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This may indicate that while you are at work, you are somewhat worldly and that you are not a proper human being; therefore, the move of the Lord is not with you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if you have the eagle s wings, the man s hands, and the calf s hoofs, there will surely be a wheel beside you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The move of the Lord will be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wherever we go, there should be a high and dreadful wheel by us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we move to a certain city, there should be a wheel in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we move to a particular country, there should be a wheel in that country.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The presence of the wheel will prove that we are proper, that is, that we have the eagle s wings, the man s hands, and the calf s hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have pointed out, if we do not have the eagle s wings, the man s hands, and the calf s hoofs, we are not qualified to have a wheel standing beside us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would have the wheel, we need to be the proper living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that we need to experience the blowing of the wind, the overshadowing of the Spirit, and the burning of the Spirit in order to gain much electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also need to have the four faces expressing Christ in an adequate way and the eagle s wings by which we can move and behave in a divine way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, we need the calf s hoofs in order to walk in a straight and sincere way, in a way that convinces others and commends us to their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If this is our situation, then certainly there will be a high and dreadful wheel beside us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This wheel is the move of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Consider the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By reading his Epistles and the book of Acts, we can realize that Paul regarded himself as less than the least of all saints Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even his name, Paul, means little.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul was a little man, yet with him there were the eagle s wings, the man s hands, and the calf s hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, wherever he went, there was a great, high, and dreadful wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The situation should be the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should have the eagle s wings, the man s hands, and the calf s hoofs, and thereby have a great wheel for the Lord s move.</S>
