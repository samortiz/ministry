   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Manifested to Take Away Sins</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 5 says, And you know that that One was manifested that He might take away sins; and sin is not in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word for take away here is the same as that used in John 1:29.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There Christ as the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world, the sin which came into the world through Adam Rom 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here He takes away sins, which are committed by all men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 1 and Romans 5 deal with sin itself that dwells in men Rom 7:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This chapter deals with the fruits of sin, that is, the committing of sins in men s daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both are taken away by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In that One who takes away both sin and sins, there is no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, He did not know sin 2 Cor 5:21 , He did no sin 1 Pet 2:22 , and He was without sin Heb 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This qualified Him to take away both the indwelling sin and the sins committed in men s daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not Sinning Habitually</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 6 John continues, Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him nor known Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To abide in Him is to remain in the fellowship of the divine life and to walk in the divine light 1:2-3, 6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The words does not sin mean not to sin habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is also a condition of the life that abides in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It does not mean that the children of God do not commit sin at all; they may commit sin occasionally.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It means that the regenerated believers who have the divine life and live by it do not practice sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their character and habit is not to sin, but to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Abiding in the Lord is a believer s living; sinning is a sinner s life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this verse John says that everyone who practices sin, living a sinful life, has not seen Him or known Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not to have seen or known the Lord is not to have received any vision of Him or to have any realization of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the condition of an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if we have experienced the Lord, then we have seen Him and known Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To see and know the Lord is to experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Living a Righteous Life</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 7 John says, Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who practices righteousness is righteous, even as that One is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To practice righteousness is to live a righteous life, living uprightly under God s ruling principle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This, according to the following verse, means not to practice sin, and, according to verse 4, not to practice lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the context, righteous here equals pure in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be righteous is to be pure, without any stain of sin, lawlessness, and unrighteousness, even as Christ is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The emphasis of the apostle John is that as long as we are children of God having the divine life and the divine nature, we certainly will habitually live a life of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Devil Sinning from the Beginning</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 8 John goes on to say, He who practices sin is of the Devil, because the Devil sins from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this the Son of God was manifested, that He might undo the works of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse indicates that practices sin v. 4 and sins in this book are synonymous, denoting to live in sin, to commit sin habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a life is of the Devil, whose life is one of sin and who sins habitually from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sin is his nature, and sinning is his character.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 8 the preposition from is used in the absolute sense, that is, from the time when the Devil began to rebel against God, attempting to overthrow God s rule.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ Manifested to Undo the Works of the Devil</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this verse John says that the Son of God was manifested for the purpose of undoing the works of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Greek word translated for this literally means unto this, that is, to this end, for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Devil sins continually from ancient times and begets sinners to practice sin with him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might undo and destroy his sinful deeds that is, condemn, through death on the cross in the flesh Rom 8:3 , sin initiated by him, the evil one; destroy the power of sin, the sinful nature of the Devil Heb 2:14 ; and take away both sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the cross Christ condemned sin, took away sin and sins, and destroyed the power of the Devil.</S>
