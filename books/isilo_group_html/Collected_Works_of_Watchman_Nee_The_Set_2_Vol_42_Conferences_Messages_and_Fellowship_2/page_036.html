Abiding is remaining, and abiding in Christ means that we remain in Christ. To abide in Christ is to consider ourselves in Christ and not in ourselves. If we consider ourselves in ourselves, we will only see ourselves. We will overcome the first time when we look to Christ as our victory. Thereafter we must continue to look to Christ as our victory. We can only have the overcoming life when we are in Christ, and we can only continue to live an overcoming life when we are in Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO DEAL WITH SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS</h2><p>In the meetings, there are often people who speak improper words. The workers should exhort these ones. The way to deal with spiritual problems is not to deal with the problems alone&mdash;that is the way of the law. In order to deal with spiritual problems, one must first find out the cause. For example, a brother who speaks improper words all the time may not be speaking those things consciously; his problem may be elsewhere. Chinese medicine does not deal only with the head when the head hurts; one must consider the body as a whole, because the cause of the illness may be elsewhere. Some brothers have problems with their conduct because they are sick in their spiritual life. In order to change their conduct, they must first change their whole being. It is useless to only change their conduct. Hence, in helping others, we should not try to change their conduct; we should look for the sickness within them and help them to find out the root cause.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING FAITH</h2><p>Faith is a wonderful thing; it substantiates spiritual things and accomplishes God's Word. Satan only works in the envi- ronment and can only attack God's Word from the outside; he cannot attack God directly. God's Word demands our faith. For example, God's Word may say, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household" (Acts 16:31). Satan will tell a person that this is not necessarily so. Some brothers face hardships and oppositions at home. The way to deal with them is not by enduring the unbelief of the family members. Of course, I do not mean that one should allow his family to go on worshipping idols. The way to deal with them is to stand firmly on the promise of God and declare to Satan that one's household shall be saved. However, if one does not have the faith, he will be afraid, change God's Word, and say that His promises are not effectual. Satan will then sing and rejoice. This shows us that we fail only when we do not stand on God's Word. Satan is most afraid of us holding on to God's Word and dealing with him according to it. Hence, we have to stand on God's Word with firm faith. Even if the environment changes, we will not change. If we do this, Satan can do nothing to us. He can stir up adverse environments, but we believe that God's Word is true and unchanging. We can say to Satan, "Do all you can. Let us see what God's Word will do."</p><p>The first thing Satan does in deceiving us is to produce an environment that is opposite to God's Word. The second thing he will do is to tell us that God's promise is not real. He will base his words on the environment he has created. Once I was sick. I prayed and God promised that He would heal me. I had the faith for the healing, but after three weeks, the sickness became worse. Then Satan came and tempted me, saying, "What good is your faith? Your illness is still here." When I prayed again, God rebuked me, saying, "Why are you still praying? I have told you that I will heal you. Why do you still have to pray?" I immediately began to praise. I said, "God, I cannot sleep, and I feel much pain. Satan is troubling me all over. Yet I praise You because Your Word is true. I do not care if I suffer. Only Your Word counts; only it is trustworthy. The environment is just Satan's performance. You alone are faithful and trustworthy." I began to sing Hymn #778 on my bed. That was the best singing I ever experienced in my life. The words in stanza two were particularly precious: "For God delights when faith can praise /Though dark the night and long." Later the Lord did heal me. Satan's work produces only one result&mdash;doubting God's Word, that is, making men wonder whether or not it is true. Outward conditions are not real. If you listen to Satan and look at the adverse environment, you will think that God's Word is not true. But if you stand on God's Word by faith, you will not fear.</p><p>Faith does not require any proof or evidence. When a person has good credit in business, he does not need a guarantee. Only those who do not have good credit need a guarantee. Satan does not have good credit. This is why he asks for a guarantee for everything. He has to furnish facts to guarantee everything he says. The facts he furnishes are often the environments he creates. This is not the way our God works. Our God has very good credit. He does not need any fact, and He does not need any guarantee. His Word alone counts. What can guarantee the words of the Bible? The Bible only uses a few words to tell us the facts about God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and ascension, etc. The Bible does not need any guarantee.</p><p>Today we can commit our spirit, soul, and body to God because we have the word of the Bible. We can give up all things for the Lord because we have the word of the Bible. The Bible produces faith in us. Those whose eyes are set on the environment will not change any fact. But those who praise by faith will see fruitful results.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
