   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In verse 6, God told John, "They have come to pass."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On what ground could God say to John that it is done?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He can say this because He is "the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It often seems that God's work has not been successful, but He says, "I am the Alpha and the Omega."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God made the original design, and God also will bring it to its final completion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How we thank God that He is the Alpha, the initiator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning God..."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the heavens and the earth were created, God purposed all things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All things had their beginning in God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, He is also the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man can and will fail, but God is the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man may say this and man may say that, but God has the last word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God spoke these things because He wants to tell us that He will bring His plan to fulfillment, He will reach His goal, and He will accomplish what He has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We acknowledge that Satan's work has indeed interrupted the work of God, but we further acknowledge that God is not only the Alpha who purposed in the beginning, but also the Omega who will finally succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God never gives up, and He will never let any of His purpose remain unfulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regardless of the church's condition in her present experience, she will have no spot, wrinkle, or any such things in God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, she will be clothed with glory and presented to His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we see God's children differing so much with each other in faith and doctrine as well as in practice, we wonder how it is possible for them to ever come to the oneness of the faith, as spoken of in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We often sigh and say that this could never happen, even if we waited for another two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But God said that He is the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The day will come when He will have a glorious church before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He may use water or He may use fire, but He will certainly have a glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot hinder God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will obtain that which will satisfy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No matter how weak, how indifferent, or how hardened we are, there will be a day when God will smash us to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will break us and shatter us so that we will become what He desires us to be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is the Omega.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since God is doing it, He will pursue it to the end. He will never let up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us praise Him with rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He must attain His goal!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 6 continues, "I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The emphasis here is not upon redemption but upon our need for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The meaning of thirst is a need for God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be without God means that we are without water.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the fountain of the water of life is for the satisfaction of those who are thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we must pay close attention to verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How we thank God for the especially precious promise in this verse, telling us what the overcomers will obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The overcomers spoken of here are different from those mentioned in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The overcomers in chapters two and three are a group from the whole church, while the overcomers spoken of here are connected with "him who thirsts."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The preceding verse says, "I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then verse 7 says, "He who overcomes will inherit these things."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other words, those who drink of the fountain of the water of life are the overcomers spoken of here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These overcomers differ from those who do not drink of this water.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This kind of overcoming is the same as that which is spoken of in 1 John 5:4: "For everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which has overcome the world our faith."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who are begotten of God, those who belong to the Lord, have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who do not belong to the Lord do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And this faith causes us to overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This surely should make us glad and make us rejoice and shout, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the new heaven and new earth we are all overcomers!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The man-child in the age of the kingdom is constituted of a minority, but in the New Jerusalem, the entire Body overcomes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the New Jerusalem it is only a matter of whether or not we have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we have faith, we are an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In that day God will wipe away every tear from our eyes; and death will be no more, neither will there be sorrow, crying, or pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But all these things are negative aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The positive is that "He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verse 7 God also says, "I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, our position before God as Christians is not only as people, but as sons.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God wants to have many sons enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We thank and praise God that He said, "I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no higher blessing in eternity than this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 8 says, "But the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the false, their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Just as the blessing in eternity is a fact, so the punishment in eternity is also a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The punishment from the God of love is unavoidable and inescapable.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a severe warning to everyone.</S>
