   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the eyes of God, we the believers are considered to be one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the Body of Christ, our function is to express Christ, and as the new man, our function is to move, work, act, and do things to accomplish God's great plan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This new man is a corporate and vast man, comprising all God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not consider ourselves as individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must consider ourselves as part of this new man, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition to being the Body and the new man, the church is the habitation of Christ and of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A habitation is a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is like a person's house.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has only one house, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this house, God dwells together with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is a Body to Christ, a new man to God, and a dwelling place to the Spirit, who is the consummation and the aggregate of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the church is the dwelling place of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit who is now consummated as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The way to produce this church, which is the Body of Christ, the new man to accomplish God's eternal economy, and the dwelling place of the Triune God, is by the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the church to become the organic Body to Christ, a living man to God, and a marvelous, living, and organic dwelling place to the Triune God, there is no way other than the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This divine dispensing dispenses nothing else but God Himself as the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The way God dispenses Himself into us is by the Divine Trinity as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Father dispenses Himself through the many works that He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Son dispenses Himself first through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through incarnation He came down from heaven to reach man by being born of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, in His incarnation He could only be near His believers, such as Peter and John; He could not enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, He took a further step by passing through the process of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through His all-inclusive death, He was released from the shell of His humanity, and whatever was in that shell flowed out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Blood came out for redemption, and water also came out for life imparting John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Old Testament type, the living water flowed out of the smitten rock to quench the thirst of the people of Israel Exo 17:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same way, through His death Christ released Himself for the dispensing of His life to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the third step of His process, Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His mysterious resurrection, He, as the last Adam, a genuine man, became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a man, Christ accomplished redemption for us; now, as the life-giving Spirit, He is giving, or dispensing, Himself as the divine life to all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we hear the gospel and call on Him, His life is dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In preaching the gospel, we must not speak according to the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The old way is to sit down and talk with people about God for a long time with no authority, power, or presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every time we go out to preach the gospel, we should pray to be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must go by being one with Christ and with the realization that Christ has sent us and is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way, our going will be with the power and the authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead of talking in a vain way, we will be able to give others the command to believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, most of us did not know very much when we were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we need to do is to baptize people with the authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After they are baptized, we can go back to feed them at a later time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When they are fed, they will grow and will begin to understand the spiritual and divine things concerning God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through this way of preaching, the Divine Trinity is dispensed to others, and the church is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A preacher of the gospel is actually a branch of the vine John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His work is to bear fruit through the dispensing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fruit-bearing is a dispensing; it is not a matter of preaching or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the life of Christ grows within a person, this life will issue in a blossoming, and the blossoming will issue in fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we want to bear fruit, we must learn to be continually filled with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we are filled, the life within us will grow and will flow out and issue in the producing of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the way to produce the believers and the way to build them up into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is altogether a matter of the divine dispensing of life.</S>
