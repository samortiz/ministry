<P>Another manifestation of our fallen situation is our politeness, in the sense of being a kind of politics. That is actually falsehood. You may say that to be polite is to be nice. But you need to be saved from being so nice. The wild people need to be saved from being wild. The nice people need to be saved from being nice. Then we may wonder whether we should be wild or nice. But whether we are wild or nice, we are still fallen. We need to be saved from everything of the fall. We need to be saved from our being nice or wild. We are saved not by teaching, but by Christ as life.</P><P>Some people are naturally emotional. Generally speaking, the northern people from the cold region are rather conservative. When they are happy, they are happy within. It is really hard for us to know that they are happy. They are hiddenly and conservatively happy. But the southerners from the tropical zone are more emotional and easily excited. Maybe they are not that happy, yet they express themselves as being very happy. The northerners need to be saved from their being conservative and the southerners need to be saved from their being excited. They both need to be saved in Christ's life. Christ is not so conservative or so excited. The southerners need to be cooled down a little bit by Christ being life to them. When the Lord fed the five thousand with five loaves and two fish, He was very calm. He did not jump up and say, "Hallelujah!" The disciples may have been excited, but the Lord Jesus was calm and told them to pick up all the fragments and put them into baskets (Matt. 14:14-21).</P><P>Christ as life to us saves us from what we are. If you are slow, Christ will save you from your slowness. If you are quick, Christ will be your life to save you from your quickness. We had a co-worker among us whom I met in 1934. Brother Watchman Nee told me concerning this brother that if you tell him to go east, he will go west. If you said yes, he would say no. So it was very easy for you to get along with him. If you wanted him to go east, you just needed to ask him to go west. Then he would go east. Many times when we say no, the Lord says yes. When we say yes, the Lord says no.</P><P>If you are a slow person, the Lord will ask you to hurry. If you are a quick person, the Lord will tell you to be patient. This is according to Christ as life, not the law. We all need to be saved from what we are. If you like to laugh, the Lord says, "Don't laugh." If you like to be quiet, the Lord says, "Be excited." The Lord will say to the northern Canadians, "Be excited," and to the southern Mexicans, "Be quiet."</P><P>We are fallen people. Whatever we are is in a fallen condition. Do not keep anything of what you are naturally. We need to be saved from our natural condition, from what we are naturally. Some may ask whether it is right to be quiet or to be excited. Our answer is that neither is right or wrong. If the Lord saves you to be excited, you have to be excited. If the Lord saves you to be calm, you have to be calm. It is up to Him. There is no legality. But I do know that the Lord's salvation, the Lord's deliverance, is always against our nature.</P>
