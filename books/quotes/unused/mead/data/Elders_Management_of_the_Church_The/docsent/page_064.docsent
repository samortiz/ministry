   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It is regrettable to see elders serving together without having the consciousness that they have to be in coordination in order to be capable in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we see that members of the same body do not have the same function, we will realize that the gifts of the elders are also different.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some must be the hand, others the foot, the eye, or the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, you cannot expect every elder to have discernment; some elders need others to be their discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some elders may be very discerning, yet they are not warm; they need others' warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times, those who are fervent in heart are blind in their eyes, and those who are sharp in their eyes are cold in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The clearer a person sees, the colder his heart becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more fervently a person loves, the more foolish he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why we must all coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those with sharp eyes need others to be their heart, and those who are too fervent in heart need others to be their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, you may feel a certain brother is very lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must not love him without consideration; instead, you should first bring the matter to the fellowship among the elders and allow the discerning ones to judge the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you accept this coordination, you will have discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, if you have discernment, there is no need for you to exercise this discernment directly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do, you will probably become a knife or a gun to others; you are too sharp, and therefore you must be coordinated with someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You can be to others their discernment, and others can be to you your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps a message needs to be given, but you cannot give the message because you do not have the gift of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have only the discernment; you cannot be the mouthpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can then present your feeling to the elders in fellowship and accept the coordination of those elders who are the speaking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they speak, you will feel that it is not they alone who are speaking, but the speaking of the elders in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this speaking, there is discernment, as well as warm love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Apparently, in this message, some of the elders release their words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually, the message is the result of the fellowship of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this fellowship, there is discernment and warmth, as well as spiritual light and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a message, but within it is the coordination that includes all kinds of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers, I do hope that the elders in all the localities would manifest all the gifts this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to do this, there must be the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You cannot depend on yourself all the time, thinking that you have utterance, foresight, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not believe in this, and I hope you would not believe in this either.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps you have only foresight, but you do not have love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps you have only love but are poor in your sight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if you possess both, your mouth may not be capable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not put too much trust in yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The elders must fellowship together; they must put their love into the fellowship, their foresight into the fellowship, their light of life, and their experience into the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After this, one or two elders can be the utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only then will this utterance include everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I believe the brothers and sisters can see the riches, strength, and beauty of this coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the elders need to be capable in everything, they must be in coordination.</S>
