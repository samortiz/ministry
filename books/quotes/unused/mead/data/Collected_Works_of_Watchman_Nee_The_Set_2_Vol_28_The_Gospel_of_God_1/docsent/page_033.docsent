   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REDEMPTION AND SUBSTITUTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we have to ask one question.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the Lord Jesus died on the cross and since God made Him the propitiation place, how can we be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the difference between redemption and substitution?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Are they similar in any way?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to realize that the work of the Lord Jesus is a work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the result of this redemptive work is substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Redemption is the cause, and substitution is the result.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The scope of redemption is very large.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the scope of substitution is not quite as large.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is quite interesting that the Bible never says that the Lord Jesus died on behalf of the sins of all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It only says that the Lord Jesus died on behalf of all 2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His redemptive work was to satisfy the righteous requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Lord accomplished redemption on the cross, this work of redemption had absolutely nothing to do with man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I want to impress you strongly with this word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Redemption is absolutely not related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The work of redemption is between God and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the work of redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is God Himself coming to the world to solve the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once the problem of sin is solved, the work of redemption is done.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The blood of the Passover lamb was sprinkled on the side posts and upper posts of the doors Exo 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God said that when He saw the blood, He would pass over the house v. 13 . The blood was for God to see.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was not for the firstborn to see.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The firstborn did not need to see the blood; they stayed in the houses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The blood was to meet God's righteous requirements; it was not to meet the requirements of the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the firstborn, there was no such thing as redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we read the Old Testament, we will discover that the blood for the atonement i.e., redemption of sin was brought into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was sprinkled on the veil seven times Lev 16:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the day of Atonement, the high priest had to take the blood and sprinkle it on the mercy seat of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The blood was offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is true that the blood had to be smeared on the thumb, the ear, and the toe of a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But that was done with respect to consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was a matter of consecration to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man had no such requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Redemption has to do with God; it is God coming in to solve what man cannot solve by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why the Bible says, "And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world" 1 John 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Redemption includes the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In such a redemption, everyone, even those that have not been saved, are included.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has come and dealt with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus has satisfied God's righteous requirements so that we can receive the substitution of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His redemption is an abstract preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By believing in Him, this redemption becomes a substitution to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before God, it was not a substitution, but a redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is important to know this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are not clear about this matter, we will be confused about many other doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Redemption is before God, and substitution is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Redemption is to satisfy God's requirements, and substitution is for us to receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What He accomplished was redemption; what we have received is substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not mean that there is no such teaching as substitution in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is indeed such a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But all the teachings in the Bible concerning substitution are written for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are not written for unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To the Gentiles we say that Jesus has died for them and accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To the Christians we say that the Lord Jesus has substituted them in bearing their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the passage that we have read from Isaiah 53, notice that it says, "But He was pierced because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed" v. 5 . Please observe that it says "our" instead of "your." He bore the suffering for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, our sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is for us and not for the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When Peter quoted Isaiah 53, he said, "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree" 1 Pet 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was always "our" and not "your."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, we have to be careful when we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is better that we adhere more to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible never says to sinners that Jesus died for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible says that Jesus died for them Rom 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is such a thing as Jesus dying for them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But there is no such thing as Jesus dying for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For Jesus to die for them is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But the problem of sin is not solved yet.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is true that all the problems of sin are solved before God already.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if one has not participated in this work, his sins are not yet solved, and he has no part in the substitution of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When one receives the Lord Jesus, his problem of sin is taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Without this, there is no substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In other words, redemption has been accomplished, but salvation has not yet been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If I were to ask you when you were redeemed, you should reply that it transpired two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if I were to ask you when you were saved, you should say that it happened in a certain year on a certain day and month.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Redemption is something that happened long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Salvation is something present.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Redemption was accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Salvation is realized in us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We were redeemed two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But we may have been saved for only a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I do not know how to say it more clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is very clear to me.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God's work of redemption is a matter regarding Himself; it is to satisfy Himself and has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is something absolutely before God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God Himself was the One who did the work.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we come and see what God has accomplished, and believe and accept it, we will receive this substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Let us use another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There is a crossing that joins the east and west bank of the Whampoa river.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The name of the place is called The Free Crossing.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Suppose I were a robber who had robbed and stolen many times there.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>However, now I am different.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What should I do if I want to have a thorough dealing concerning my past theft and robbery?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Even if I want to repay, where should I go?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Those from whom I stole are now nowhere to be found.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>For the sake of righteousness and in order to repay, I may start a free service to ferry people across the river.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Anyone can come for the ride, and no money is charged.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I may do this to repay the money that I stole from people in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I offer this kind of free service as a solution to the problem of my unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This free service is to me a solution to unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But to others, it is a substitution; I am paying the fare on others' behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is the way that the Lord Jesus deals with the problem of punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>God sent the Lord Jesus to accomplish redemption in order that the problem of sin, as well as His own holiness and righteousness, might be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When one believes, he will enter into this work, and the Lord Jesus will take away his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Hence, the New Testament says, "Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous" 1 Pet 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He "Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree" 1 Pet 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>All of these were done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>On the night the Lord was betrayed, He took the cup and blessed it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, "This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins," Matt 26:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>It was for many, not for all.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In the future, we will see innumerable ones, with palm branches in their hands, who are washed by the blood Rev 7:9, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He accomplished redemption for His own sake, so that we can be substituted.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We can say nothing but to thank and praise Him.</S>
