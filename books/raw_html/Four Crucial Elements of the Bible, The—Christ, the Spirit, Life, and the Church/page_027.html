<h2 class=head2>The Essential Spirit and the Economical Spirit</h2><p>When Christ came out to minister at the age of thirty for the accomplishing of the commission which He had received from God, the Spirit of God descended upon Him (Matt. 3:16). Matthew 1:18, 20 and Luke 1:35 unveil to us that Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit as His essence. Then at His baptism, the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, descended upon Him again. This was related to His ministry, His work. These are not two Spirits but two aspects of one Spirit. The Holy Spirit as the essence of Jesus in His conception and birth was His divine life, and He lived by this Spirit as His essence and life. The essence of the divine element of the Holy Spirit, who was His life and nature, was unchangeable and irremovable. However, the Holy Spirit also has the economical aspect, the aspect of power, which was for the ministry of Jesus (Luke 4:14, 18; Matt. 12:28) and could be removed from Him when there was the need for it (Matt. 27:46).<p>Jesus had the Holy Spirit in the essential aspect as His intrinsic nature from His conception and birth, but it was at His baptism that the Holy Spirit in the economical aspect descended upon Him as His outward power. The Bible clearly records that the Lord Jesus ministered not by His own strength but by this Spirit. Within, He was constituted and filled with the essential Spirit; without, He was anointed and empowered by, as well as filled with, the economical Spirit. He was a person altogether wrapped up with the Spirit. Hence, His move was the Spirit’s move, and His work was the Spirit’s work.<h2 class=head2>Another Comforter</h2><h2 class=head3>The Promise of the Comforter</h2><p>On the last night of His three-and-a-half-year ministry, the Lord Jesus had a long discourse with His disciples which is recorded in John 14—16. This section was a word of farewell from the Lord Jesus to His disciples on the night of His betrayal. In this parting word, He first said that He is the expression of the Father; when people see Him, they see the Father. He is in the Father, and the Father is in Him, and He and the Father are one (14:9-10). Then in verses 16 and 17 He said, “And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality.” Nearly every Christian knows that what the Lord Jesus spoke of here was the promise to give us a Comforter, but they do not understand how the Father gave us the Comforter.<h2 class=head3>Another Comforter, the Son Who Was in Them</h2><p>The Lord went on to say that this Comforter, the Spirit of reality, would abide with the disciples and would be in them (v. 17). The Lord had been with the disciples for three and a half years, they truly enjoyed His presence, and He was their Comforter, but now He was going to leave them. When they heard this, they were very sorrowful. Therefore, the Lord wanted them to know that at that time He could only be with them outwardly, but He could not enter into them. Although the Lord in the flesh could be with the disciples and could walk, stay, and abide with them, He was not satisfied with this. He desired to enter into the believers that He might live in them as their life. Moreover, He wanted to be their bread of life and life supply. In other words, He wanted to be the “another Comforter.” Therefore, the “another Comforter” was Christ entering into them to be their life and life supply. Since He was to be life to them, He could not be merely outside of them but had to be inside of them. Since He was to be their bread of life and life supply, He had to be received into them that He might minister to them. Hence, although the disciples were delighted with the Lord’s outward presence, that was not good enough; the Lord aspired to enter into them.
