   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hymns, #945 The Son of God has come to sow</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Himself, the seed of life, in man,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That thru Himself God s Kingdom grow</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And thus fulfill th eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was the only grain of wheat</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whence many grains have been produced</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be the Kingdom s children meet,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thru whom God s reign is introduced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But Satan, enemy of God,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sowed many tares among the wheat,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Kingdom s children to confuse,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And awful damage to create.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Tis by this subtle work of his,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The mixing of the tares with wheat,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Kingdom in appearance is</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Abnormal and grotesquely great.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Kingdom should as mustard be,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A little herb, yet good for food,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But it has changed into a tree,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A system of great magnitude.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead of being good for food,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A lodge of birds it has become;</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Tis now a place where evil men</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And evil spirits make their home.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A great religion of the world</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Its outward form to us reveals,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Including pagan, evil things,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As leaven mingled with the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A system of the world as such,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It thus has changed in outward form;</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By evil things which it imbibes,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Corruption inwardly doth swarm.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But something hidden God doth seek,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As pearl and treasure in the field ;</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As such the Lord would us transform</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That pearl and treasure be revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Tis hidden from vast Christendom</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And from the Kingdom s great fa ade,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet in its full reality</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Tis transformed like to Christ and God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lord, separate us from the tares,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And save us from the monstrous tree ;</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From all the leaven purge us now</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That we may purely be of Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May Thou in life transform our souls</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hymns, #947 God s Kingdom today is a real exercise,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But when Christ comes to reign it will be</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>a great prize;</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is wisdom divine that we now may be trained</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His Son,</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And we need to be trained that we may overcome</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And to know how to rule in His Kingdom as kings,</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That His kingship thru us be expressed o er</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>all things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today we must learn to submit to His throne,</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How to have a strict life and His government own;</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His authority then we ll be able to share,</S>

   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For its manifestation prepared thus to reign.</S>

   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>from God</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Will to us grant His kingship to share as reward;</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thus the Lord will His righteousness thru us maintain</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>And His wisdom to heavenly powers make plain.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For this the Apostle pressed on at all cost,</S>
