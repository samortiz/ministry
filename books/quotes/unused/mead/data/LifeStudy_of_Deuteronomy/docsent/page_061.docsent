   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning Taking a Pledge from the Borrower</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Deuteronomy 24:10-13 speaks concerning taking a pledge from the borrower.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>a. The Lender Not Entering</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>the Borrower's House but Standing Outside</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the children of Israel lent anything to their neighbor, they were not to enter his house in order to take his pledge v. 10 . Rather, they were to stand outside, and the borrower was to bring the pledge out to them v. 11 . These small points indicate that our God is detailed in His care for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lender Returning</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>the Pledge before the Sun Went Down</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 12 and 13 go on to say, "If he is a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge; you must return his pledge to him when the sun goes down, so that he may sleep in his mantle and bless you; and it will be righteousness to you before Jehovah your God."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the lender did not return the pledge by sundown, the borrower could accuse him before God, saying, "Lord, my lender will not let me have my mantle, and I have nothing to sleep in."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not returning the mantle could cause the lender to have suffering instead of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if he returned the mantle before the sun went down, the borrower would bless him, and God would count the lender's returning the mantle as righteousness before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning the Wages Given</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>to the Poor Hired Servant</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 24:14 and 15 we have a word concerning the wages given to the poor hired servant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The children of Israel were not to oppress a poor and needy hired servant among their brothers or among the sojourners with them v. 14 . On the day that the hired servant earned his wages, the children of Israel were to give him his wages before the sun went down v. 15a . They were not to owe anything to the one who worked for them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, he could cry against them to Jehovah, and it would become sin in them v. 15b .</S>
