<p>The contents of the Minor Prophets include God&rsquo;s economy in His loving chastisement of Israel, Christ as the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy, and a number of crucial points.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. God&rsquo;s Economy<br />
in His Loving Chastisement of Israel</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy in His loving chastisement of Israel, in His governmental dealing with Israel, and in His judgment upon the nations issues in the manifestation of Christ as the centrality and universality in God&rsquo;s economy to bring in the restoration. According to Psalm 2, Christ, God&rsquo;s King, is the Lord, the Possessor, of the earth. The entire world is under Christ as the &ldquo;General Manager.&rdquo; He is not only the Lord but also the Manager, managing the entire world situation. At present this is somewhat hidden, but one day He will be manifested. God&rsquo;s economy on this earth will eventually issue in the manifestation of Christ. When this manifestation takes place, all people will see that Christ is the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy to bring in the age of restoration. This is the first aspect of the contents of the Minor Prophets, an emphasis which is also found in the Major Prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Christ as the Centrality<br />
and Universality of God&rsquo;s Economy</h2>
<p>In the Minor Prophets Christ as the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy is emphatically unveiled. In the Minor Prophets (not counting Zechariah, which reveals other aspects of Christ) this unveiling, this revelation concerning Christ, has sixteen points. We will now briefly consider these points according to the sequence of the facts.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. In His Eternal Origin</h2>
<p>We have pointed out that Micah 5:2c says that Christ&rsquo;s &ldquo;goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; This refers to Christ&rsquo;s eternal origin.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. In His Human Birth in Bethlehem</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2a says that from Bethlehem would come forth the One who would be the Ruler in Israel. This is the only verse in the entire Old Testament which tells us that Christ was to be born in Bethlehem.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. In His First Coming as the Messenger of God</h2>
<p>Malachi 3:1-3 reveals that in His first coming Christ came as the Messenger of God. As God&rsquo;s Messenger, He brought people God&rsquo;s word, God&rsquo;s message. This word, this message, is actually Christ Himself. We may say that He is the letter sent by God to us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. In His Union with Israel as the Son of God<br />
Loved by God and Called Out of Egypt by God</h2>
<p>Hosea 11:1 says, &ldquo;When Israel was a child, I loved him, / And out of Egypt I called My son.&rdquo; This speaks of Christ in His union with Israel as the Son of God loved by God and called out of Egypt by God. The fulfillment of this prophecy is in Matthew 2. Not long after Christ was born, while He was still in His babyhood, Herod tried to kill Him. But according to the word of an angel, Joseph took Jesus and His mother and departed into Egypt and remained there &ldquo;until the death of Herod, in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, &lsquo;Out of Egypt I called My Son&rsquo;&rdquo; (v. 15).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. In His Death and Resurrection<br />
for the Salvation of God to Sinners</h2>
<p>A further aspect of Christ is typified by the prophet Jonah. Jonah was swallowed by a great fish and was vomited out of it for the spreading of God&rsquo;s salvation to the Gentile Ninevites (Jonah 1:17; 2:10). This is a type of Christ in His death and resurrection for the salvation of God to sinners, even to the Gentiles (Matt. 12:39-41).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. In His Being the Desire of All the Nations</h2>
<p>In Haggai 2:7 we see that Christ is the Desire of all the nations. Even though the nations do not know Christ, they still desire to have Christ. All the nations desire to have peace and a good life, but the situation in the world is the opposite of this. Christ is peace; Christ is also the good life. For the nations to desire these things means that they actually desire Christ. He is the Desire of all the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. In Elijah&rsquo;s Being Sent before Him<br />
to Prepare the Way for His Coming Back</h2>
<p>Elijah will be sent before Christ to prepare the way for His coming back (Mal. 4:5-6; 3:1a; Rev. 11:3-4).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of the Minor Prophets &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
