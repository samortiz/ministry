Yet they desire to live an overcoming life. They aspire to overcome their temper, fleshly lusts, unclean thoughts, and pride. They employ all kinds of means, hoping that they will reach God's standard. However, their methods do not bring them the victory that the Bible speaks of. Let us consider the great difference between man's thought and God's thought, and the great difference between man's work and God's work. We can use temper as an illustration. Temper is a common sin. First Corinthians 13 is on love; both the first and last sentence relate to endurance or longsuffering. Being patient is not losing one's temper. There are a few common ways that man uses to deal with his temper.</p><h2 class="head2">Suppression</h2><p>Suppressing one's temper is like trying to seal the lid of a bottle. When one's temper is about to burst, he tries to suppress it. He tries to swallow his anger. But swallowing one's anger is not genuine endurance. In her book, The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life, Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith mentioned the example of a girl who stayed with her aunt. One day someone rebuked her aunt for no reason, yet the aunt continued to smile. The girl saw this and afterwards admired her aunt, saying, "All my life I have admired your patience. If I had to talk to such an unreasonable person, my anger would flare up immediately." The aunt replied, "Perhaps there is something you do not know. Do not think that I was not angry. Although anger did not come out of my mouth, my heart was burning with anger."</p><p>A brother was hit once by another Christian on the cheek. He said, "I will overcome by Christ. Christ has given me the power to overcome." Yet in his heart he was cursing the one who hit him. This is not genuine victory. The victory that the Bible speaks of is a victory that does not become agitated in the heart. Stephen's victory was a victory in which he prayed for his persecutors; he did not have any feelings of revenge whatsoever (Acts 7:60). Genuine victory is one that is not touched or moved by anything. Swallowing one's anger is a man-made victory. Victory is not a matter of mustering one's strength to suppress oneself in the hope of not sinning and of attaining to perfection. Victory is a matter of inward transcendency before God. It has no animosity whatsoever.</p><h2 class="head2">Taming the Flesh</h2><p>The most common way to tame the flesh is by trying to mellow the temper. The Chinese have an idiomatic expression that describes this: "Taming the dragons and subduing the tigers." This is the way many people suppress their temper. They try to turn a wild horse into a tame horse. Many people think that what they need is more time to tame their temper and cultivate their character. They think that victory is the ability to tame themselves. When I was in Peking, I met a brother who was over seventy years old. He had a quick temper. I asked him, "How was your temper thirty-nine years ago?" He answered, "Thirty-nine years ago, my temper was much worse than it is now. I am over seventy years old, and my temper is naturally more subdued." This is not genuine victory. The victory that the Lord gives is always instantaneous. Your salvation is instantaneous. Your victory is also instantaneous. Both your salvation and victory are works that the Lord has accomplished. You do not become subdued slowly, and you do not improve gradually.</p><p>Once I was in a restaurant, and I accidently spilled some soy sauce onto a waiter's clothing. In front of everyone he said, "It does not matter, sir." But behind my back he cursed me, saying, "This man has his eyes in the wrong place!" This is the victory most Christians talk about today. This is man-made victory and is worthless in the eyes of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Warring with Sin</h2><p>Another group of people deal with sin by wrestling with it and trying to withstand it. They struggle to oppose sin in the hope that they will overcome it. Yet their striving, struggling, and wrestling eventually end in nothing but failure. These people often think that they have failed because they did not fight with sin long enough and were not resolute enough in rejecting sin. They try to fight harder the next time, and they do their best to withstand. Yet how many people have we seen who have overcome their sin through wrestling with it? The Bible tells us to withstand the devil, but it never tells us to withstand temptation. It tells us to withstand evil, but it never tells us to withstand sin. None of our temptations and trials can be overcome through withstanding them.</p><p>A young brother was working for the Lord in a certain locality. Once while he was conducting a meeting and was helping others to have the overcoming experience, a seventy-nine-year-old doctor came and listened to his preaching. This doctor had been smoking cigars for fifty-one years. He told others, "Smoking is my habit; I have been smoking since my youth. Originally I smoked twelve cigars a day. Now I have increased to twenty a day. I have been smoking for fifty-one years, and there is no way that I can overcome it." The young brother asked, "How do you deal with it?" The doctor said, "I have been wrestling with smoking for over twenty years but have never succeeded." Another young brother who was there smiled and said, "I overcame without any wrestling on my part. If you want to overcome sin, you can never do it by yourself. You have to trust in God's deliverance. There is no need for you to struggle in yourself." The brother proceeded to explain to the doctor the way of victory. In the end they prayed. In his prayer the doctor said, "Lord, from now on, I will stop all my wrestling. Lord, I trust in You. Victory is Yours. I cannot overcome by wrestling with my own strength." Three months later, he testified, saying, "I have been smoking for fifty-one years. Yet in an instant I was delivered from it. Formerly, when I woke up in the morning, my hand would reach out for a cigar before I opened my eyes. Yet on that day, I stopped suddenly; the thought for smoking was gone. Christ has indeed become my victory." Victory does not come by struggling through one's own strength. It is Christ in us who becomes our victory. Victory over sin is just one small item of the work of Christ within us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 74</div><br></body></html>
