   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PSALM 46 GOD MEETING OUR NEEDS IN THE CITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"God is our refuge and strength, a very ready help in trouble" v. 1 . Where is God our refuge, our strength, and a very ready help in trouble? In the city! God is all this to us in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 2 and 3 then tell us something as a background for the city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Selah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a river."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is a sea in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The sea is in the earth, but in the city there is a river, "the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This river signifies the flowing of God Himself as life to us; it signifies the river of life, which is mentioned in Revelation 22.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The river of life is nothing less than God Himself in Christ through the Spirit as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The streams of this river make glad the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we know that the city of God is the church strengthened, built up, and enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Psalms 46 through 48 the church has become the city over which God rules and from which God reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not just the house for the Father's home, but also the city for God's rule in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The city of God is the enlarged, strengthened, and built-up church as the ruling center of God in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is in this city that we have the river.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The picture here corresponds to that of the New Jerusalem found in Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In those chapters we also see a city with a flowing river.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we have a river with many streams to make the city glad.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are so very happy because of this river, this flow of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we did not have the flow of life, we would be shriveled and withered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our joy would be gone; there would be no gladness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are the most joyful people because in the city, in the church, we have a flow of living water not just a trickle, but a river.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This holy city of God is "the holy place of the tabernacles or habitations of the most High" v. 4 . You must pay attention to all these titles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The most high God dwells here; this is the holy place of His habitations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then verse 5 says, "God is in the midst of her" in the midst of the enlarged church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"She shall not be moved."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The earth will be moved and the mountains will be carried away, but the city will never be moved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the immovable God is within her.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is immovable; so she is immovable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"God shall help her at the dawn of the morning."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are in the local church, we are in the morning; if we are outside the local church, we are simply in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church there is always the dawn of the morning, and when you are in the morning, God is your help.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"God shall help her at the dawn of the morning," after the night of trial.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 6: "The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because He is in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verses 7 through 10: "The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Selah.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Be still, and know that I am God."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These verses are a kind of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When God has a church on this earth so strengthened and enlarged that it may be reckoned as a city, He will then have the ground to deal with the nations and possess the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The nations today are raging.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But God will one day obtain a church as a city, and at that time He will say to all the nations, "Be still, and know that I am God."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God could not say this today, for He lacks such a strong church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God has not yet obtained a stronghold on this earth for Him to speak in such a way to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But He will have it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 10 continues, "I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When God has a church so strengthened, so much enlarged and built up as a city to Him, He can say, "I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Finally, in the city we may say, "The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.</S>
