   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Handling of Real and Liquid Assets</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Third, at the time of Acts, the emphasis was on the disposal of real assets, not liquid assets.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The properties, possessions, lands, and houses in Acts 2:44-45 and 4:32-35 were all real assets.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Family treasures such as antiques and hoarded goods must be disposed of.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not have any attachment to real assets; they have to be dealt with in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once we dispose of the real assets, we lose all of our roots on this earth, and all problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The real assets are items that have bound us to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to help the brothers and sisters to be happy; we have to make them willing to be rootless persons on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, we have to take care of practical needs as well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even those who sell their real estate should not give up their own dwellings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not decide for others whether or not they should sell their lands or houses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In consideration of the present state of affairs, it may be better for some brothers and sisters to keep their dwellings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As for their accompanying liquid assets, we have to go back to the teaching of John the Baptist when he spoke to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said that those who have two garments should give one to those who have not, and those who have food should do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the biblical pattern is that liquid assets are given away, while real assets are sold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the brothers and sisters have extra clothing, they can ask the church to give it away for them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church can find out who the needy ones are and dispose of many items this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are too many poor ones outside the church, and we cannot take care of all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should, however, take care of our brothers and sisters; we cannot allow them to remain in want.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot ignore their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a shameful thing if our brothers and sisters are not clothed warmly and fed adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The possessions we have today are partly real assets and partly liquid assets.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The principle of disposal is to sell the real assets and to give away the liquid assets.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Stock is halfway between a real asset and a liquid asset.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, it is more a real asset than a liquid asset; it is in the nature of an investment asset.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who own lands and houses should dispose of them according to practical considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In some cases the brothers who own lands should continue to farm them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to be firm with the principle but sensitive to the actual needs in the outworking of this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not do anything in an extreme way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is harmful to be short or to overdo.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Conducting One's Own Sale</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fourth, in selling one's all, a brother or a sister has to take care of the sales personally.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is not an auction fair.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The brothers and sisters should sell their own possessions and bring the proceeds to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At Pentecost the believers sold their lands and houses and brought the money to the feet of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They sold the goods themselves, and they were clear as to how much they profited or lost.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one knows a person's possessions more clearly than the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If these goods are handed over to the church, the church may not be familiar with the items involved and may not be able to dispose of them in the most judicious way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will bring in complaints from the offerers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church should never engage in any selling on behalf of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We want the brothers to sell their own possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is special significance to this exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>An article that a person owns was bought by him with a price; he has been holding on to it for years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He has a special attachment for such an article.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He loves and enjoys it; it is at the seat of his affection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a crucial parting should be executed personally by the owner.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is like a man who has a son in his old age.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The son is particularly dear to him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Anything to do with the son has to be handled by his aged father personally.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The brothers and sisters should do the tearing down before the Lord with their own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They have labored for a long time to build up this love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now the Lord is asking them to tear it down with their own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God could have asked Abraham to entrust his son to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He could have asked him to give Isaac to Lot for adoption, or He could have sent an angel to Mount Moriah to do the killing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God, however, wanted Abraham to take up his own sword to do the killing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This would leave a lasting wound in Abraham, and out of such a wound life would flow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The same is true with the brothers and sisters when they sell their all; they have to kill their own Isaacs.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This will leave a wound in them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They have to make the cut themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this way blessing will flow out of their wound.</S>
