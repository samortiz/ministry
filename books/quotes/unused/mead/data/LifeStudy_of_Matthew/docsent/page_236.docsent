   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Parable for Watchfulness 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ten Virgins</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 25:1 says, Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word Then here means at that time, that is, at the time of the parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the parousia described in chapter twenty-four is taking place, many things will be happening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Virgins signify believers in the aspect of life 2 Cor 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Believers, who are the kingdom people, are like chaste virgins, bearing the Lord s testimony the lamp in the dark age and going out of the world to meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this they need not only the indwelling, but also the fullness of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We Christians firstly are virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being a virgin is not a matter of work, service, or activity, but a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, we are not only virgins, but chaste, pure virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Being a virgin is not a matter of what we do or are able to do; it is absolutely a matter of what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether we are male or female, we are virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although I am an old man, I conduct myself like a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I would never sell my status as a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even before the enemy, I am a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>a. Taking Their Lamps</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 1 says that the virgins took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lamps signify the spirit of the believers Prov 20:27 , which contains the Spirit of God as the oil Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The believers shine with the light of the Spirit of God from within their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, they become the light of the world, like a lamp shining in the darkness of this age Matt 5:14-16; Phil 2:15-16 to bear the testimony of the Lord for the glorification of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, as virgins we do not take weapons for fighting or sports equipment for playing, but lamps for testifying, shining, and enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In our hand is a lamp shining for the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Going Forth</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The virgins went forth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This signifies that the believers are going out of the world to meet the coming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The virgins do not linger or settle in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, they are going out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In one of his writings, D. M. Panton said that the world was just a pathway to him and at the end of this pathway there would be a grave.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Lord delays His coming back, the world eventually will afford me only a resting place, a tomb in which to lie as I wait for the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not settled in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are going out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To Meet the Bridegroom</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The bridegroom signifies Christ as the pleasant and attractive person John 3:29; Matt 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How good it is that in this parable the Lord likens Himself not to a victorious general or great commander-in-chief, but to a bridegroom, a most pleasant person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, we are the virgins going, and He is the Bridegroom coming.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Five Foolish Ones</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not Taking Oil with Them</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 2 says, And five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Five is composed of four plus one, signifying that man signified by four with God signified by one added to him bears responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fact that five are foolish and five prudent does not indicate that half the believers are foolish and the other half are prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It indicates that all believers bear responsibility to be filled with the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Old Testament reveals clearly that five is the number of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, the ten commandments were divided into two groups of five.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Also, the number five appears frequently with respect to the tabernacle and its furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Five is the basic factor of many of its dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The five fingers on our hand indicate how the number five is composed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is composed of four plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we have pointed out, the number four signifies the creature and the number one the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The creature plus the Creator gives the ability to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we had just four fingers without a thumb, it would be difficult for us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that by ourselves, as the number four, we cannot bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But when God is added to us, we are able to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 2 says that five of the virgins were foolish and five were prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord Jesus mentions the foolish first because in the bearing of responsibility the problem is not with the prudent ones, but with the foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Being foolish does not make these five virgins false.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In nature they are the same as the five prudent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 3 tells us the reason they were foolish: For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Oil signifies the Spirit of God Isa 61:1; Heb 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The foolish ones were foolish because they had oil only in the lamp, but not the extra portion of oil in the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In addition to the regenerating Spirit, they did not have the infilling Spirit, the extra portion of the Holy Spirit.</S>
