   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Do you realize that the Christ of Psalm 8 is incarnated as a man?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Without Hebrews 2, it would be difficult to discover the mentioning in Psalm 8 of Christ as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 2 discloses that the man mentioned in Psalm 8 is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God made Christ a little lower than the angels this was the incarnation, and this was the man by the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the incarnation, it says that this man was crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is His ascension, including His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ was crowned with glory and honor because He was resurrected and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the ascension here includes the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then it says that all things were put under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is His dominion over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now Christ has the dominion, the Lordship, the Headship, and the Kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And just this little word "feet" indicates His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 1:22 and 23 say that God "hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The two feet are parts of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we have the incarnation, the resurrection, the ascension, the enthronement, the Lordship, the Kingship, the Kingdom, and the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Body is just the many saints who will be brought into glory according to Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The day will come when He will be the Head in God's dominion, and we will be the Body under His Lordship and in His Kingdom to rule over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In that day, we will all shout, "O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today we must have foresight to see through to the end. We must not care for today's situation; we must set our eyes upon that day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sooner or later that day will come.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sooner or later all these pitiful situations will be past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Have you realized that in Psalms 3 through 7 there is a night prayer and a morning prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Psalm 3 is a prayer for the night, and Psalm 5 is a prayer for the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I am going to sleep, I may pray Psalm 3, and when I arise in the morning, I may pray Psalm 5.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we have really seen something of Psalms 2 and 8, we will have neither a night prayer nor a morning prayer; we will only have praise for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will say, "Look, there is a man in the glory!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was incarnated, He was made a little lower than the angels; He went to the cross and suffered death, He was resurrected and ascended to the heavens; He was enthroned and made the Head, the King, the Lord over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you still have some evening prayers and some morning prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are you so pious, so religious?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do you have a breakfast prayer, a lunch prayer and a dinner prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you have seen Christ, you can only say, "O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the morning, in the evening, at the breakfast table, lunch table, dinner table, any kind of table, you will say, "O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You will not have a marriage prayer, and you will not have a funeral prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In any kind of circumstance, you can only say, "I have seen Christ, I have seen God's economy in Christ; I do not care for anything but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Psalm 2 tells us that Christ is the center of God's administration in the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then Psalm 8 continues by telling us that this Christ is the incarnated and resurrected One, the One who has ascended to the heavens and is enthroned and crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has the Lordship, the Headship, the Kingship, and the dominion over all things with His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is a marvelous Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we have seen this Christ, we can do nothing but praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Psalms 3 through 7 the writers were occupied with the adversaries and their own problems; so they asked God to solve these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the answer is in Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is by Christ incarnated, identified with man, crowned with glory, and made, with His Body, to have dominion over all things, that the problem on earth can be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The solution includes the incarnation up to the time of the Kingdom; then when the Kingdom comes, Christ with His Body will have dominion over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At that time all earth's problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the content of Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why is the name of the Lord so excellent in all the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because Christ was incarnated to accomplish redemption, He was resurrected to impart life to His Body, He was crowned with glory, and He was enthroned and made to have dominion over all things with His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The day will come when Christ with His Body will exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no need for you to ask for this and that; just wait praisingly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the day praise for such a Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>During the past fifty years I have been closely observing world history.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There have been world wars and other wars.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The League of Nations has come and gone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The United Nations has been formed with the attempt to effect world peace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The human race has done its utmost to solve its problems, but the more problems they solve, the more they have.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The fact is that no one can solve the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You just wait praisingly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hallelujah, Christ will come back!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He has been made the Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>With His Body He will have the dominion over all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At that time, everything will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am waiting for that.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The older I get, the more I am expecting it and the closer I am to that time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Oh, let us all exclaim, "O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!"</S>
