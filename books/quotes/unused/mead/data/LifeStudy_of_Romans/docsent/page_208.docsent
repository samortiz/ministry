   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE THE DISPENSATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH HIS HOLINESS, AND UNTO HIS GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is very important that we get into the depths of the book of Romans and not read it in a superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall consider the matter of the dispensation of the Triune God according to His righteousness, through His holiness, and unto His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we have four important words: dispensation, righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we pointed out in the foregoing message, Paul does not use the word dispensation in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, the fact of God s dispensation is implied throughout this book. righteousness, holiness, and glory, on the contrary, are dealt with by Paul explicitly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s dispensation is according to His righteousness; that is, it is based upon His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, it is through His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that His dispensation is processed through holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Finally, this dispensation is unto God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It issues in the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>RIGHTEOUSNESS BEING THE BASE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>FOR GOD S DISPENSATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many verses in Romans speak of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1:17 Paul says that the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 3:21 he says that the righteousness of God has been manifested, and in 3:25 and 26 he speaks of the showing forth of the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 5:17 Paul refers to the gift of righteousness and in 5:21 of grace reigning through righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 8:10 he says that our spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These verses indicate that in the book of Romans righteousness is a footing, a standing, a base, for God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The dispensation of the Triune God into us is according to God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not according to the law nor according to virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is uniquely according to the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Psalm 89:14 says that righteousness and justice are the foundation of God s throne ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s throne is based upon His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without righteousness, even God s throne would have no footing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, righteousness is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The entire universe rests upon God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If suddenly there were no righteousness, the universe would collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, the Bible reveals that God s kingdom is built upon righteousness Heb 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Human government is also based on at least some measure of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, if there were no righteousness in this country, the government would fall.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same principle, if there were no righteousness in society or in our personal life, both society and our personal life would collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Righteousness is the supporting base upon which all things rest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The heavens, the earth, and everything in the universe are based upon God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In His economy the Triune God desires to dispense Himself into the three parts of man, into man s spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if God does not meet the requirements of His righteousness, He cannot carry out the dispensation of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His dispensation must be according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible reveals that there is a relationship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this relationship a number of transactions take place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These transactions must always be based upon righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, for God s dispensation, the first basic requirement is God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS,</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>HOLINESS, AND GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Three of the divine attributes righteousness, holiness, and glory place requirements upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Righteousness is versus sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I believe that we all are aware of the requirement of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we may not be aware of the demands of God s holiness and glory; we may have no realization that glory is one of God s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 3:23 Paul points out that we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that we have not fulfilled the requirement of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Genesis 3:24 indicates that as soon as man fell, he could not meet the requirements of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This verse says that God placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The sword signifies God s righteousness; the flame, God s holiness; and the cherubim, God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The sword kills, the fire consumes, and the cherubim observe.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because man had fallen and had become sinful, the way to the tree of life was barred by God s righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Praise the Lord that through Christ s redemption the requirements of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory have been fulfilled and the way to the tree of life has been opened once again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order for man to have a proper relationship with God, these three requirements had to be fulfilled.</S>
