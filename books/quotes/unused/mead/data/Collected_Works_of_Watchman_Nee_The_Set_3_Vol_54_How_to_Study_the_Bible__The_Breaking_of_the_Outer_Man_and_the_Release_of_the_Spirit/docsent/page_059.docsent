   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE IMPORTANCE OF BREAKING Scripture Reading: John 12:24; Heb 4:12-13; 1 Cor 2:11-14; 2 Cor 3:6; Rom 1:9; 7:6; 8:4-8; Gal 5:16, 22-23, 25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sooner or later a servant of God discovers that he himself is the greatest frustration to his work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sooner or later he finds that his outer man does not match his inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The inner man heads in one direction, while the outer man heads in another direction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He discovers that his outer man cannot be subject to the rule of the spirit and cannot walk according to God's highest demands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He discovers that the greatest hindrance to his work is his outer man and that this outer man frustrates him from exercising his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every servant of God should be able to exercise his spirit, to secure God's presence in his spirit, to know God's word through his spirit, to touch men's condition by his spirit, to convey God's word through his spirit, and to sense and receive divine revelation with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet the frustration of the outer man makes it impossible for him to use his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many servants of the Lord are fundamentally unfit for the Lord's work because they have never been dealt with by the Lord in a fundamental way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without this dealing, they are basically unqualified for any work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All excitement, zeal, and earnest pleading is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of fundamental dealing is the only way for us to become a useful vessel to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE OUTER MAN AND THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 7:22 says, "For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our inner man delights in the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 3:16 also tells us "to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 2 Corinthians 4:16 Paul also said, "Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible divides our being into the outer man and the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God resides in the inner man, and the man outside this God-occupied inner man is the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, our spirit is the inner man, while the person that others contact is the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our inner man puts on our outer man like a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has placed Himself, His Spirit, His life, and His power in us, that is, in our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Outside of our inner man is our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Outside of all these is our body, our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order for a man to work for God, his inner man must be released.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fundamental problem with many servants of God is that their inner man cannot break out of their outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order for the inner man to be released, it must break out of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to be clear that the first obstacle to our work is ourselves, not other things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our inner man is an imprisoned, confined man, our spirit is shrouded and not easily released.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we have never learned to break through our outer man with our spirit, we cannot work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nothing frustrates us like the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether or not our work will be effective depends on whether the Lord has broken down our outer man and whether the inner man can be released through our broken, outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a very fundamental issue.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord has to dismantle our outer man in order to make way for our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As soon as the inner man is released, many sinners will be blessed and many Christians will receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>DEATH AND THE BEARING OF FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Life is in the grain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, there is a shell outside of the grain, a very powerful shell.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as this shell does not break open, the grain cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is this death?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is the action of the temperature and moisture of the earth upon the grain which results in the breaking of the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the shell breaks, the grain grows.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, it is not a matter of whether or not the grain has life, but whether the outer shell is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The very next verse says, "He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life" v. 25 . According to the Lord the outer shell is our own life, and the inner life is the eternal life that He dispenses.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order for the inner life to be released, the outer life must suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If that which is outward is not broken, that which is inward cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Among all the people in the world, some have the Lord's life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Among those who have the Lord's life, we find two different kinds of conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With the first, the life is bound, surrounded, and locked up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With the second, the Lord has opened up a way and the life can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The problem with us today is not how we can have life, but how we can allow this life to flow out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we say that the Lord has to break us, this is not a figure of speech or a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our very being has to be broken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord's life is well able to spread over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, it is locked up within us!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord is well able to bless the church, yet His life is imprisoned, contained, and blocked in us!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the outer man is not broken, we can never become a blessing to the church, nor can we expect the world to receive God's grace through us!</S>
