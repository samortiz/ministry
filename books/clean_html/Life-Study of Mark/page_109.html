<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING LIGHT FROM THE LORD</h2><p>We should not think that to understand the Bible it is sufficient to know the original languages of the Bible, Hebrew and Greek. The ancient scribes knew the Old Testament in Hebrew. But although they had the knowledge of the language, they did not have any light. The Lord Jesus, on the contrary, had the divine light. For this reason, He was able to point out how the matter of resurrection is implied in the title of God as the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. Without divine light, no one would be able to see that this divine title involves resurrection.</p><p>I encourage the saints to learn Hebrew and Greek. But you may have a doctoral degree in Hebrew or Greek and still be blind. You need light from God. In order to receive light, you should not trust in your knowledge of biblical languages or in the expositions of the great teachers, but you need to kneel down before the Lord and open to Him. You may need to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, although I know Hebrew and Greek, without You I cannot see any light. Lord, I need Your enlightenment. Light does not come from my study or analysis. Light comes, Lord, through Your mercy. O Lord, how I need to receive light from You.&rdquo;</p><p>If we do not receive light from the Lord, we may read the Gospel of Mark again and again without seeing anything. We need the visions contained in this book to be &ldquo;telecast&rdquo; into our being. I can testify that, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I have seen the visions in this book. Sometimes the light comes while I am speaking. For example, it was during the course of one of the messages that I saw the comparison of the six days for the old creation with the six days of preparation for the new creation. Such light does not come from knowing the biblical languages or the writings of expositors. It comes from the Lord through His mercy as we open ourselves to Him.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONED BY A SCRIBE</h2><p>In 12:28-34 the Slave-Savior was questioned by a scribe. In Matthew 22:35 this one is called a lawyer. &ldquo;Scribe&rdquo; is a wider term that includes the lawyers, who were Mosaic jurists. The lawyers were versed in the law of Moses; they were professional interpreters of the law of the Old Testament.</p><p>This scribe, who knew the law in a thorough way, boldly came to the Lord Jesus. Knowing that He had answered well those who were disputing with Him, the scribe asked the Lord, &ldquo;Which is the first commandment of all?&rdquo; (v. 28). The Lord answered, &ldquo;The first is, Hear, Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord; and you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart, and from your whole soul, and from your whole mind, and from your whole strength&rdquo; (vv. 29-30). To love the Lord in this way is to love Him with every part of our being, with our spirit, soul, and body.</p><p>In verse 31 the Lord continued His answer: &ldquo;The second is this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.&rdquo;</p><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR="#1f1a17" SIZE="2" FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">These two commandments are both a matter of love, either loving God or loving man. Love is the spirit of God&rsquo;s commandments. The greatest commandments, therefore, are altogether a matter of love, a love toward God and toward man.</FONT></P><h2 class="head1">THE IMPRESSION MADE ON THE LORD&rsquo;S FOLLOWERS</h2><p>Verse 34 ends like this: &ldquo;And no one dared to question Him anymore.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus answered all the questions and gained a full victory. No doubt, Peter, John, James, and all the other close followers of the Lord Jesus saw these confrontations and were impressed with the way the Lord handled them. Do you not believe that they were deeply impressed with how the Lord answered the questions raised by the opposers, with how He passed through an insidious test and examination? Certainly, the Lord&rsquo;s followers must have been very impressed with Him.</p>
