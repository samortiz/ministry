   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY The Father s Rich Mercy and Great Love</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because God loved His chosen people with a noble, high, and great love, He would not give them up.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Within His love there are the riches of His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Love may maintain a high standard, but there is no need of any standard for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mercy can reach you in any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Love does not reach as far as mercy does.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You do not love a pitiful person; you love a person who matches you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But within your love there may be mercy that reaches farther to people s pitiful condition to bring love to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God, in His great love, came to make us alive 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Have you noticed that Ephesians 2 is different from the first section of Romans?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the first section of Romans it was sin and sins which were taken care of in order that we could be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But death is taken care of in Ephesians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Ephesians 2 we were not merely sinners we were dead people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Dead people need more than justification; they need to be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, in His great love, God first enlivened us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When He resurrected Christ from the dead, He enlivened us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not enliven you at one time and me at another time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He enlivened us all at the same time in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Greek language the predicate used in 2:5 for enlivened or made alive has the prefix sun.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This prefix means together, with, or co. God enlivened us together.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This includes the apostles and all of us, even the last one to be saved in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of us were enlivened together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just as the children of Israel passed through the Red Sea together, so God enlivened all of us together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God also raised us up from among the dead v. 6 . Furthermore, He exalted us and seated us in the heavenlies v. 6 . This is the salvation revealed in Ephesians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This salvation is not a salvation merely of forgiveness of sins or hope of going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not need to wait for a future day to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have already been seated in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is neither a salvation merely of justification or reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a salvation of being enlivened, being raised up from the dead, and being seated in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is to be saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What a wonderful threefold salvation we have!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In our salvation God has made us alive, He has raised us up together, and He has seated us with Christ in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the salvation revealed in Ephesians, salvation by life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A dead person can be made alive only by the dispensing of life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Forgiveness alone cannot make a dead person alive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Neither can washing cause a dead person to be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A person who is dead needs life-dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once life is dispensed into a dead person, he can jump up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He may still be dirty, but he can stand and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is life-dispensing that enlivens him and raises him from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be saved by grace is much higher than to receive forgiveness of sins or justification or reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is salvation that imparts life to us to make us alive, that raises us up from the dead, and that exalts us to the heavens and seats us there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is no wonder that Ephesians 2:10 indicates that such a salvation produces God s masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 10 says that we are God s workmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek word for workmanship may also be translated masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Greek word here is poiema, a word that has been anglicized into the English word poem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are God s poem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A poem often displays the wisdom of the writer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It expresses his skill, art, and design.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are poems written by the threefold life-dispensing of the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This threefold life-dispensing makes us a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are the masterpiece of our Triune God by His threefold life-dispensing.</S>
