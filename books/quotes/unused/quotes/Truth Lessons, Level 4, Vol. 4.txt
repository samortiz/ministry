The first aspect of the believers' future is in the completing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of glorification
They claim that the glorification of the believers will take place instantaneously at the coming of the Lord Jesus
Our glorification will actually be the consummation of a process of gradual growth and development in the divine life
Glorification is the issue of transformation, and transformation is accomplished through the gradual and continuous growth in life
Christ, the hope of glory , has been sown into us as the seed of glory, and this seed will grow until it reaches the stage of blossoming
For God to glorify us means that He causes the glory that has been sown into us to saturate our entire being and to be expressed through us
When our entire being has been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, that glory will come out of us
Through regeneration Christ as the glory came into us, and now we have the seed of glory in us as our hope of glory
When Christ returns to glorify us, this glory will come out of us and will be manifested to the fullest extent
In Colossians 3:4 Paul says that when Christ our life is manifested, then we also will be manifested with Him in glory
At that time, God's glory will not only have spread from our spirit into our soul but will also be expressed through our body
The three parts of our being-spirit, soul, body-will be the same as Christ is and will be fully saturated with God's glory
Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the bountiful life supply to us
2 Thessalonians 2:14 says that God has called us through the gospel so that we may obtain the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ
God has called us to obtain this glory, the glory of the divine life and the divine nature to express the Divine Being
According to Romans 8:21, when the believers are glorified, they will enjoy the glory of the children of God with its freedom
All creation, which has been subjected to vanity, is groaning, and it is travailing together in pain until now
Although creation will not share in our glory, it will enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God
We will be glorified in the divine life and the divine nature to bear the glory of the Triune God for His expression
The first aspect of the believers' future is in the completing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of glorification
In the completing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of glorification, the believers will first be glorified
When Christ comes again and is manifested, the indwelling Christ will saturate our entire being, including our physical body
No matter how mature we may become in the divine life, as long as we have not been glorified, we have not been redeemed in our body
Corinthians 1:30 says that Christ has become 'wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
He is sanctification by which we are being sanctified in our soul that is transformed in our mind emotion and will with His divine life
The firstfruits of the Spirit are simply the Spirit as the firstfruits of the coming harvest of what God is to us
The firstfruits are the Holy Spirit as a sampling of the full taste of God, that is, as the foretaste of the full blessing to come
The issue of our enjoyment of the Spirit as the firstfruits is the redemption of our body, which is the full sonship
Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit 'is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession'
In God's New Testament economy, the processed Triune God has become our inheritance, and we have become God's possession
Our experience of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is our enjoyment of God as our inheritance in a practical way
As we enjoy God as our inheritance, His element comes into our being and transforms us to make us His inheritance for His enjoyment
The Holy Spirit within us is not only a foretaste but also a pledge, guaranteeing that God is ours and that we will be His
The Triune God has put His Spirit into us as a pledge, guaranteeing that He will be our inheritance unto the redemption of our body
The word unto indicates that our being sealed continually with the Holy Spirit results in, or issues in, the redemption of our body
Christ's resurrected body, the body of Christ's glory, is saturated with God's glory and transcendent over corruption and death
Our body may be enlivened by the Spirit who indwells us , but it is still a mortal body subject to death and needing to be redeemed
No matter how much our body may be enlivened and even saturated by the Spirit, it still requires the Lord's full redemption
To transfigure our body of humiliation is a difficult matter and needs the operation of the One who is able to subject all things to Himself
The time is coming when the last enemy, death, will not only be destroyed but also swallowed up by resurrection life
When death in our entire being is swallowed up by Christ's resurrection life, 'this corruptible will put on incorruption'
Life is the divine element, even God Himself, imparted into our spirit; incorruption is the consequence of life saturating our body
When, by being saturated with life, our body is transfigured at the time of the Lord's coming, our body will become incorruptible
When the death in our entire being is swallowed up by the resurrection life, 'this mortal will put on immortality'
When we are transfigured and clothed with the heavenly, spiritual, and resurrected body, then what is mortal will be swallowed up by life
In the completing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of glorification, the believers will experience the redemption of their body
We have sonship in our spirit through regeneration, and we may also have sonship in our soul through transformation
The time is coming when the last enemy, death, will not only be destroyed but also swallowed up by resurrection life
These three and a half years will be the second half of the last week of the seventy weeks revealed in Daniel 9
Those in the partial rapture school say that the overcomers will be raptured earlier than the majority of the believers
The teachers in this last school have accurately seen the details concerning the Lord's coming back and the believers' rapture
The Bible presents two main aspects of the rapture: the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers
Leviticus 23:10 presents a type related to the two aspects of the believers' rapture-the type of crops ripening in the field
The first of the crop to ripen is the firstfruits, the overcoming believers, who will be brought directly to God's temple in the heavens
Later, after the rest of the crop has ripened, the majority of the believers will be harvested and taken to the air
Beginning with Abel who was the first martyr all the martyred overcomers throughout the generations are waiting for the time of resurrection
The manchild will be raptured before the last three and a half years twelve hundred sixty days which is the period of the great tribulation
One hundred and forty-four thousand in verse 1 is an actual number but with a symbolic meaning: it has a spiritual significance
One hundred and forty-four is twelve times twelve, which signifies the completion of completions, the ultimate completion in the fullest way
The one hundred and forty-four thousand firstfruits signify the believers who accomplish God's eternal purpose
The one hundred and forty-four thousand living overcomers will be raptured for the fresh enjoyment of God and Christ
The enemy, the devil, must be cast down from heaven by the man-child, who will execute God's judgment over the enemy
There is another need in the heavens-God and Christ must have the firstfruits in order to obtain fresh enjoyment and satisfaction
The one hundred and forty-four thousand living overcomers will be raptured to Mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation
The majority of the believers, signified by the harvest , will be raptured toward the end of the great tribulation
The rapture of the overcomers will also include the rest of the overcoming believers who will be living at the Lord's coming back
The rapture of the overcoming believers will occur secretly, even unexpectedly, and it will be in different places and at different times
At the time of the rapture of the living overcomers, Christ will not yet have left heaven to come down to the air
The minority of those who are taken, the living overcomers, will stand before the Savior on Mount Zion in the heavens
The Lord promises that if we are watchful and beseeching at every time we will prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen
If we are able to escape or are counted worthy to escape the coming tribulation, we will be raptured to, placed in, His presence
To be kept out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, is to be kept out of the great tribulation
There are two main aspects of the rapture: the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers
Leviticus 23:10 presents a type related to the two aspects of the believers' rapture; it is a type of crops ripening in the field
The enemy, the devil, must be cast down from heaven by the man-child, who will execute God's judgment over him
There is another need in the heavens-God and Christ must have the firstfruits in order to obtain fresh enjoyment and satisfaction
The rapture of the overcomers will also include the rest of the overcoming believers who will be living at the Lord's coming back
Those who are mature in life will be raptured before the great tribulation; those who are immature will be left in the great tribulation
The Lord promises that if we are watchful and beseeching at every time, we will prevail to escape all the things of the great tribulation
In this lesson we will continue from the previous lesson to consider other aspects of the rapture of the believers
When the Lord Jesus returns, the believers will be of two classes, signified by the numbers two in Matthew 24 and ten in Matthew 25
Because the two men and two women are working , they represent the believers who will be alive when the Lord returns
The ten virgins, on the contrary, were asleep , indicating that the majority of the believers will have died by the time the Lord returns
The believers are like pure virgins, bearing the Lord's testimony in the dark age and going out of the world to meet the Lord
Five virgins being foolish and five being prudent does not indicate that half the believers are foolish and the other half are prudent
The virgins who were ready were invited to go in with the bridegroom to the wedding feast, and the door was shut
The foolish virgins were foolish because they had oil only in their lamps but not an extra portion of oil in their vessels
In addition to the regenerating Spirit, they did not have the infilling Spirit, the extra portion of the Holy Spirit
If we do not pay the price today we must pay it after our resurrection because others cannot obtain the infilling of the Holy Spirit for us
Eventually, after their resurrection the foolish virgins must pay the price to buy the oil to fill their vessels
The foolish virgins who do not take oil in their vessels and are not ready when the Lord Jesus comes will miss the wedding feast of the Lamb
The dead believers, signified by the ten virgins, will be the first to rise up and be raptured into the Lord's parousia
When the Lord Jesus comes back, all the dead believers will be resurrected and will be taken along with the living believers to the air
The resurrection of the righteous is the resurrection of life; it is the time when God will reward the saints at the Lord's return
We should not be content merely to be in the general resurrection; rather, we should aspire to be in the first, the best, resurrection
The outresurrection from the dead denotes the outstanding resurrection the extraresurrection which will be a prize to the overcoming saints
The rapture of the overcomers will take place before the last three and a half years, a period known as the great tribulation
Those who are alive and remain will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation, that is, at the last trumpet
Verse 17 also says that those believers who are alive and remain unto the Lord's coming will be caught up 'to meet the Lord in the air'
They will enjoy the Lord's presence much more than what they enjoyed of His presence in their spirit while they lived on earth
When the Lord Jesus returns, the majority of the believers who have died through all the generations will rise up from the dead
The prudent ones are ready and will be invited to go in with the Bridegroom to the wedding feast, the marriage dinner of the Lamb
Those who are Christ's, that is, the believers in Christ, will be resurrected unto life at the Lord's coming back before the millennium
In addition, when the Lord comes back to reward the saints, the overcoming believers will receive the resurrection of the righteous
It is the resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers so that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom
Those who are alive and remain will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation, that is, at the last trumpet
After being raptured to meet the Lord in the air, they will be always with the Lord to enjoy His presence by seeing Him face to face
They will enjoy the Lord's presence much more than what they enjoyed of His presence in their spirit while they lived on earth
Some believers think that there is only one kind of judgment in the New Testament-to decide whether people will perish or be saved
The judgment at the judgment seat of God or the judgment seat of Christ will be before the millennium immediately after Christs coming back
It will be to judge all the resurrected and raptured believers, and it will be for reward or punishment in the millennial kingdom
When the Lord Jesus, together with His overcomers, defeats Antichrist and his army, many Gentiles will still be living on earth
When the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory
Those who are regarded as goats will go with their leader, Antichrist, 'into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels'
Finally, the New Testament reveals that the dead unbelievers will be judged by Christ at the great white throne after the millennium
Just as Noah and his family were judged by the flood but were inside the ark, so we have been judged by God on the cross in Christ
He exercises His family judgment in His house according to His will to correct us so that we may grow and experience more transformation
Eventually, at the Lord's coming back, He will judge us to decide whether we will receive a reward or punishment in the coming age
The believers will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ in order to be recompensed for the things that they have done
At the judgment seat of Christ, each believer will give an account of himself to God in order for the Lord to settle accounts with him
Matthew 25:19 speaks of this: 'After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them'
A long time signifies the entire church age, and came signifies the Lord's descending to the air in His coming
If our heart is right, good, pure, and for God, then at the judgment seat of Christ we will be rewarded with praise from God
The punishment that the Lord will measure to them is related to a certain dispensational punishment, not to eternal perdition
God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will surely be attained at the end of this age
The marriage of the Lamb will come after the rapture of the majority of the believers and also after the judgment of the believers
The righteousness we received for our salvation is objective and enables us to meet the requirement of the righteous God
The fine linen with which the overcoming believers are clothed is equal to the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11-12
According to the revelation of the Scriptures, the believers need two garments-one for their salvation and one for their reward
We also need the second garment, which is the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11-12 and the fine linen in Revelation 19:8
The first garment qualifies us to meet God for our salvation; the second garment qualifies us to meet Christ for our reward
Only the overcomers will be called to the marriage dinner as a reward to them; not all the saved ones will participate in it
After being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity
The overcoming believers, those who will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb, will also be the bride of the Lamb
God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through the redemption of Christ and the divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will surely be attained at the end of this age
The overcoming believers, those who have made themselves ready, will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb and will be His bride
The fine linen indicates our overcoming life, our overcoming living, which is the Christ whom we live out of our being
The fine linen with which the overcoming believers are clothed is equal to the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11-12
According to the revelation of the Scriptures, the believers need two garments-one for salvation and one for reward
We also need the second garment, which is the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11-12 and the fine linen in Revelation 19:8, for our reward
If we do not have this second garment-the fine linen, bright and clean-we will miss the marriage dinner of the Lamb
When Christ fights against Antichrist, He fights as the Word of God, and His fighting will be a powerful speaking
The fact that this name will be written on Christ's garment and His thigh indicates that it will be openly revealed and known to all
To be called is to be saved, but to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life
Although we have the assurance that we have been called, we do not yet have the assurance that we have been chosen
The heavenly armies following the Lord will fight against Antichrist and the false prophet and their armies and will destroy them
The beast and the kings of the earth and their armies will gather together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army
Antichrist and the false prophet with their armies will form the strongest force against God, fighting directly with God
The unclean spirits who stir up this rebellion should be in the heavenlies, but having become frogs, they can move about only on the earth
As revealed in Zechariah 13 and 14, in the great tribulation Antichrist and his armies will slaughter two-thirds of the people of Israel
Christ and His chosen overcomers will defeat and destroy them all at Armageddon and will save the nation of Israel
In the completing stage of God's full salvation, the overcoming believers will be the heavenly armies following Christ
The heavenly armies following Christ are His called, chosen, and faithful ones and His bride called to His marriage dinner
To be called is to be saved, but to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life
We all have been called, but in order to be among the chosen in the future, we need to live an overcoming life today
The armies consist of those who are both the bride and the guests called, invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb
The beast and the false prophet will be seized, and they will be cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone
After Christ and His heavenly armies fight against Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies, the kingdom will be brought in
The earthly part will be the kingdom of the Messiah the tabernacle of David the restored kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of the Son of Man
In the millennium the overcoming believers will be in the heavenly part of the kingdom and will reign with Christ over the earthly part
Because of this, today the believers shine as lamps , but in the coming age the overcomers will shine as the sun
To inherit the kingdom is not just to enter into the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment
The coming kingdom will be a joyful inheritance to the overcomers as their reward and as their enjoyment with the Lord
In Luke 12:32 the Lord Jesus said, 'Do not be afraid, little flock, because your Father has been well pleased to give you the kingdom'
The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God , and they are in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today
The millennium will be a kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today
The promise of inheriting the kingdom should be an incentive for all believers to live an overcoming life on earth today
Paul warned the believers in Galatia that those who practice the works of the flesh 'will not inherit the kingdom of God'
The crown of life, as a prize to the overcomers, denotes the overcoming strength that is the power of the resurrection life
It also signifies that the overcomers have attained to the out-resurrection from the dead, that is, the outstanding resurrection
The believers' participation in the coming kingdom also includes their being rewarded to have their names remain in the book of life
That a name is erased out of the book of life indicates that that name has already been written in the book of life
The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings that God has prepared for them
The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book
The blessings that God has prepared for His chosen ones are in three stages: the church, the millennial kingdom, and eternity
All God's chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life
In Matthew 10:39 the Lord Jesus said, 'He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
In Luke 924 the Lord said Whoever wants to save his soullife shall lose it but whoever loses his soullife for My sake this one shall save it
Many believers are loose or indifferent in following the Lord and only want things such as greatness and prosperity
These verses indicate that in the coming manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ as His co-kings
The Lord promised the overcoming believers that they will rule over the nations in the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens
Finally, in the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will be appointed by the Lord to rule over all the possessions of the Lord
After Christ and His heavenly armies fight against Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies, the kingdom will be brought in
In the heavenly part of the millennium the Lord will drink the cup of the new covenant new with the overcoming believers
To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded with the crown of life and to eat of the tree life in the Paradise of God
They will exercise the authority of Christ to rule over the nations they will also be appointed by the Lord to rule over all His possessions
In eternity the believers will participate in this ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
Christ's death as the grain of wheat terminated the old creation and released the divine life to germinate the new creation
Revelation 21:27 says that only 'those who are written in the Lamb's book of life' will enter into the New Jerusalem
After his creation, man was put before the tree of life , indicating that man was privileged to partake of the tree of life
We have been redeemed so that we may have the right to come to the tree of life, which is Christ with all the riches of the divine life
Revelation 21:12 says that the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel are inscribed on the gates of the New Jerusalem
After all Gods redeemed saints have been raptured to the heavens they will be the New Jerusalem which will come down out of heaven from God
As the wife of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ to be His spouse, just as Eve came out of Adam and became his counterpart
Men in Revelation 21:3 refers not to the believers but to the nations , the people living on the new earth outside the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is not only the mutual habitation of God and the believers, but also God's tabernacle among the nations as His expression
Speaking of Abraham, Hebrews 11:10 says, 'He eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God'
To say that the New Jerusalem is a physical city depreciates God's wisdom and belittles Him as the eternal, wise Architect
God is a wise Designer and Artificer who designs such a city to be a full manifestation of His multifarious wisdom
In His wisdom God constructs the New Jerusalem by dispensing Himself as the Architect and Builder into our being
The believers as sons of God will dwell in the New Jerusalem participate in all its enjoyment serve God and the Lamb and reign for eternity
The New Jerusalem is not a physical city but a corporate person the aggregate of Gods redeemed regenerated transformed and glorified people
After all Gods redeemed saints have been raptured to the heavens they will be the New Jerusalem which will come down out of heaven from God
The holy city, New Jerusalem, will also be God's tabernacle, God's eternal dwelling place among men for His rest
They will dwell in the New Jerusalem, participate in all its enjoyment, serve God and the Lamb, and reign for eternity
In this lesson we will consider further aspects of the believers future in the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
Revelation 22:1 speaks of 'the throne of God and of the Lamb,' showing that there is one throne for God and the Lamb
God is the One who had a purpose, who made a plan in eternity past, and who created all things for the fulfillment of His plan
The throne of God and of the Lamb indicates that this throne is for the carrying out of God's plan through Christ's redemption
The throne for the accomplishment of God's purpose flows out the Triune God so that by this flow of life His purpose may be accomplished
The believers will enjoy the redeeming God as the temple of the holy city for their eternal dwelling with God as His serving ones
The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle for Gods dwelling place and within this tabernacle is God Himself as the temple to be our dwelling place
Revelation 21:22 says that the apostle John saw no temple in the New Jerusalem, for the temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb
Since God and the Lamb are the temple, They are the dwelling place of the believers, who serve the Triune God by dwelling in Him
In eternity future the believers will enjoy God who is the light of life in the lamp shining through the holy city
The Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light
Since such a divine light will illumine the holy city, it will have no need of any other light, whether created by God or made by man
The glory of God, with God as the substance, essence, and element, will be the light of the New Jerusalem shining in the Lamb as the lamp
For eternity we will enjoy the redeeming God-God in the Lamb shining as the light of life-in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
In eternity future the believers will enjoy the redeeming God as the spring of the water of life in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
The water flows out of this spring to saturate the believers, and this saturation, which involves God's dispensing, is our eternal portion
In eternity future the believers will enjoy Christ as the tree of life for their life supply in the New Jerusalem
Verse 2 says, 'On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month'
The tree of life grows on the two sides of the river of water of life and produces twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month
For eternity in the New Jerusalem the believers will reign as kings over the nations, the people around the New Jerusalem, forever and ever
These people, the nations, will simply be the natural man created by God and restored to the natural condition of God's creation
The believers are people belonging to God; they are God's sons born of Him; they are regenerated of God with His life and nature
In eternity the tree of life will have two functions, because there will be both the believers and the nations
The first function is related to the fruit of the tree of life, and the second function is related to its leaves
In eternity, in the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, all the believers will express God with His glory
The nations will walk in the light of the city; that is, they will walk in the light of the believers' shining
In the New Testament age we as believers are the light of the world , and the worldly people should walk in our light
In eternity all the redeemed people of God will be a great light shining over the nations, and the nations will walk in this light
It is a multiplication-the Triune God, who is signified by the number three, multiplied by man, who is signified by the number four
It is by the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity that the believers can have such a glorious future
The Lamb-God is on the throne as the center of the holy city for the administration of the eternal kingdom of God
The throne of God and of the Lamb indicates that this throne is for the carrying out of God's plan and Christ's redemption
The God whom we enjoy in eternity future will also be the light of life in the lamp shining through the holy city
Because such a divine light will illumine the holy city the city will have no need of any other light whether created by God or made by man
For eternity we will enjoy the redeeming God-God in the Lamb shining as the light of life-in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
The believers will also enjoy the redeeming God as the spring of the water of life in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
In the New Jerusalem the believers will be in glory, full of honor, reigning as kings over the nations for eternity
It is by the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity that the believers have such a glorious future
