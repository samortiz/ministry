   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INAUGURATION WITH AUTHORITY BY THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST The Need for Authority, Equipping, and Qualification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The resurrection life imparted into us is the inward aspect of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is also the need of something outward for authority, equipping, and qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All things in nature are types and signs of the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our physical life, for example, is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we may have a strong physical life, it is only for us to live.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our physical life is not the qualification, equipping, or authority to exercise an office.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to carry out an office, we must be qualified, equipped, and authorized.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though a person is living and healthy, he cannot go into the street and act as a policeman without the proper authorization.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He must do something further to be qualified before he can act as a policeman with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The resurrection of Christ enables us to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It imparts Christ Himself into us as our life and nature, but His resurrection is not sufficient to equip us, qualify us, and authorize us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we also need His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whereas resurrection is a matter of life, Christ's ascension is a matter of position, and position is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do not have the position, we can never have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can compare our position to the presidency.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the United States the president must be inaugurated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he is inaugurated into office, he is put into a position that authorizes, equips, and qualifies him to act and exercise the power of the presidency.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By raising up Christ from the dead, God testified that Christ is life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Death can neither subdue nor hold this life Acts 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This life is an indestructible life which can never be destroyed or damaged by anything Heb 7:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was proved and testified by Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By Christ's ascension, however, God testified that Christ is the Lord, the Head, and the King Acts 2:36; Eph 1:22; Rev 19:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In reference to this, Psalm 2:6 says, "But I have installed My King /Upon Zion, My holy mountain."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the Head, the Lord, and the King of kings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the anointed One, all power and authority have been committed and entrusted to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the very center of God's authority, power, administration, and government, and now He is on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was accomplished in Christ's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, resurrection is a matter of life, while ascension is a matter of headship, lordship, kingship, authority, government, enthronement, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the evening of the day of resurrection, the Lord came to the disciples in a very mysterious way; that is, He came to them as life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He came not openly but privately to the room where the disciples were meeting in a hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>None of the Lord's followers knew what was about to happen, but in a very secret and mysterious way He came to breathe Himself into them, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From that moment on, the disciples had this wonderful One within them as their life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, although these disciples were enlivened, regenerated, and raised up with Christ, they were still not qualified, equipped, and authorized because Christ Himself had not yet been enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not until He ascended into heaven was He enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 1:20-22 tells us that God raised Christ up and seated Him in the highest place as the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was enthroned and entrusted with all authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Resurrection, therefore, is a matter of life, while ascension is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Inauguration of the Body by the Anointing upon the Body</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today Christ is the Head and the center of all authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After His ascension, He descended as the Spirit of power to inaugurate His disciples on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the Old Testament, whenever apprentices assumed the priesthood, they needed to be anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This anointing was equivalent to their inauguration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the same way, Christ inaugurated the disciples on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That day was their inauguration day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time they were authorized, equipped, qualified, and placed into the position of power, and on that very day they began to assume their function.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the real meaning of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The baptism in the Holy Spirit is the inauguration, the anointing, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, the baptism in the Holy Spirit is not for individual believers but for the Body 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Head has inaugurated the Body, not the individual members separately.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, He has appointed and authorized the Body to function.</S>
