   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEAVING THE DENOMINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During the latter half of 1922, I uncovered another problem from the Bible the problem of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do the Scriptures say that I should be a member of the Methodist Church?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Corinthians 1 Paul exhorted the Corinthian believers not to be divisive by saying, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I began to consider: Was Wesley greater than Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If Paul rebuked the Corinthian believers for saying, "I am of Christ," surely for you to say that you are of the Presbyterian Church, while I am of the Methodist Church, and he is of the Baptist Church, is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At this time I was studying in a mission school.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The school sent me as a delegate to a spring retreat and required on the application form that I state in what denomination I held membership.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I wrote, "I am a Christian and I belong directly to Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They said, "Nevertheless, you are still a member of a denomination."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I replied, "No, I am simply a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible does not say that I should be a member of any denomination."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time I was determined not to confess with my mouth that I belonged to the Methodist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever I was asked concerning this matter, I always replied, "I am a Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day while reading the Bible I was pondering this problem: Could I simply leave the denomination?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Shortly after this I heard someone say that a certain department store went bankrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The conversation went like this: Whenever several people go into a business partnership, regardless of whether or not they are personally involved in the business of the store, once the business goes bankrupt, none can escape the consequences; everyone must share the responsibility of the bankruptcy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I realized from this conversation that as a member of the Methodist Church I was in a sort of partnership.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although in reality I did not take part in the system of the Methodist Church, in name I could not escape the consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I wished to follow the Lord, not only must I refrain from being a member of the Methodist Church in deeds, but also I must have my name removed from the Methodist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Having become clear concerning this matter, I felt it necessary to discuss it with my mother, since originally it was she who placed my name there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My mother did not immediately approve of my intention, for she feared that the Western missionaries who were considered our good friends would be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My feeling was that we should not be afraid of people being offended by us; rather, we should be afraid of the One who is greater than men being offended by us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day I went by boat to Mawei to see Margaret Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I asked how she felt about my name being in the Methodist Church's book of life what they called the church register .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She replied, "I am afraid that among the names in that book of life many are dead and not a few are perishing."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I said, "Should I have my name in a book of life on earth?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She replied, "If your name is recorded in the book of life in heaven, what good will an earthly book of life do you?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And if your name is not recorded in the heavenly book of life, what will this earthly book of life profit you?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I spoke to my mother persistently for two months regarding this matter, but still she would not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day while my whole family was in the garden, I took the opportunity to speak to my parents.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I said, "Is it scriptural to leave our name in the denomination?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They answered, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Again I said, "Is it our duty to obey the Bible?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Yes," they replied.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then I pressed on, saying, "Then why do we delay and not obey the Scriptures?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They replied, "Very well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do it; do it."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Immediately, I drafted a letter, and my father personally wrote out the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After each of us signed it, I dispatched it by registered mail.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In essence, the letter said this: "We have seen that sects are unscriptural and that denominationalism is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, from this day on please remove our names from your book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are doing this not because of any personal animosity, but simply because we wish to obey the teaching of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our decision is final, and it will not be necessary to bring it up again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We still consider ourselves your friends.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Besides our desire to obey the Bible, there is no other reason for our action."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Four days after the letter was mailed, several Western missionaries came to our home.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They said, "One only hears of a church excommunicating its members, never of a member excommunicating himself from a church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is the reason for your action?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We answered, "We have already explained our reason, and there is no need to discuss it further."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The following day they asked the principal of a certain school to come speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We said, "We have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are still your friends, but we wish our names to be removed from the record."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Later, our pastor, the district superintendent, and the bishop all came asking whether we had taken this action because of baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They explained that if members of the Methodist Church wished to be baptized by immersion, there was no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We replied, "The Lord led us to do what we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You feel there is no need to be legal, but we feel we must obey the Lord at all cost."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not a question of arguing with others about baptism by immersion or about leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The only question is whether or not men are willing to obey the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To be baptized by immersion and to leave the denominations are not great things; they are but two items among thousands that require our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The main thing in the Scriptures is obedience.</S>
