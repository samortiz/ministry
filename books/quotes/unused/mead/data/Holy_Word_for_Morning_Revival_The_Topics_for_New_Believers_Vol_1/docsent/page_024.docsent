   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 4 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Luke 19:8 And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rom 8:6 The mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Restoring What We Owe</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A third example of the clearance of the past is seen in the case of Zaccheus, in his restoring of what he owed others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As soon as he was saved, Zaccheus said to the Lord that if he had taken anything from anyone by false accusation, he would restore four times as much Luke 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To restore four times as much is neither a law nor a principle, but an issue of the dynamic salvation of the Lord, the moving of the Holy Spirit, and the inner urging of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>86 Due to this act of restoration, Zaccheus had a testimony before man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the basis of his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>87 This sets a good example, disclosing to us the way to deal with material indebtedness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>88</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose that before you became a believer, you had extorted or defrauded others, stolen from them, or obtained things by improper means.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now that the Lord is working within, you have to deal with these things in a proper manner.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This has nothing to do with the forgiveness you received from the Lord, but it is very much related to your testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>89</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After we are saved, it is not necessary to dig up our past life to see whom we owe and to repay them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if the Holy Spirit in us makes us conscious of the fact that we owe others in material things, then we should follow His leading to properly restore them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>90</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ending the Old Way of Living</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we are saved, we should conclude our old way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we cannot find a definite example in the Bible concerning this point, we can see a hint of it from the revelation of the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That is, after we are saved, God's desire is that we bring before Him every person, thing, and affair in our living and see if we still can be related to them as we were in the former days.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are willing to go before the Lord in this way, we will see that after we are saved through regeneration, we not only should abandon the idols, destroy the demonic and dirty things, and restore what we owe, but we also should conclude entirely our old way of living and have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This does not mean that we cease to be husbands, parents, or students; rather, it means that we can no longer be husbands, parents, or students as we were in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Neither does it mean that from now on our homes should be devoid of decoration; rather, it means that the decorating should be different from before.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Concerning these things, our inward taste, our mood, and our feeling have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a matter of asking ourselves about our sins in the past; it is a matter of asking ourselves whether we, as children of God, should be the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not a teaching but the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is altogether a matter of the new man with a new living, having everything of the past living ended.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the clearance of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fourth , the extent of the clearance of the past is the "life and peace" spoken of in Romans 8:6.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have seen that the basis of the ending of the past is the moving of the Spirit, which is the feeling given to us through the inner anointing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we walk according to the Spirit, the result will surely be life and peace Rom 8:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>91 Thus, life and peace are the degree to which we are required to clear up the past.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we follow the demand of our inner feeling to confess our sins, to abandon idols, to destroy demonic and unclean things, to restore what we owe , and to end our old way of living, we will surely feel strengthened, enlightened, satisfied, and enlivened; we will also feel peaceful, secure, and full of the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>92</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
