   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN WHO IS JESUS?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:5; John 1:1, 14; Matt 1:21-23; Isa 9:6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Beginning with this message, we will have four messages on the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When a person first receives the gospel, he usually is not very clear concerning the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, after preaching the gospel, we need to declare the clear truth of the gospel to those who have believed so that they may truly know the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When they are clear about the truth of the gospel, the salvation of the Lord that they have received will be clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The most important thing to know concerning the gospel is who Jesus is, because Jesus is the center of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without the Lord Jesus, there would be no gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The meaning of the word gospel is glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These tidings are blessed because they tell us about our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without the Savior, these tidings would not be a matter of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to know the Savior who is spoken of in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not know who He is, it will be very difficult for us to understand the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Savior spoken of in the Bible is truly wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible even says, His name will be called / Wonderful Isa 9:6 , because He is so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is wonderful in His being, that is, in what He is, in who He is, and in what He does.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to spend time to see who He is because He is such a wonderful Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>WHO JESUS IS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Throughout the last two thousand years of human history, many have studied Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even when Jesus was on the earth, the disciples who followed Him were studying Him, and even though they were with Him for three and a half years, they still did not understand who He really was.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus even asked His disciples, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Matt 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They responded, saying, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets v. 14 . These opinions showed that many did not know who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Throughout the generations historians have studied Jesus, but many people still do not know who Jesus really is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even when people look in secular books, they can find many different views about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One early Chinese dictionary says that Jesus is merely the founder of the Christian religion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later versions speak of Him as a revolutionary in Judaism, and other dictionaries say that Jesus is a Western saint.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These different views show that it is not easy to know who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In spite of this, almost everyone is willing to admit that Jesus is a special and extraordinary person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Over the last two thousand years of history, it is difficult to find another person who is more revered or respected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Countless people on earth praise the excellence of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His wonderful excellence is related to who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THERE BEING ONLY ONE GOD IN THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order for us to know the Lord Jesus, we must consider the matter of sovereignty in the universe; that is, we must speak of God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we use the word God, we understand this to mean that God is the unique sovereign Lord in the universe; this is the highest denotation of the word God in the Chinese language.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order for us to know the Lord Jesus, we must know the sovereign Lord in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sovereign Lord in the universe is God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the universe there is only one God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While this is clearly spoken of in the Bible, the principles and laws of the universe also point to this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we look at hundreds and thousands of different matters and things in the universe, we will realize that this universe is in harmony because it is one in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many scientists have considered whether the universe is monistic or dualistic in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After much study, the majority of scientists conclude that the universe is monistic in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though there are myriads of matters and things in the universe, the universe is one because everything is altogether in oneness, not in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This oneness proves that the universe is monistic in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, when a country has two governments, there will be confusion rather than oneness, and if a city has two mayors, there will be confusion because there is a dual government.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When there is only one administration, confusion is avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, a country has only one government, and a city has only one mayor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The entire universe is governed by this principle of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The principles and laws of the universe are not in confusion but in order.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The administration of the universe is monistic in nature, and this monistic administration proves that there is only one God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there were two Gods, there would be two sovereign Lords, and with two sovereign Lords, there would be two administrations, two sources.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the universe were dualistic in nature, I am afraid that it would not be safe to live on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many scientists have shown that the distance between the earth and the sun is just right for human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the earth was just a little closer or just a little further from the sun, it would be impossible for human beings to exist on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This order in the universe proves that the universe is one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is only one God in the universe because the administration of the universe is one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we extend this logic to all the matters in the universe, whether big or small, the same principle applies.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For example, there can be only one leader in a country.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No country in the world has two leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether the leader is a king, a president, or called by another title, there can be only one leader.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There can be only one father in a family.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a family has two fathers, this would be a serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Likewise, there can be only one principal in a school.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There can be only one general manager in a company.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is an unchangeable principle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These examples illustrate the principle that there is one sovereign Lord in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It would be terrible if there were many sovereign Lords in the universe, because everyone could be God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If a Chang could be God, then a Lee can also be God, and a Wang and a Liu can be God as well.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This would be terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If everyone in the universe is God, the universe would be in utter chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Thankfully, there are not many Gods in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is not a God who has a last name of Chang or a God who has a last name of Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the universe there is only one God, the sovereign Lord, the Creator of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today mankind is building spaceships to go to the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Even though landing on the moon would be a marvelous matter, it would not change the fact that God is the sovereign Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God created the sun, the moon, the heavens, and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This wonderful universe come into being through Him, not through any human being.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should also consider our wonderful body.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many biologists, medical experts, and chemists have endeavored to study the human body, but in the end their studies produce more questions than answers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I once asked a medical expert what is missing in the body of a dead human in comparison to the body of a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He said that the same elements that are in a living body are present in a dead body.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>So then I asked, Why does a man die?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Something must be missing after he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He said, The only difference is that a living person can breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When I pressed him for a further explanation, he could only say that more research was needed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we do not fully understand our own body, how could we be God?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Even our lack of understanding of the human brain shows that we are not qualified to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We do not know how many hairs are upon our head or how many cells are in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we do not know even these things about ourselves, it is foolish to think that we could be equal to the sovereign Lord in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Only the Creator and Administrator of the universe can be the sovereign Lord and God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Only He is God, and in the universe there is only one unique God.</S>
