   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR WILLINGNESS TO PUT IN THE EFFORT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PURSUE THE TRUTH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE WAY WE PURSUE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Someone may ask whether it is necessary to follow a certain sequence in pursuing the truth or whether the method of teaching, reciting, testing, and praying that we used in the past is the proper way to study.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Others may ask whether it is proper for the full-timers to study gospel materials such as Gospel Outlines in order to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, in pursuing the truth it does not matter which book we study.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may study Matthew, Romans, or Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Basically, every book in the New Testament is all-inclusive, speaking mainly concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we do not need a definite sequence in our pursuing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The crucial thing is that we must be willing to spend an adequate amount of time to study.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The full-timers should spend four hours every day in the morning to study.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then they will be able to finish the entire New Testament in two years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The saints who have a heart to pursue can spend at least an hour a day; then they will be able to finish the New Testament in eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some may think that eight years is too long, but when you finish it, you will not feel that it was too long.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Bear in mind that you may start from any book.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The most important thing is that you must be willing to put in the effort and continue steadfastly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As for books like Gospel Outlines, you can pursue them when you have extra time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to spend all your effort on the study of the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After you have finished all the life-studies, you may get into the materials for gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you have studied the life-studies thoroughly, you will be able to handle all the services in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Concerning how to lead the saints, your focus should be to cause the saints to become constituted with the truth and to be able to present the truth using clear logic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Take the book of Romans for instance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The whole book can be divided into four stations, each consisting of four chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This has been clearly presented in the life-studies, and you have to make good use of them to help you to memorize these main points.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The book of Romans has four stations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Chapters one through four are the first station, which is justification.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Chapters five through eight are the second station, the station of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapters nine through twelve are the third station, the station of the Body of Christ, because chapter twelve says that as members the believers are becoming one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapters thirteen through sixteen are the last station, the station of the church life, because chapter sixteen mentions the local churches in different places, such as the church in Cenchrea, the church in the home of Priscilla and Aquila, and the churches of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the past nineteen centuries many people have studied Romans, but none of them was able to say that the last station of this book is on the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book of Romans is concerning the gospel of God 1:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As sinners, we need justification and then sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sanctification is transformation, which constitutes us into the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This Body is expressed as churches in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the subject of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Life-study of Romans takes this line as its center and speaks of numerous truths in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now a life-study of the entire New Testament has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to encourage the churches in every place to study the life-studies carefully, because the life-studies are full of diamonds.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, although we all have read Romans 8, we may not be clear concerning what it talks about.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now the Life-study of Romans tells us clearly that the subject of Romans 8 is that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you could ask Martin Luther about the subject of Romans, he would tell you that Romans speaks about justification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His explanation would stop at only the first station.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, we all have to diligently learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is what is meant by the Chinese saying, Reading is always beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as we open the life-study messages and study them every day, regardless of what chapters or verses they cover, we will profit from them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>PROPAGATING THE TRUTH TO THE HOMES AND</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>EXPECTING THE REVIVAL OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By the Lord s grace, we have already translated the life- studies into many different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the proper way to propagate the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, not only should we propagate the life-studies as literature to other countries, we should also spread them into the saints homes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the saints among us should have the life-studies on display everywhere in their homes, such as on the coffee table and the nightstand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way the atmosphere of pursuing the truth will flourish among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today the reason that the gospel of the Lord cannot be spread is that we do not know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The truth is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we speak the truth in every place, we are in fact preaching the gospel in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The entire Bible is the gospel of God, but it seems that we do not understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now we have to turn this situation around so that all the saints among us will know how to speak the truth and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This will provide the Lord a broad way to fulfill His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The co-workers in particular have to be constituted to the extent that they forget the heavens, the earth, who they are, and how many children they have.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They should know only the Bible, the life-studies, and the explanations in the footnotes in the Recovery Version of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If there were one hundred co-workers among us who really knew the truth and who spoke it every day in the meetings and in the saints homes, this would not only change the atmosphere of the church but would even shake the whole society.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the saints have life-study messages everywhere in their homes, their spiritual condition will be greatly revived.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If they have the Lord s word, it will be impossible for them not to be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This kind of prospect is not hard to attain.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As long as we are willing to take the lead to encourage the whole church to read and to absorb what they have read, revival will definitely come.</S>
