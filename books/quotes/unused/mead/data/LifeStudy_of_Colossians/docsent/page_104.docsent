   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MYSTERY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:2 Paul goes on to say that Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Embodied in Christ is all that God is and has.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the mystery of God, Christ is the embodiment, definition, and explanation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All that God intends to do is related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE REALITY OF ALL POSITIVE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, this One who is the mystery and embodiment of God is the reality of all positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Referring to the items listed in 2:16, Paul says in verse 17 that these are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are all shadows of which Christ is the body, the reality, the substance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is the real food and the real drink.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is also the real feast, the real new moon, and the real Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the embodiment of God, Christ is the reality of every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, there is no room for Jewish religion or Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is room only for the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although Paul was once very strong in Judaism, when he received the revelation concerning Christ, he realized that both Greek philosophy and Jewish tradition were nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God s economy only Christ counts for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 2:6 Paul says, As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first thing we do concerning Christ is receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we need to walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is not only our life; He is our territory, our realm, our sphere, in which we walk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In their experience many believers have received Christ as Redeemer, Savior, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we also need to receive Him as the mystery of God, God s embodiment, and as the reality of all positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to apply the matter of experiencing Christ as the reality of every positive thing to every part of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we eat our meals, we should take Christ as the real food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead of saying a word of grace in a traditional way, we should speak something higher according to the revelation in Colossians: Lord Jesus, I do not simply thank You for this food and take it into me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lord, I take You as the reality of this food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We who believe in Christ should consider all things and evaluate all things according to Christ, who is everything to us in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we consider all things according to Christ, our daily living will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 2:3 Paul tells us that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then he goes on to warn us about being deluded from Christ through someone s persuasive speech.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must not allow religion or philosophy to delude us and to carry us away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not turn from Christ to any kind of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ, the mystery of God and the substance of every positive thing, is everything to us: food, clothing, housing, transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we consider all the positive things in the universe, we should evaluate them according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What a tremendous revelation this is!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Christ we received is not a narrow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, He is unlimited, all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is not only our Redeemer, Savior, and life He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What a full and rich Christ we have received!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>WALKING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Having received such a Christ, we should now walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many Christians think of the Christ they have received only as their Redeemer, Savior, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They appreciate Him as the Redeemer who shed His blood for them, and as the Savior who saved them from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, they do not realize that the very Christ whom they have received is the embodiment of God and the reality of all positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to walk in such an all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you eat, walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you dress yourself, walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Walk in Him when you converse with your husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to be those who are filled with Christ, saturated with Christ, clothed with Christ, and fully taken over by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many of us in the Lord s recovery are not yet saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the church meetings we may pray in Christ or sing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But as soon as we get back home, we may neglect Christ altogether and live according to our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the meetings we may proclaim that to us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But in our daily life, especially at home, we may live by the self, not by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What a difference there would be if in our daily living at home we would live by Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>While a sister is cooking, she may realize that to her to cook in the kitchen is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we all exercise to live by Christ day by day, we shall live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In daily life we need to see Christ in all things and walk in Him.</S>
