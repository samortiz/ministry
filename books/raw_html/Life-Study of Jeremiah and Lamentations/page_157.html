<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Delivering the People of Israel<br>out of the Egyptian Slavery and Tyranny</H2><P>Jehovah delivered the people of Israel out of the Egyptian slavery and tyranny and brought them into the good land (Exo. 3:7-8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The People of Israel Often<br>Being Tempted to Go Back to Egypt</H2><P>The people of Israel were often tempted to go back to Egypt against Jehovah's will when they were weak or in trouble (Isa. 30:1-3; 31:1-3; Jer. 43:4-7). Because Israel was in Egypt for more than four hundred years, they were accustomed to the Egyptian ways and liked the Egyptian food (Num. 11:4-6). Hence, whenever the children of Israel had problems or were weak, they desired to go back to Egypt and take Egypt as their refuge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Chaldeans Withdrawing from Jerusalem<br>When They Heard That the Army of Pharaoh<br>Had Come Out of Egypt to Help Judah</H2><P>When the Chaldeans were besieging Jerusalem and heard that the army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt to help Judah, they withdrew from Jerusalem. Pharaoh's army returned to Egypt, and the Chaldeans returned and fought against the city of Jerusalem and captured it and burned it with fire (Jer. 37:5-8). This is a sign showing that we should not trust in the world, where man makes a living and finds enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Army of Pharaoh Neco King of Egypt<br>Being Defeated by Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon</H2><P>The army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt invaded Babylon and encamped by the river Euphrates. However, he was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (46:2). The Egyptians were soundly defeated and returned to their own land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Egypt Rising Up like Her River Nile</H2><P>Egypt rose up like her river Nile, whose waters surge to cover the land (vv. 7-8). But that day belonged to the Lord Jehovah of hosts, a day of vengeance to avenge Himself on His adversaries; for there was a sacrifice to the Lord Jehovah of hosts in the land of the north by the river Euphrates. The Egyptians were wounded so that even if they had used many medicines, there would have been no healing for them (vv. 9-11).</P>
