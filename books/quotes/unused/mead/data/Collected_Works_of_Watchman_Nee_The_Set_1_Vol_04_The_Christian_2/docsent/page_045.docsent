   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's promises are for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these few epistles God did not give one promise to the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Revelation, God never takes the whole church as a unit and promises the same reward to the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even the conditions for the reward among the seven churches are different.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, in Sardis only a few could receive the reward from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The rest were not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The seven churches did not bear the same responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Under different circumstances they bear different responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's reward is not granted to all the believers of a church but to the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Among the believers, there should be the distinction between the overcomers and the saved ones!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should differentiate clearly between salvation and reward.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All those who believe in the Lord Jesus will be saved, and all those who overcome will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not every one in the world is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way, not every believer overcomes and receives the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The worldly Christian is satisfied with "standing at the gate of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But those who know God's heart and who love the Lord will please Him in life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They will receive the Lord's smile in this age and His commendation in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the whole church has failed, if there is one overcomer, the Lord's promise will be upon him and will cause him to rejoice and be comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although this is a promise, it is not given to the fearful, the worldly, or the sinful ones, but to the overcoming ones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They sympathize with the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, the Lord comforts them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reward that the overcomers receive is the prize they obtain apart from their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The special work we perform during special trials will win us the Lord's special reward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After reading the Bible carefully, we can conclude that the distinction between the saved ones and the overcomers is merely in the coming age, that is, in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In eternity, there will not be a distinction anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, is not one thousand years very long?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our evil heart often despises the Lord's reward, but if the Lord considers it worthwhile to reward us, should we not consider it worthwhile to win it?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are many opportunities for us to overcome and to get the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those believers who love the world and who wallow in their lusts may be saved, but they cannot avoid being put to shame and suffering rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This fact should awaken us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our life is a life that wars with Satan, the world, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who overcome the sin in the flesh and the enticement of the world are few, but those who know how to attack Satan's work by prayer are fewer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not every warrior will win.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, not every warrior will receive the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, for everyone that goes to war, there is the possibility of winning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Out of warfare comes the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unless one is determined to follow God's will intently and to counter all the attacks of Satan, there is no possibility of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to pay special attention to one thing here: the victory here is not just over Satan, the world, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are, of course, items to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The overcoming here refers especially to the things in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All those who have overcome the former things must also overcome in the church!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church has left her first love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the overcomers have to keep their burning love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These will be the overcomers in Ephesus and will receive what the Lord promises here.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, the obedience to the words of the Holy Spirit is linked to overcoming here.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To hear the words of the Holy Spirit and to refuse the world and the church who has left its first love is to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How this promise fits the condition of Ephesus!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man's ancestor was originally without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God charged him not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He should have eaten of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, Satan came and deceived him to disobey God and to eat of the forbidden fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a result, he was driven out of Eden and was forever separated from the tree of life that gives eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He lost his first position.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the same way, the church was indeed holy at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet through the deception of the devil, it left its first love.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church became an organized community.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It has lost its qualification as a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the present promise is no longer like that in the ancient time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The paradise of man can no longer be found.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead, we have the Paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, according to the original language, it is "the Paradise of My God," that is, the Paradise of the God of the Lord Jesus, the God whom the Lord Jesus knows.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this Paradise there is no longer the tree of knowledge of good and evil as a test to the saints for which they are responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is only one tree, the tree of life, which affords the overcomers eternal enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What the overcomers will receive will be far more and far better than what Adam had lost.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, the condition for the possession of this tree of life is also harder.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Adam was only required to maintain his first position.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The saints today, however, must overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only by overcoming can they return to their first love.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When they return to the work of the first love, they will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Furthermore, the world has lost its paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Those in the world have been exiled from the tree of life for fear that they would live forever through eating it Gen 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But what a pity it is that man has forgotten that the world has been condemned by God!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They have attempted instead to set up another paradise here for their eternal abode!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is the love of the world that has turned the church in Ephesus cold towards the love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How would the Lord heal them?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He wants them to remember their position in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The world is not their settled abode.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They should not lose their pilgrim nature.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Paradise is their heavenly home.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Our life is hidden with Christ there.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For this reason, we should consider that as the place where our mind should be set.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Although we know that there will be a physical Paradise, and although we know that the conditions in it as described by the Bible are all physical conditions, there are spiritual significances in addition to the physical description Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>How beautiful is this picture of the holy city in eternity!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The very reading of this should stir up one's homeward desire!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>These descriptions are all physical in significance, but for now, we will consider their spiritual meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The street signifies move and work.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The river signifies the Holy Spirit as the flow that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The tree of life in the midst of the street and the river signifies that Christ is the focus of everything in the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All moves center around Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He is the life-pulse of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He is also in the midst of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Holy Spirit has the Lord Jesus as His subject on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The same is true in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Not only is He in the center, but He is on this side and that side as well.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Whichever way you turn, you will see the tree of life and its fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The passing of every month does not see the wasting away of empty and uneventful days, but the renewed tasting of the goodness and satisfaction of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Throughout our spiritual days, we will taste the manifold fruits of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The reward of the overcomers is the right to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Among the Ephesians who had forsaken Christ as the center, those who had separated themselves from the others will receive this reward.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Not only can the overcomers experience and enjoy this in the future, but they can do so even today.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Is there not even one ear to hear this word?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>May those who have an ear hear this and overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Furthermore, the tree of life in the garden has another significance, that of a dependent life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Adam should have received this.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Although he was sinless, without receiving the nourishment of the tree of life he could not have lived long.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>God would have His creatures remember that their life is one that is dependent on God and cannot be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Even the life of those who have been redeemed by the blood and who have received eternal life is dependent on God.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It lasts because it is dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Our life is one that is in Christ, that is, one that is in life, because the Son of God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We will forever enjoy His fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The most important thing for the Ephesians to do is to receive this message.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Are not the hearts of all those under the same circumstance burning because of this promise?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If man's mind, emotions, and will are independent, they are destined to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Those who do not rely on God are not able to be intimately joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>They will not be able to receive His riches as their power for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Will not all those who have realized the blessing of dependence look to the future for greater fruits in a better environment?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In that day in eternity we will realize the bliss of dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Through dependence we will taste of His eternal love.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>May the Lord gain our heart and our praises and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Amen.</S>
