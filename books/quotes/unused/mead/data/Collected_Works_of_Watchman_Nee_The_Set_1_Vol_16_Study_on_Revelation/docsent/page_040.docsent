   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Revelation 12:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since everything about this woman is symbolic, her pregnancy, birth, and crying out in 12:2 must not be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Birth has only three meanings in the Bible: 1 literal birth, 2 spiritual birth, and 3 resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since Revelation 12:2 is symbolic, this birth cannot be literal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, since the man-child shepherds the nations with an iron rod, which speaks of overcoming, this birth cannot be a spiritual regeneration either.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since it is neither the first interpretation nor the second, it must be the third, that is, a birth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The external evidence of this is in Acts 13:33 and Romans 1:4, but this chapter also contains evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The last phrase of Revelation 12:11 says that those brought forth were martyred ones, that they were dead ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These were begotten from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, it indicates resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Symbolically speaking, this is Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Christians are resurrected, Jerusalem has to pass through the great tribulation, which is like hard labor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The woman's crying out must be their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why do Christians come out of Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is because 1 the Lord is the Lion of the tribe of Judah Rev 5:5 ; 2 salvation is of the Jews John 4:22 ; and 3 Jerusalem is our mother Gal 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The dragon has two aspects: 1 the heavenly dragon and 2 the earthly devil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jerusalem also has two aspects: 1 she has a high position before God, and 2 she is a refugee on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. Revelation 12:3</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, there was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The "great red dragon" is the same as "the Devil and Satan" in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is God's adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is also the serpent in Genesis 3:1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Red is the color of war.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The "great red dragon" signifies that he is a murderer from the beginning to the end. See John 8:44 and 1 John 3:8, both of which are also recorded by John.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Seven heads."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Compare this with Revelation 17:9 and 12.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The "ten horns" are ten kings which are subordinates of the great king.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The heads are larger than the horns, while the horns execute the decisions of the heads.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the revival of the Roman Empire, the dragon will lead the ten small kings to persecute the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>D. Revelation 12:4</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"And his tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The third part of the stars of heaven that are cast down to the earth are the angels in 12:9.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One third of the angels follow the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The casting down of the dragon happens before the rapture of the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>E. Revelation 12:5</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the "woman" in 12:1 typifies Jerusalem of the nation of Israel, who then is the "man-child"?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some say it refers to the Israelites, but this cannot be true because of the following reasons:</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>1 The sun, the moon, and the stars already typify the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>2 This man-child is raptured to the throne, but the Bible never says that the nation of Israel will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This would not match the prophecy concerning Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>3 This man-child believes in the blood of the Lamb Rev 12:11 , but the Israelites never have.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some say that the Israelites will believe in the Lord during the tribulation, but the Bible never says so.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible says that when the Lord Jesus' feet stand upon the Mount of Olives, God will open up to the Israelites a fountain of salvation, and they will be saved at that time Zech 13:1; 14:4; 12:10-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some say that the man-child is the Lord Jesus, but this cannot be true for the following reasons:</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>1 The "woman" typifies Jerusalem, but the Lord was born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>2 This man-child is not an individual but a corporate entity Rev 12:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>3 If the man-child refers to the Lord, then the dragon must refer to Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But 12:9 expressly says that the dragon is Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>4 After the man-child is born, he is immediately raptured, but after Jesus was born, He lived for over thirty-three and a half years and was raptured only after His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>5 Because it is a "great" sign, the words "brought forth" cannot be interpreted literally.</S>
