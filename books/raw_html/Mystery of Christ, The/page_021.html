<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 6:6; 8:4-5, 12, 14-17; 9:3-6, 10-12, 17; 19:6; James 5:14-16; Matt. 18:15-16, 19-20; 1 Tim. 4:14; 5:22; 2 Tim. 1:6</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE APOSTLES' LAYING ON OF HANDS</H2><P>There is an example in Acts 8 that shows us the principle of the Body. At that time the church in Jerusalem suffered great persecution, and except for the apostles, all the disciples were dispersed. Philip was not an apostle; he only took care of the distribution of food. But because he had life, he went down to Samaria and preached the gospel. Many believed and were baptized, and there was "much joy in that city" (v. 8). But there was a difference between these saved ones and the believers in Jerusalem. These saved ones did not have the Spirit upon them yet. Therefore, the apostles sent Peter and John as representatives to fill up the lack. They laid hands on the new converts, and the new converts received the Holy Spirit.</P><P>What is the significance of the laying on of hands? According to Leviticus, when a man offered a sacrifice, the offerer had to lay his hands on the offering. This means that the laying on of hands is a sign of identification. Many places in the New Testament speak of the laying on of hands. First Timothy 5:22 says, "Lay hands quickly on no man," lest, as Paul explained, we should "participate in others' sins." This shows once again that the laying on of hands signifies an identification. We have to be careful lest we "participate in others' sins." In the Old Testament, when kings or priests were appointed, there was the laying on of hands as well as the anointing upon the head. Hence, there are two main meanings of the laying on of hands: It puts the believers under the anointing of the Head, and it brings the believers into the fellowship of the Body.</P><P>The apostles are the representatives of God. They are also representative members in the Body of Christ. When Peter and John laid their hands on the believers in Samaria, their act brought those upon whom they laid hands under the authority of the Head and into the fellowship of the Body. This means that they were acknowledged as part of the Body. Once they were brought into the one Body and came under the one anointing, the Holy Spirit immediately fell upon them. If the saved ones in Samaria had received the Holy Spirit before the apostles arrived, Philip would have been able to boast that Peter and John had their work in Jerusalem while he had his work in Samaria. If this had been the case, the saved ones in Samaria would have become separate from the saved ones in Jerusalem. If some had claimed Peter for Jerusalem and others had claimed Philip for Samaria, the principle of the Body would have been broken. The events in Samaria show us that unless one submits to the Body, he cannot receive the anointing. We cannot have the anointing if we do not recognize the Body. The Holy Spirit is not given to individuals but to members of the Body. The apostles' laying on of hands brought the believers into the fellowship of the Body. Hence, the laying on of hands acknowledges that there is union, fellowship, and one Body. The Body is one; therefore, the members need to recognize their dependence not only on the Head but also on one another.</P><P>Hebrews 6:1-2 speaks of six items as "the word of the beginning." The laying on of hands is one of the six foundational matters of the Christian life. These six items can be divided into three groups. The first group includes repentance from dead works and faith in God. This is an inward attitude or action taken by one toward himself or toward God. The third group includes the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment. These are teachings that have to do with things in the future. The second group includes baptism and the laying on of hands. These two items are outward testimonies. Baptism and the laying on of hands are two testimonies of the church that are essential for those who are to "be brought on to maturity." We have not neglected five of these items, but we have neglected one of them&#151;the laying on of hands. Although the Bible does not clearly say that we must practice the laying on of hands, it does show us that at the time of the apostles, a man received the laying on of hands as soon as he was saved and baptized. By baptism we enter into Christ. By the laying on of hands we enter into the Body. Believers are put not only into Christ, but also into the Body of Christ. This is our proper position. We know that every believer should break bread on the Lord's Day. The breaking of bread refreshes our memory of the significance of baptism and the laying on of hands. By baptism we bear witness to the fact that we have put off ourselves and the world and entered into Christ. By the laying on of hands we bear witness to the fact that we have left the ground of being an individual and taken a stand on the ground of the Body. Henceforth, even if circumstances take us to a place of geographical isolation, we will not be alone, because the whole Body will be with us. If we suffer, all of the members will suffer with us, and we can count on them coming to our aid continually.</P><P>At the time of the laying on of hands, if the Holy Spirit gives prophetic prayer for the one who is being brought under the anointing, then the specific features set forth in prophecy will characterize the future life and ministry of that one. We have an illustration of this in the case of Timothy. When Paul and the elders laid hands on him, prophetic utterance was given, and Paul later exhorted Timothy to not neglect the gift imparted to him, but to fan it into flame (1 Tim. 1:18; 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6). If we truly have a revelation of the Body, we must have the laying on of hands. It is our testimony to the reality of the Body and our commitment to the life of the Body. By this we declare that everything is for the Body and nothing is for the individual. If the Lord cares to use us, praise Him; if He chooses to use another, praise Him still. There is no room for jealousy in the Body of Christ.</P>
