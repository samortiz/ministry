<P>The Bible is a book written not only by the Spirit but also with the Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21; 2 Sam. 23:2). God's move in man is altogether a story of the Spirit. Without the Spirit, there is no history of God because God is totally a matter of Spirit. The difference between God's move, God's act, God's work, and religions is that religions do not have the Spirit. They may have some spirits, but those spirits are demonic, devilish, and satanic. There is only one genuine, divine Spirit; that is God Himself. In this message we want to begin to study the definition of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. IN THE OLD TESTAMENT THE SPIRIT IS:</H2><P>In the Old Testament, the Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Spirit of holiness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Spirit of God<br>in God's Creation of the Universe</H2><P>Every story in the Old Testament is related to God. The first story is concerning God's creation of the heavens and the earth, with millions of items, and His creation of man. In this story the Spirit of God is mentioned. Genesis 1:1 says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Then the following verse says, "The Spirit of God brooded over the face of the waters" (Heb.). Thus, we see that the Spirit was the Spirit of God in God's creation of the universe. In creation God's name according to the Hebrew was Elohim, the mighty One and the faithful One.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Spirit of Jehovah in God's Reaching<br>of Men and in His Care for Men</H2><P>After His creation, God began to work on man. In God's work on man, His name is Jehovah. The Spirit of Jehovah is in God's reaching of men and in His care for men (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; Gen. 6:3a). The title Jehovah literally means "He that is who He is; therefore, the eternal I Am." As Jehovah, He is the One who was in the past, who is in the present, and who is to come in the future (Rev. 1:4). Jehovah simply means to be. God was, God is, and God shall be forever. He is the great I Am.</P><P>God told Moses that His name was "I Am That I Am" (Exo. 3:14). This means, "I am always the thing which should be." If there is a need of light, He is the light. If there is a need of life, He is the life. He is everything. The Lord Jesus Himself told us that His name is "I Am" (John 8:58). The name I Am means that the very One who works on man is everything to man. He takes care of man and He comes upon man. This is Jehovah in His reaching of man and in His care for man.</P>
