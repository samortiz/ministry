<h2 class="head1">II. HAVING PUT OFF THE FALSEHOOD</h2><p>Let us now consider the details of a living of learning Christ. In verse 25 Paul says, &ldquo;Wherefore, having put off the falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another.&rdquo; Falsehood here refers to anything that is false in nature. As we have put off the old man, we have also put off everything false. If we have the enjoyment of Christ, then in a practical way in our daily living we shall put off every false thing. The most honest and faithful people are those who have the full enjoyment of Christ. When we are filled to the brim with Christ, all falsehood will be put away from us.</p><h2 class="head1">III. SPEAKING TRUTH EACH ONE WITH HIS NEIGHBOR</h2><p>Having put off the falsehood, we should speak truth each one with his neighbor. When we are filled with Christ, our speaking will be of things that are true. In our speaking there will be no lies and no vanity.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. BEING ANGRY AND NOT SINNING</h2><p>Verses 26 and 27 say, &ldquo;Be angry, and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation, neither give place to the Devil.&rdquo; Anger itself is not sin, but it is dangerously close to sin. We should not continue in anger, but rather relinquish our anger before the sun sets.</p><p>According to the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus sometimes was angry. But His anger was always under control. Hence, He could be angry and not sin. It must be the same with us in our daily living. Our anger must be under control. Otherwise, serious damage will result. In order to control our anger, we need much grace. The more we enjoy Christ, the more our anger will be limited and controlled.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Not Letting the Sun Go Down<br />on Our Indignation</h2><p>In verse 26 Paul tells us not to let the sun go down on our indignation. We should be slow to become angry, but we should be quick to relinquish our anger. According to this verse, we should not keep it past the setting of the sun. We should not let our anger carry over into the next day. According to the Scriptures, we must relinquish our anger before the sun goes down. We all need to practice this. For such a practice, we need God in Christ as grace. If we have the supply of grace, we shall be slow to anger, and we shall not remain angry very long when we do become angry. If we have grace, our anger will not linger.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Neither Giving Place to the Devil</h2><p>Verse 27 says, &ldquo;Neither give place to the Devil.&rdquo; According to the context, to continue in anger is to give place to the Devil. In nothing should we give any place to him. If we hold on to our anger, we are actually welcoming the Devil. But if we relinquish our anger, we close the door to the Devil and give him no place.</p><h2 class="head1">V. LETTING HIM WHO STEALS STEAL NO MORE</h2><p>Verse 28 continues, &ldquo;Let him who steals steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with his own hands that which is good, that he may have to share with him who has need.&rdquo; In a book of such high revelation, the apostle still touches things on a practical level, even such low things as anger and stealing. Stealing is due mainly to slothfulness and greed. Hence, the apostle charges him who steals to labor instead of being slothful and to share what he gains with others instead of being greedy.</p>
