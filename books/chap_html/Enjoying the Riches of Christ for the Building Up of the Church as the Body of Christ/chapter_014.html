<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH AND THE WINDS OF TEACHING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:13-14; Rev. 2:2-4, 14-15, 20, 7, 17; 3:20</h1><p>Ephesians 4:13-14 says, “Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.” Recently I was invited to a certain locality. On the first day I arrived, some older ones came to me, saying, “You have to do something to help us. Our young people are a problem. You don’t know how loud they are! We older saints cannot bear that.” After not too long, the younger ones also came and said, “You have to do something to help us. The older ones are so dead. We cannot tolerate them. Today the young people are so active, and we cannot be with those dead ones.” I was in a real dilemma. Both the old ones and the young ones put pressure on me. Sometimes in our meetings we are active outwardly, and some pious, godly people cannot bear this. However, being loud or quiet is not a part of our faith. Rather, this is a matter of particular teachings.<p>There has been much disputation and fighting among believers concerning the Lord’s table. We have spoken with different kinds of believers concerning this matter. Some say that using a single, large cup is not healthy and passes germs to everyone. However, if we change to using many little cups, people may say, “Doesn’t the Bible speak of one cup? There is only one Body, not many.” In the Lord’s table meeting should we use unleavened bread or leavened bread? Some say it must be leavened because the church today is not pure. In Matthew 13:33 the three measures of meal were leavened, typifying the situation in Christianity, so some say it is scriptural to use leaven. Still, some say the bread must be unleavened. First Corinthians 5:8 says, “So then let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.” Unleavened bread is also scriptural. Some would also ask what we use in the cup: juice or wine? The Lord Jesus spoke of neither juice or wine, but the “product of the vine” (Matt. 26:29). This really puzzles people. Some people also argue about which day to have the Lord’s table. They say, “Every day is the Lord’s Day. Acts 2 says that the disciples broke bread from house to house day by day” (v. 46). Others question if the Lord’s table should be in the morning or in the evening. Some say that since the Lord’s table is a supper, not a breakfast or a lunch, we cannot have it in the morning. There are many such arguments. I cannot tell how many different opinions we have faced in the past forty years. These things are not items of the faith.<h2 class=head1>THE FAITH</h2><p>The faith is the items in which we believe. Because we believe these items, we are one with the Lord. If we do not believe them, we are separate from the Lord and are lost. Our faith consists of the Bible, God, the person and work of Christ, and the church. Christ was incarnated to be a man, and He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. He went to the cross and died there, not merely due to persecution and not for martyrdom but for our redemption. Moreover, He was resurrected on the third day, He ascended to the heavens, and He is still there. He will come back as our Lord, our Bridegroom, and our King. This is the work of Christ. We must believe in this.<p>Moreover, Ephesians 4:3-4a says, “Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace: one Body and one Spirit.” We must also believe that the church is the unique Body of Christ. It is unique universally, and it is also unique locally. The Bible, God, the person and work of Christ, and the church are the unique items we must believe in. About these there should not be any argument. These are not winds of teachings. Everything other than these, whether or not it is scriptural and sound, belongs to the winds of teachings.
