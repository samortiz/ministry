How can we prove that the death of Christ was such an all-inclusive death? How can we prove that the cross gives us God? All this is proved by the design and measurements of the altar.</p><p>The clear details of the altar are a special characteristic of Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision. The earlier books of the Bible do not speak specifically about the measurements of the altar in such a particular way, but Ezekiel gives us details concerning the altar. If we consider <a href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/LSEzekiel/chart3.pdf" target="_blank">figure 3</a> (altar detail), we will see that according to Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision the altar has four sections: the base, the lesser ledge, the greater ledge upon the lesser ledge, and the upper altar upon the greater ledge. The upper altar is called the hearth of God, the place where something burns for God and by God.</p><p>Let us now briefly consider the measurements. The base of the altar is one cubit high. The number one signifies the unique God; thus, the base of the altar being one cubit high indicates that God is the base of the altar. This means that the cross was initiated by God. The lesser ledge, which is upon the base of the altar, is two cubits high. Here the number two signifies not only a testimony but also the second person of the Triune God. Christ is the second person of the Triune God as a witness. The third section, the greater ledge, is four cubits high, signifying the creatures. The upper altar on top of the greater ledge is also four cubits high.</p><p>The top of the altar is a square, twelve by twelve cubits. The number twelve is composed either of six times two or of three times four. In this case all these numbers are involved. The number four signifying the creature, the number six signifying man, and the number three signifying the Triune God are all here. From all this we can see that God is here, that Christ is here, and that all creatures, including man, are here.</p><p>God as the base includes Christ. When Christ died upon the cross, God, man, and all the creatures died there with Christ. Therefore, this altar signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ.</p><p>Because the death of Christ is mysterious, there are many different opinions concerning it. An unbelieving Jew might say simply that a man named Jesus, the Nazarene, died there. Many of today&rsquo;s believers would say that the One who died on the cross was their Redeemer. Other Christians, who are more advanced in their spiritual understanding, might say that Christ their Redeemer and they themselves died on the cross. However, I would declare that not only Christ, my Redeemer, and I died there, but also all the creatures and God Himself died there. The whole universe with the Creator has passed through death. Because everything has passed through death, everything could be tested. Whatever could be terminated by death was terminated. Actually, only God was able to pass through the test of death. We and the entire creation were terminated, but God was able to pass through the test of death.</p><p>The all-inclusive death of Christ worked out a mingling which brought man into God. In that death God died in man to be released, and man died in God to be terminated. Praise the Lord that in the wonderful, all-inclusive death of Christ, God died in man, and man died in God! Hallelujah for Christ&rsquo;s releasing and terminating death! In His death we were terminated, and God was released.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HEARTH</h2><p>The top of the altar, the hearth of God, is twelve cubits square. This is the fireplace of God, the place of God to burn things for God, to God, and by God. It is significant that the hearth measures twelve cubits by twelve cubits. This is the first time the number twelve is used in the temple measurements. The number twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem and is composed of three times four. The number three is the number of the Triune God, and the number four is the number of man as a creature. The number twelve, therefore, signifies the Triune God mingled with man. The New Jerusalem will be the consummate mingling of the Triune God with man. The church life today is also the mingling of the Triune God with man.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GREATER LEDGE</h2><p>The greater ledge, the section which is directly under the upper altar, has an edge on either side which measures one cubit. This is why the greater ledge is fourteen cubits wide. The number fourteen is composed in two ways: seven times two and ten plus four. Seven is the number of completion, two is the number of testimony, ten is the number of fullness in perfection, and four, of course, is the number of the creature. By putting all these numbers together, we can realize that this signifies that the creature in fullness bears a complete testimony.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_089.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_091.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Ezekiel &nbsp; pg 90</div><br></body></html>
