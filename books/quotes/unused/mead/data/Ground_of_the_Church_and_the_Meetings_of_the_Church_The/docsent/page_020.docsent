   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE PRACTICAL POINTS CONCERNING THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING COMING ON TIME TO THE TABLE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Often the attendants at the Lord's table meeting do not come on time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the start of the meeting, perhaps only onethird of the attendants are there; then gradually some more come.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It may be twenty or thirty minutes later that all the saints have gradually come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This spoils the meeting very much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose that five persons play in a basketball game.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first one comes to play by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later another one comes, and after five minutes or more the third, fourth, and fifth ones come.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What kind of game would that be?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose again that someone invites twenty people to attend a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First eight come, then six more, and then gradually the rest come.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The food will be spoiled by that time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We put so much stress on the Lord's table meeting because it is very important and means very much for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order for the church to be strong, we must have a proper meeting for the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we have to endeavor by the Lord's grace to start the table meeting with all the members present.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should have a feeling of shame whenever we come late to the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a real shame to come late.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If someone invites me to attend his feast and I am the last one to come, I would feel shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are invited by the Lord to His table, so we have to come on time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we all come on time, the meeting will be very much strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BEING SEATED PROPERLY IN THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes, the way we seat ourselves in the Lord's table meeting is too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At times there are many people on one side of the room and empty seats on the other, without any balance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is hard for those who sit in the corner to hear the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all should learn how to seat ourselves when we come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are the first ones to come to the meeting, we should sit in the front, a section at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those that come next should fill in the second rows, and those who come afterward can fill the remaining rows.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To fill the seats in a proper order truly strengthens the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we arrive in the meeting, we should look at the situation and know where to sit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why we ask some brothers to be ushers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all love the church, and we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to have a proper church life, we must learn to care for these practical matters, even though they are small.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>PRAYING AND ANNOUNCING HYMNS IN A PROPER WAY</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Third, we must learn to speak audibly in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we pray, we have to exercise both our spirit and our voice so that others may hear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to take care of others' ears.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To announce a hymn weakly, for example, damages, kills, and quenches the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we announce a hymn, we have to announce it loudly and properly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should learn the above small matters so that the Lord's table meeting will not have weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the attendants should come on time; it is good even to come five minutes before the scheduled time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we should learn to seat ourselves in a proper way and pray and speak in a way that everyone can hear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These matters will help the meeting very much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>PROPERLY BEARING THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even if the brothers and sisters come to the Lord's table meeting on time and seat themselves properly, they may still not be ready in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there is not much exercise of the spirit, if the spirit of all the attendants is dormant, we can all sense it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The shortcomings in the table meeting are due to the silence of those who should be bearing the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At times, the sisters function too much because the brothers are late or "buried" when they come.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the brothers are "buried," it is hard for them to care for the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this case, the weaker ones come in to take their place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the fault not of those who function incorrectly but of those who do nothing, who do not bear the responsibility for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If those brothers who should bear the responsibility do not do their duty, that becomes the weak point of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They should not complain about those who function wrongly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The two feet have to function, but if the feet do not function, the two ears will take the responsibility to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This creates a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The biggest mistake in the Lord's table meeting may be that many who should share the responsibility do not do their job; they just "retire."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because too many retire, the wrong functioning comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If certain ones retire from their responsibility, we must then exercise our spirit to rescue the meeting, to bring the meeting back from being lost.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all need to learn, to be trained, and to practice these things.</S>
