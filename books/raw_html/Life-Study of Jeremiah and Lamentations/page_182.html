<h2 class="head1">II. THE FIRST LAMENTATION&mdash;<br />
A LAMENTATION OVER THE DESOLATION<br />
OF THE HOLY CITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Her Distressing Circumstances</h2>
<p>In her desolation, the holy city was in distressing circumstances (1:1-11). She had no comfort, rest, or pasture (vv. 2-3, 6, 9) because of her transgressions, sins, impurity, and uncleanness (vv. 5, 8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Her Entreating the Sympathy of the Passersby</h2>
<p>Verses 12 through 19 speak of her entreating the sympathy of the passersby. Her circumstances were miserable (vv. 13-17) because of her rebellion against the commandment of Jehovah, who is righteous (v. 18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Her Prayer to Jehovah</h2>
<p>Verses 20 through 22 are her prayer to Jehovah. In verses 20 and 21a she begged Him to see her in distress. Then in 21b and 22 she asked Him to deal with those who would not comfort her.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE SECOND LAMENTATION&mdash;<br />
A LAMENTATION OVER THE DESTRUCTION<br />
OF THE HOLY CITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah the Lord&rsquo;s Destruction<br />
of the Holy City</h2>
<p>In 2:1-10 we have a word concerning Jehovah the Lord&rsquo;s destruction of the holy city. This destruction was in His overflowing wrath, in the indignation of His anger (vv. 1-2, 6). The destruction included the temple, the altar, the kings, the priests, the princes, the prophets, and the elders (vv. 6-7, 9-10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Prophet&rsquo;s Lament</h2>
<p>Verses 11 through 19 are the prophet&rsquo;s lament. In verses 11 and 12 we have the prophet&rsquo;s weeping and his inward feeling of pains because of his people&rsquo;s suffering; in verses 13 and 14, the serious &ldquo;sickness&rdquo; of the people of Jerusalem; in verses 15 and 16, the hissing and insulting of the passersby; and in verse 17, the fulfillment of Jehovah&rsquo;s commanded punishment. Then verses 18 and 19 tell of the need to cry to the Lord with eyes that weep unceasingly and hands uplifted toward the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Her Prayer to Jehovah</h2>
<p>The last three verses of this lamentation are her prayer to Jehovah. She begged Him to see her in her slaughter (v. 20a) and in the killings she had undergone (vv. 20b-22).</p>
