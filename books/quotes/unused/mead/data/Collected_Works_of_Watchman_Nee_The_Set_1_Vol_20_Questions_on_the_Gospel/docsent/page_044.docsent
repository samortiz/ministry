   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION THIRTY-FIVE CONCERNING BELIEVING AND PERISHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible says that the Lord Jesus died for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Will a person perish if he does not believe in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died" 2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The "One" in this verse refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The "all" in "One died for all" refers to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the Lord Jesus' death is a death for all, it might seem that a person will not have to die even if he does not believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the Bible also says, "He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God" John 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How do we explain this in view of God's righteousness and God's administration?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us consider this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Matthew 20:28 says, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Timothy 2:6 says, "Who gave Himself as a ransom for all."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the difference between "many" and "all" in these two verses?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew says that He died "for many."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Many" refers to many people; it includes all those who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus died for and on behalf of the many who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Timothy says that He gave His life as a ransom for all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This refers to the Lord Jesus as a ransom prepared for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus' death is for believers as well as on the behalf of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But His death is only for sinners and not on the behalf of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The extent of His death on behalf of men is limited before God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus, on the one hand, died for and on the behalf of the many; on the other hand, He died for all men but not on behalf of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"One died for all" 2 Cor 5:14 means that the death of the Lord Jesus Christ is prepared for all men to apply; it does not mean that the Lord died on behalf of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Bible refers to all or all men, it only uses on behalf of.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that the provision of the Lord's death is available to all men so that all men will have a chance to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when the Bible refers to the believers, it uses both for as well as on behalf of.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the death of the Lord Jesus is most righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If He had not died this way, there would be no righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whoever is in the Lord Jesus Christ considers His death as a death on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But whoever is outside of the Lord Jesus Christ does not consider His death as a death on their behalf; they can only consider that the Lord Jesus has died for them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This can be likened to a meal that was prepared for them that they did not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First John 2:2 says, "And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ became the propitiation not only for us who believe, but also for those who do not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We, however, have to be clear that the word "for" in this verse does not mean "on behalf of."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's salvation is already prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But not until we receive this salvation does God reckon us as one of the "many."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ died for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His death was a provision for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet His death is not on behalf of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a person does not believe in Christ, he will surely perish.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is man's responsibility before God.</S>
