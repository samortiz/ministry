   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 PETER 1:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Peter 1:2 shows us the working of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse are the foreknowledge of God the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ the Son .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Father as the source foreknew us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Following the Father's foreknowledge, the Spirit came to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His sanctifying work was to separate us and bring us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the aspect of the Holy Spirit's sanctification before Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then there is the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, the Son, indicating Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sanctification of the Spirit is divided into three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first is for our repentance, the second is for our justification, and the third is for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the book of Romans, Christ's redemption is revealed first and then the Holy Spirit's sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in 1 Peter 1:2 the sanctification of the Spirit is first, and then the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ follows this sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why we need to see the different aspects and stages of the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Luke 15 the Lord Jesus told three parables.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first parable, the good shepherd goes to find the lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second parable is that of a woman seeking her lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The third parable reveals a loving father receiving a returning prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These three parables reveal the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Son is the good shepherd, the Holy Spirit is the seeking woman, and God the Father is the loving and receiving father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Luke 15 the seeking woman lights a lamp, sweeps the house, and seeks carefully until she finds her lost coin vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>8, 10, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This typifies the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He enlightens us from within and searches out our sins one by one that we may know our sins and repent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This sanctification of the Holy Spirit causes us to turn to the Lord and receive God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before we received the Lord, we were living in the world with the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But one day the Spirit came to find us, to separate us unto God, even before we were redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He sanctified us, separated us unto God, before we were forgiven of our sins and justified by God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His sanctifying work separated us unto God so that we would come to ourselves Luke 15:17 , repent, and turn to God Acts 26:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The seeking of the woman in Luke 15 typifies the initial sanctification of the Spirit which is the sanctification of the Spirit revealed in 1 Peter 1:2.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we can see that 1 Peter 1:2 unveils the divine economy through the operation of the Trinity of the Godhead for the believers' participation in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God the Father's selection is the initiation; God the Spirit's sanctification carries out the selection of God the Father; and God the Son's redemption, signified by the sprinkling of His blood, is the completion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>LUKE 1:35</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Luke 1:35 is a verse concerning the divine conception of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this divine conception, the Divine Trinity is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Luke 1:35 shows the Holy Spirit's coming upon Mary; the Most High, God the Father, overshadowing Mary; and the birth of the holy thing, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, the entire Divine Trinity was involved in the conception of the Man-Savior.</S>
