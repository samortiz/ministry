   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S WAY OF REDEMPTION A Message on the Lord's Day Morning Issue No. 25 Scripture Reading: Gal 4:4-5; Rom 10:17; Heb 11:6; Gal 4:6; John 14:26; 16:13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Deep within me I feel the need to give a message on the significance of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 11:6 says, "But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The most important thing in the entire life of a Christian is to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a Christian does not have faith, he cannot be well pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why is faith so important?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I recently looked into a Bible concordance regarding the word faith and found that almost everything was through faith; this is by faith and that is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All of the grace that God has prepared for man is received through man's faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Faith is so important.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God does not grant grace with respect of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people are obedient and well-behaved, yet God does not grant them much grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to see that there are four steps involved in God's way of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, there is the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God caused Christ to accomplish redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through the death and resurrection of Christ, God accomplished redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, God proclaims what He has done through His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Word of God proclaims Christ's accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Third, man believes in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We first believe in the Word of God, not the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ's work satisfied God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ fulfilled God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We rely on the work of Christ and believe in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the Word of God, we cannot believe the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without the Word of God, we cannot understand the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, believing in the Word of God is believing in the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fourth, the Holy Spirit applies the accomplishments of Christ to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Bible mentions the Holy Spirit, it pays particular attention to His fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Holy Spirit applies to us what Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Holy Spirit is leading us into God's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Truth is reality, the reality of all spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Bible, truth indicates Christ and His accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord says, "I am...the reality" John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Truth also refers to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord says, "Your word is truth" 17:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit ushers us into Christ and His accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Holy Spirit also makes the Word of God real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is God's way of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not have faith, we do not have anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although Christ has accomplished everything and God has spoken, if we do not believe, the Holy Spirit can do nothing and we cannot obtain anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What does Christ's work include?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A few weeks ago I spoke on the riches in Christ and mentioned that sanctification, perfection, freedom from condemnation, deliverance from sins, holiness, pleasing God, etc. are all included in Christ's accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Christ died, we died in Him; when Christ resurrected, we resurrected in Him; and when Christ ascended, we ascended in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A certain magazine once said, "When Christ was on the cross, not only was His physical body there, but the spiritual body was also there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The body He obtained from Mary was there, and even the mystical body was on the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not seek to die or look for death, because Christ has accomplished this for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are weak, someone may tell us that we should die, that if we die, we will not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the Word of God tells us that we died nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have no choice; God has accomplished this for us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sinners cannot be saved through works.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once we realize that salvation is through the work of Christ, we will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today many Christians appear to be dead even though they are not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They fail today and again tomorrow; all of their efforts are in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brothers and sisters, we are hearing a wrong gospel if it requires us to work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bible says that "in Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ" Col 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ did this for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should see what has been accomplished in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ's accomplishments are for our perfection in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Holy Spirit puts whatever is in Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ not only died, but also resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When Christ died, we died; when Christ resurrected, we also resurrected; and when Christ ascended, we also ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our inheritance in Christ is beyond our imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we read the Bible, we ought to pay attention to one question: should we pursue the things that are in Christ, or have we already obtained them?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once I asked a brother, who was reading Romans 6, how much he needed to do and how much had already been done concerning death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He answered, "I need to die and resurrect."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I responded that my Bible did not say that; rather, Romans 6 says that we have died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All we need to do is just consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Men in the world talk about death and resurrection, but their talk is not based on Christ's accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, they can never experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thank God that Christ has died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even though Christ has accomplished this, without God telling us so in the Bible, how could we believe?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Without God's Word, none of us would know that Christ died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God's Word tells us the facts in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, we believe in God's Word, not just the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How can we believe if we did not see the death of Christ with our own eyes, and some of us do not even know where Israel is.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Word of God, however, has told us that Christ died and resurrected for us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God commanded His servants to write down the accomplishments of Christ so that we could believe.</S>
