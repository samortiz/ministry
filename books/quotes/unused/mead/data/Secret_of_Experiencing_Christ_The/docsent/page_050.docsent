   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTINUAL EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD'S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we have the assurance that we are eternally saved, we still need to be saved day by day and even moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this continual experience of God's salvation, we need the Word, faith, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These three elements are like a threefold cord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this threefold cord, constituted of the Word, the Spirit, and faith, we are saved from all the negative things in Ephesians: blindness, ordinances, winds of doctrine, vanity of the mind, and Satan and his evil powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, it is by the Word with the Spirit producing faith that we receive a spirit of wisdom and revelation and are enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is also the way for Christ to spread Himself throughout our inner being and to settle, make His home, in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Ephesians 3:17, Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, when our mind is saturated with the Word, the Spirit spreads into our mind, and we are renewed in the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>FILLED, WASHED, ARMED,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AND EMPOWERED</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the Word with the Spirit we are also filled in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 5:18-20 speaks of being filled in spirit, speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we compare this passage with Colossians 3:16 and 17, we see that the Spirit fills us through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, to be filled with the Word is actually to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the Word coming into our being and filling it, we are also washed; we are cleansed by the washing of water in the Word Eph 5:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the New Testament, this water, the water in the Word, is the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we receive the Word into us, the water in the Word will wash away our inward filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Ephesians 6:17 and 18, if we receive the Word into our being by means of prayer and petition, we shall put on the armor of God and be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apart from the Word, there is no way for us to have the armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To put on the armor of God is to receive the Word by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our experience confirms this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we come to the Word and take it into us by pray-reading, singing, or musing, we eventually sense that we are armed, equipped, and empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have the confidence that should Satan attack us we would have the power and the armor to defeat him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can even say, "Satan, don't you see that I have put on the armor of God and that I have been empowered to defeat you and to put you to shame?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are thus able to fight the spiritual warfare and defeat the evil powers of darkness in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>ENJOYING CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the Word with the Spirit producing faith we experience Christ and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to your experience, when do you have the highest enjoyment of Christ and the church?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is it not when you take the Word into your being through the Spirit by praying in spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we pray-read the Word, we receive the Word not merely into our mind, but also into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in our experience Christ becomes available, present, and real, and we rejoice to be in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ephesians 6 speaks of taking the Word by praying at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to do this in a practical way, it is good to carry a pocket version of the New Testament with you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Should you be delayed in heavy traffic on the way home from work, you can open this pocket version and pray-read a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even in the midst of a traffic jam you can enjoy pray-reading a verse like Philippians 2:9: "God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a brother pray-reads the Word on the way home from work, he will be happy with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How different this is from coming home exhausted and finding his wife worn out from the day's labor!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When a brother and his wife are exhausted and not enjoying the Word, neither is likely to be happy in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At such a time, it seems that Christ has disappeared, and there is no incentive or desire for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The secret of experiencing Christ and the church is in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we take the Word in a proper way, we experience Christ and enjoy the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may even feel like singing, "Unto Him be glory in the church."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever we enjoy Christ and the church in this way, Satan, the Devil, is under our feet.</S>
