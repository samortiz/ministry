<h2 class=head2>9. The King of Kings and Lord of Lords Defeating Antichrist</h2><p>In Revelation 19:11-21 we see Christ as the King of kings and Lord of lords defeating Antichrist. Verse 11 says, “I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.” Christ will be faithful in destroying Antichrist and true in carrying out God’s economy. He will judge and fight in righteousness, even judging by fighting. When Christ comes to judge Antichrist, Antichrist will be utterly rebellious. Thus, there will be the need for Christ to fight to subdue this rebellion and judge it in righteousness. His judging by fighting will not only be according to righteousness but will also maintain righteousness.<p>As the One who defeats Antichrist, Christ is called The Word of God (v. 13). The Word of God is the definition, explanation, and expression of God. As the Word of God, Christ speaks for God not only by imparting life as grace to God’s chosen people but also by executing God’s judgment upon Antichrist and his followers. Even as the Lord fights, He speaks for God and expresses God. God is righteous and sovereign. He is also a God of order and cannot tolerate disorder and rebellion. As Christ fights against Antichrist, He will declare that God is sovereign, righteous, and orderly, that God is over everyone and that He does not tolerate rebellion against His authority. Christ’s fighting against Antichrist, therefore, will be a powerful speaking. It will tell Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, and the entire universe that God is sovereign and that no one can rebel against Him.<p>Revelation 19:15 says, “Out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword.” When the Lord Jesus comes to fight against Antichrist, He will simply need to speak a word. This is the Lord’s way of fighting. Undoubtedly, Antichrist will use the most modern weapons, but Christ will defeat him with the sharp sword, the almighty word that proceeds out of His mouth.<p>Revelation 19:16 tells us, “He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.” The fact that this name will be written upon Christ’s garment and thigh indicates that it will be openly revealed and known to all. The garment signifies Christ’s attributes, especially His righteousness in His humanity, and the thigh signifies His standing strength, His stability. His title King of kings and Lord of lords is exhibited in His righteousness and stability.<p>Revelation 19:19 speaks of Christ’s enemies: “I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army.” Christ’s enemies are the beast, Antichrist (undoubtedly including his associate, the false prophet), and the kings of the earth and their armies. The kings of the earth especially include the ten kings under Antichrist (Rev. 17:12-14), and the armies include the two hundred million cavalry troops from the rising of the sun (Rev. 19:16; 16:12).<p>In Revelation 19:20 and 21 we see Christ’s defeat of Antichrist and his armies. “The beast was seized, and with him the false prophet.…These two were cast alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone” (v. 20). Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first to perish in the lake of fire. All the rest will be killed “with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse” (v. 21). This is Christ in the divine administration as the King of kings and the Lord of lords defeating Antichrist.
