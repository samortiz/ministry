<H1 CLASS=MSG>SUB-SECTION SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PHILADELPHIAâ€”<br>THE FAITHFUL LITTLE FLOCK<br>(3:7-13)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSE SEVEN</H2><P>Verse 7:"And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write: These things says the Holy One, the true One, the One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens." </P><P>This period of church history is very interesting and crucial. How wonderful it is when we consider that the Lord has only praises for their situation and nothing else. In this letter the Lord does not have one word of rebuke. There are words of warning, and we should pay attention to them, but there is no rebuke at all. How good it is that such a holy and true One would show us His smiling face! Of course, this is the proper condition for Christians to have all the time. But we have to praise God that in the history of the church, although the condition of Philadelphia was not found before this time, Philadelphians already existed. When John was writing this letter, there were already people like those described here. The more adverse the condition in the world, the more the Lord praised them. No matter how much opposition there was in the environment, nothing could stop them from being the Philadelphians. Circumstances could not stop them. On the contrary, these encouraged them to become the Philadelphians. This is the condition for being a Philadelphian. If we have the spirit of the Philadelphians, all the sins in the world or in the church will only make us more Philadelphian.</P><P>Before we study this letter in detail, let us first try to understand the nature of Philadelphia. To understand Philadelphia, however, we must first remind ourselves of what Sardis represents. Sardis undoubtedly refers to the predominate state churches established after the Reformation. Among them, the power manifested in the Reformation was lost. Many people were Christianized, but they were living in name only. In reality they were dead. Although among them there were living and faithful ones who had not defiled their garments and who were worthy to be clothed in white and to walk with the Lord, those in the midst of Sardis were not able to make Sardis like them. Actually, Sardis is just the world. It is the world Christianized, but still the world. The only difference is that there are some Christians scattered among it.</P><P>In principle, Philadelphia is absolutely different from this. The principle of "brotherly love," the meaning of the word Philadelphia, is a union in life. This shows the work of the Holy Spirit in recovering the true church. Although the true church was lost in the confusion of Sardis, the Holy Spirit is uniting the Body of Christ apart from all names on the basis of brotherly love. We have heard much mentioning of the term revival. Actually, many revivals are but a fresh manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit in God's Word for the salvation of sinners and the edification of believers. There is no return to the original ground, as we have mentioned earlier. But here, the situation in Philadelphia is a revival of the church. In Sardis we see the revival during and after the Reformation, but in Philadelphia we see a further revival. Not only are the extreme sins removed, but there is a return to the original condition of the church. The original condition of the church is one in which there is no denial of the Lord's name and there is the keeping of the word of His endurance.</P><P>The tone set by the Lord in this letter shows us that this portion of the Scripture (Rev. 3) is not talking about the church in the first centuries or in the Middle Ages. It should be the church in this age developed from the first centuries and the Middle Ages. Sardis is the beginning of the church in this age; there were no defiling sins, but there was the lack of vitality. Anyone who has any spiritual insight will see that Protestantism has not succeeded. The present situation of Protestant churches is a cause of shame for those who call themselves Protestants. Men now boast of the fact that they have freed themselves of the tyranny of the Pope, the authority of the church, the sin of worshipping the virgin, the saints, and the angels, and the heresies of the Mass and purgatory, etc. But are these all the fundamental teachings there are? A man can be delivered from all these sins and be a most proper Protestant, yet be utterly unconcerned for the love and glory of Christ and be involved in a thousand other kinds of sins. Many disputes seem to be questions of outward opinions. Actually, the inward struggle is for the covering-up of one's own faults and shortages.</P><P>One thing can be said: in no other place in the Scripture can one find more comfort to encourage those who faithfully love the Lord Jesus and His interest on earth than in this letter. This letter tells us what the Lord's eyes are set on and are appreciating during the last few pages of the church's history on earth. It is not the corruption of the Catholic Church, the ceremonies of the Protestant churches, or the lukewarmness or pride of Laodicea. There may be some remnant in Thyatira. There may be a few faithful ones in Sardis, and perhaps some in Laodicea may open the door to let the Lord in. None of these, however, will satisfy the Lord's heart. What the Lord wants is a little flock who will completely and fully honor His name and keep His word. We have to remember that Thyatira and Sardis are very ecclesiastical. They appear in the world as very organized and "orderly" organizations. Philadelphia and Laodicea are more a description of moral condition than of organization. It would be easier for us if we read on with this in mind. In Philadelphia, we see everything differently. What draws our attention first is not what the Lord has done or what He has but who He is.</P>
