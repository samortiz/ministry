   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Facts</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word fact is not in the Bible, but in reality, there are many accomplished facts in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A fact can also be called an accomplished work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Saying it in this way may make it more easily understandable.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the difference between a fact and a promise?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is a fact?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The death of Jesus Christ on the cross is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The coming of the Holy Spirit is also a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are these promises?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Strictly speaking, they are no longer promises.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Old Testament they were promises.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But now they have become facts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament God promised that the Lord Jesus would be born of a woman under the law and would redeem men under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This promise has been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of the promises in the Old Testament have become accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Can we kneel down and ask God to let the Lord Jesus die for us and redeem us again?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No, we cannot!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But I have heard many people who pray this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Solomon prayed for God to fulfill in him and accomplish what He had promised to David.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But he did not need to ask God to make him a king because he was already a king.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Doing so would be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The crucifixion of the Lord Jesus has been accomplished once for all!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The advent of the Holy Spirit has also been accomplished once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no need for more prayer and beseeching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, God has accomplished many other things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All these have become facts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible shows us that many things concerning life and godliness have been accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All these are accomplished and, therefore, are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As far as God's promises are concerned, we have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not pray, we will miss these promises because God will not work to accomplish His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we do not pray, will God's facts the accomplishments of the Lord Jesus not be fulfilled in us?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No. Whatever is a fact is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no more need to ask for it again or beseech God to accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All we have to do is believe that it is true and apply it as if it is real.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Word of God shows us that even a dying sinner can be immediately regenerated and saved if he believes in God's Word and accepts His facts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is possible because the redemptive work of Christ has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Bible God never asks us to do anything that He regards as an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All we have to do is to fulfill one simple step believe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A promise is different.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A promise can be delayed, while a fact cannot be delayed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the one hand, we cannot receive God's fact and, on the other hand, say that God will only give us what we want five years from now.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What God has accomplished and has given to us in Christ cannot be withheld for a later time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even God Himself cannot withhold His facts or delay giving them to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If there is any withholding or delaying, it is a contradiction of the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Friends, the redemption of Christ and the coming of the Holy Spirit are not the only facts; even many things that we daily attempt to solve but cannot are facts; Concerning this point, we can look at Ephesians 2:1-10: "And you, though dead in your offenses and sins, in which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience; among whom we also all conducted ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest; but God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ by grace you have been saved and raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus, that He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ...and raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brothers and sisters, in verses 5-6, the word "together" is used three times.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are these words God's promises or are they God's facts?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God did not say that before we can be raised and ascended, we should do good and overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said that when He raised Christ from the dead, He also raised us up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When He caused Christ to ascend, He also caused us to ascend.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All these are accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Can any one of us ask God to raise him and let ascend him with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No. There is no need.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you have been joined to Christ, you are raised and ascended already.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is nothing more to ask for.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If this was a promise, there still might be a need for asking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if it is a fact, there is no need to ask and no need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should continually pay attention to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many people cannot differentiate between God's fact and God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They think that they must ask in order to obtain the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But what is the result of this asking?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more they pray, the more they lose their faith; they pray their faith away.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All we have to do is to apply God's fact.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is only a need to apply; there is no need to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God has shown us that the facts that He has given us are accomplished matters; there is no need to ask for them anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our death, resurrection, and ascension with Christ are accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We do not ask for God to give us a resurrected and ascended life today.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we ask, God will answer, "You have the resurrected and ascended life already."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No Christian has received a life that is not the resurrected and ascended life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we think that we can only obtain by asking, we still do not know God's accomplished works.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A promise is something that God will give us, while a fact is something that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>A promise is the word God will give to us when we are in trouble and pray to God for help.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We can hold onto these words of promise and receive His help.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Facts are all the things pertaining to life and godliness which God has already given to us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They are God's accomplished works.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Since God has given them to us, there is no need for us to seek for them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All we have to do is to apply them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Glorious facts!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Accomplished facts!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All the facts that Christ has accomplished are ours.</S>
