   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We want to continue to see the divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man, who was a man of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His mystical human life was a divine realm, and this realm is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The genuine and proper prayer should always be divine, not just spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that the Triune God prays with us and that we pray by living with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is indwelling us and is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Testament reveals clearly that the consummated Spirit, the Spirit of God as the life-giving Spirit and the Spirit of Christ, indwells us Rom 8:2, 9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second Timothy 4:22 says that the Lord is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The consummated God today as the compound life-giving Spirit indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are human beings, no doubt, but the divine person was added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For us to be spiritual is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to see that God has made Himself one with us and made us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, each of us believers is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this sense, we are God in life and in nature, but of course, not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because we have been born of Him to be of His species John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are one kind with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Based upon this revelation, we can see that genuine prayer should be the divine expression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we pray by ourselves, that is the human expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we pray by living with God and moving with Christ, we pray from this Person and our prayers are divine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I feel that this is a new revelation to us in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only a divine person could pray, Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified Matt 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A divine, human person is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is altogether mystical.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a realm in this universe which is divine and mystical.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The worldly people do not know this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are in the physical, fallen, sinful, evil world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we have been separated from being common; we have been sanctified and separated unto our God, who is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we are in the divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. In His Supreme Teaching on the Mount,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>the First God-man Teaching His Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Twice concerning Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Matthew s record is concerning the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen the divine fact of His fasting in the wilderness for forty days and forty nights.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we want to see His supreme teaching on the mount concerning prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Bible scholars call this the sermon on the mount, but I do not like the word sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, I use the term supreme teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No teaching in human history is higher than this one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In His supreme teaching on the mount, the first God-man as the King-Savior in the kingdom of the heavens taught His disciples twice concerning prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first time is in the middle of the supreme teaching, and the second time concludes His supreme teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The First Time Unveiling the Heavenly Vision concerning the Prayer Which Is Critical</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>to the Kingdom Life</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many so-called churches today recite the prayer which the Lord taught us to pray in Matthew 6 vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>5-18 , but most do not understand the real significance of what they are reciting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This prayer is critical to the kingdom life, a life that lives in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This one prayer also is accompanied by four negative charges as warnings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>a. The Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The prayer is as follows: Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Give us today our daily bread.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Amen vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>9-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The praying ones must be children of God, born of God, so they have the authority, the right, to call God their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot call a person our father if we are not born of him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have a Father in the heavens who has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This brief but critical prayer covers a number of crucial items.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>1 The Father s Holy Name to Be Sanctified</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To be sanctified means to be separated and distinct from all that is common.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the fallen earth there are many false gods.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The worldly people consider our God as being in common with those gods.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we pray for our Father s name to be sanctified, we should not just utter this with our words.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For His name to be sanctified, we should express Him in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must live a sanctified life, a daily life separated from being common.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To pray such a prayer requires us to be sanctified persons, those who are separated from being common.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should be distinct, separate, from all of the people around us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In other words, we should be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As sanctified people, we should pray, Our Father, Your name be sanctified.</S>
