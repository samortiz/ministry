This is the initiation of the divine dispensing, making us branches of Christ as the true vine. We were wild olive branches (Rom. 11:17), but now we have become the branches of the cultivated vine (John 15:1, 5). As the branches of the resurrected Christ, we live with Him, grow with Him, and work with Him. This is the result of regeneration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE CHRIST AS THE LIVING WATER<br>WATERING THE BELIEVERS,<br>AS THE LIVING BREAD FEEDING THE BELIEVERS,<br>AND AS THE CONSUMMATION OF<br>THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD FLOWING<br>FROM THE INWARD PARTS OF THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>As the consummated Spirit of the divine life, Christ is the living water (John 4:10, 14). He is now watering the believers with Himself. As the living bread, which is the real manna from heaven, He is feeding the believers (John 6:49-51, 63). Furthermore, as the consummation of the processed Triune God, that is, as the consummated, all- inclusive, compound Spirit, He is flowing from the inward parts of the believers (John 7:38-39). In the Christian life, from the day we are regenerated, He waters us, feeds us, and flows out from within us every day. This is the process of dispensing. Watering is a dispensing, feeding is a dispensing, and flowing also is a dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN THE GOSPEL AND THE WORK<br>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br>BEING THE SUPPLY TO THE BELIEVERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In Fruit-bearing</H2><P>This divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity becomes the supply to the believers in the gospel and the work. The first item of the gospel work is fruit-bearing, that we may dispense the riches of the divine life to others. To bear fruit is to preach the gospel by dispensing the riches of Christ into others (John 15:4-5, 16).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
