<h1 class="title">LEADING NEW BELIEVERS TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT AND<br />
THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>After leading new believers to experience Christ as life, we need to lead them into a deeper experience. We should lead them to experience the Holy Spirit and the cross, that is, to experience the Spirit of life and the cross. Thirty years ago we were not clear concerning the experience of the Spirit of life and the cross. Based on our study, knowledge, and experience of the truth in the Bible in the last thirty years, this matter has become clear to us. Our experience of the Spirit of life and the cross must be simultaneous; we cannot have one without the other. If we live Christ and experience Christ as life, we will see that the Christ whom we experience is the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>Before 1949 we rarely used the phrase <em>the Spirit of life</em> in our publications. At that time we saw only the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2; we did not see the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45. In resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit. The terms <em>the Spirit of life</em> and <em>the life-giving Spirit</em> are slightly different in meaning. The emphasis of <em>the Spirit of life</em> is related to the truth, whereas the emphasis of <em>the life-giving Spirit</em> is related to experience. We did not see this point until we left mainland China and came to Taiwan.</p>
<p>From the ministry of Brother Nee we see that in order to experience the death and resurrection of Christ, we must experience life. In his latter ministry Brother Nee spoke strongly on this point, saying that without the experience of life, one can never experience the cross. He said that the fact of our co-death with Christ in Romans 6 can be experienced only in the Spirit of life in Romans 8. In chapter 6 we have the fact of our co-death with Christ but not the experience. Our co-death with Christ can be experienced only in the Spirit of life in chapter 8. Brother Nee&rsquo;s speaking helped me greatly. Through his speaking I was able to see further concerning the life-giving Spirit and to see that this life-giving Spirit is an all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>However, at that time Brother Nee did not say that the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death is in the Spirit of life. Neither did he say that the Spirit of life contains the element of Christ&rsquo;s death. In his ministry he did not point out that the Spirit of life is the all-inclusive Spirit, the compound Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF GOD BEING PROCESSED<br />
TO BECOME THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>To compound is to combine several elements so as to form one substance. Before the Lord was incarnated, the Spirit of God was simple, containing only one element, divinity. When the Lord was incarnated, divinity was mingled with humanity, and humanity was mingled with divinity. Therefore, at the conception of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God had a new title&mdash;the Holy Spirit. Previously, the Spirit of God merely possessed divinity, but after incarnation the Lord brought divinity into humanity so that divinity was mingled with humanity. As the One who was conceived of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin and as the God-man who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature, the Lord Jesus lived a human life for thirty-three and a half years. Then He went to the cross, passed through death, entered into resurrection, and ascended into heaven. Hence, after the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, several elements were added to the Spirit of God. These elements include the Lord&rsquo;s human living and His all-inclusive death on the cross. His death terminated all of the old creation and released the divine life.</p>
<p>The Lord entered into resurrection after His death; hence, the element of resurrection was also added to the Spirit of God. Now the Spirit of God has the elements of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. John 7:39 says, &ldquo;The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; The Spirit, as spoken of in this verse, was &ldquo;not yet&rdquo; until Jesus passed through death and was glorified in resurrection. This Spirit is the life-giving Spirit spoken of in 1 Corinthians 15:45: &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; As the last Adam, Christ was incarnated, lived on earth, died, and was resurrected. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>For thirty years we have studied the Spirit. The Spirit is the compound Spirit and also the all-inclusive Spirit because the elements of divinity, humanity, human living, the all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension have been included in the Spirit. Hence, Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This Spirit can supply whatever we need.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
