   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RUTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A. The writer s , the place, and the time: The book of Ruth is connected to the preceding book of Judges and the following books of Samuel in history and in time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, it was most probably written by Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Its events take place between 1322 B.C. and 1312 B.C., but they were recorded much later, after David had become king.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. The subject: Boaz is seen as one valuing the God-given birthright and ushering in the king that built the kingdom David.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>C. The background: This book is part of and a supplement to the book of Judges.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Judges is a book of the history of darkness and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this book is likened to an oasis in the desert or a bright star shining in a dark night.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It causes the reader to rejoice and get excited.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>D. The central thought: That man may have the birthright through the redemption of Christ and a union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>E. The general sketch: In the book of Ruth, Boaz typifies Christ and Ruth typifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This book shows us how Boaz redeemed both Ruth and her birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The birthright included a double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship, that is, the right and position to enjoy Christ fully with the privileges to be a priest to bring people to God and a king to bring God to men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ruth was Naomi s daughter-in-law, and both had lost their birthright due to poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to God s ordination, the recovery of one s birthright required the redemptive effort of a kinsman.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Boaz treasured the God-given birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was not only concerned for his own birthright, but also for that of others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He paid a price to redeem his kinsman s inheritance and married his widow Ruth 4:1-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was due to his compassion on the poor and weak Ruth and his redemption of her birthright that David, the king that built the kingdom, was brought in.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>F. The sections: 1 the loss of the birthright 1:1-5 , 2 the desire for the birthright 1:6-22 , 3 the seeking of the birthright chs.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1 SAMUEL</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. The writer s , the place, and the time: The first twenty-four chapters of 1 Samuel were probably written by Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Chapter twenty-five, verse 1 says that Samuel died.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, from chapter twenty-five on, the rest of 1 Samuel and the whole book of 2 Samuel were surely not written by him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Chronicles 29:29 says that regarding the things of David, there was not only the recording of Samuel, but also the recordings of the prophets Nathan and Gad.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Bible scholars have concluded from this verse that the recordings in the books of Samuel after the death of Samuel must have been continued by the prophets Nathan and Gad.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book of 1 Samuel was written in Canaan and covers the period between 1171 B.C. and 1056 B.C.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. The subject: The degradation of the priesthood, the establishment of the prophethood to speak for God, and the anointing of the kingship after God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>C. The background: The priests occupied an important position, because the people needed to go through the priests when they served and drew near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But Eli the priest was weak, thus, the priesthood had deteriorated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, God needed to establish a prophet to speak for Him so the people could come to God through him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, God wanted a habitation on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He used Samuel to anoint David, a man after His heart, to be the king and to build His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>D. The central thought: Prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hannah s prayer produced a son fruit .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Samuel s prayer caused Israel to win the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Samuel prayed for a king according to the request of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He regarded prayerlessness as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>E. The general sketch: The key word for this book is prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Samuel means God listens to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God gave Samuel to his mother Hannah because of her prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Samuel lived in the temple from his youth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eli the priest had allowed the priesthood to deteriorate due to his weakness in disciplining his two children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God bypassed Eli and established Samuel to speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Samuel was a praying person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Israelites wanted a king.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Samuel anointed Saul to be king.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Saul rebelled and was given up.</S>
