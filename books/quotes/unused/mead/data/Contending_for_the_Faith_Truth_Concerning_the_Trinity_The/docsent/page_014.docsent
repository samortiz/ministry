   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Everything we preach and teach in this ministry is thoroughly and carefully considered.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Years ago, under the leadership of Brother Watchman Nee, we not only studied the Bible, but also church history, biographies, autobiographies, and the writings of the important Christian teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After much study and investigation, we were enlightened by the pure Word, and the Lord revealed much concerning Himself as our enjoyment and concerning the church as God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before the recovery came to this country, had many of you heard of the human spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Had you ever heard that for Christ to be experienced by us as the all-inclusive One, He must be the life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Had you ever heard that the Triune God is for the dispensing of Himself into us, His chosen people, for our experience?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Had you ever heard of the practice of the church life in the localities where we are?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Years ago, the Lord enlightened us and revealed these things to us, and we have been practicing them for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today, we wish to present the truths we have seen to all Christians that they may see them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At least, we must clear up the sky for the truth that the Christian public may know where the truth is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everyone must know the truth concerning the living experience of Christ, the dispensing of the Triune God, and the practice of the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After much study, we have been confirmed in believing that, according to the Bible, the Triune God is revealed, not for doctrinal apprehension, but absolutely for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we try to understand the Triune God as a doctrine and neglect experience, we shall find ourselves in difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was young, I was taught about the Trinity according to the Nicene Creed, the creed held both by Catholicism and Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was under the teaching of the Brethren assembly, I was told that we should pray to the Father in the name of the Son through the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But as I practiced this in my experience, I got into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I asked myself, "To whom shall I address my prayer to the Father, to the Son, or to the Spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As I prayed, I had to remind myself, saying, "Don't make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You must pray to the Father in the name of the Son through the power of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I took caution to practice in this manner.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I first stayed with Brother Nee, a Chinese evangelist who belonged to the China Inland Mission was invited to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Nee told me privately that this brother was supposed to be the most spiritual one among the Chinese preachers in the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At a certain point in his message, he said, "Don't think that the Lord Jesus is separate from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Holy Spirit today is simply the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After this sentence was uttered, Brother Nee, sitting afar off, loudly said, "Amen!"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That surprised me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As Brother Nee and I were taking a walk after the meeting, he said, "Witness, we must believe this and realize that today the Lord Jesus is just the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From that time onward, I received the best help to experience Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In all the years since then, I have entered more and more into the reality of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In doctrine, we may speak of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as being separate and distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But what about our experience?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to our experience, are They three or one?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The New Testament reveals that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us Eph 4:6; 2 Cor 13:5; John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Tell me, according to your experience, are there three in you or one?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you exercise your mind to talk about Them, They are three, but when you exercise your spirit to experience Them, They are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Recently, I read the writings of many others who have said affirmatively that the Triune God is not for doctrinal understanding, but for our experience of the reality of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If our Savior were not the life-giving Spirit, how could we touch Him?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to fundamental interpretation, we touch Him through the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But what does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is meaningless terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What does it mean to say that the Son comes to us in the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, it says, "Christ in you, the hope of glory" Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ dwells in us and abides in us directly, not through any power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But where is the verse saying that Christ lives in us through the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no such verse.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Neither is it so complicated in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In our experience, the living Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we turn to our experience, we shall see that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The all-inclusive Christ, who as the life-giving Spirit indwells our spirit, is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must believe the clear Word in a pure way, saying, "Amen," to whatever the Bible says, and we should take care of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is no need to interpret.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Simply take whatever the Bible says and believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>by Witness Lee</S>
