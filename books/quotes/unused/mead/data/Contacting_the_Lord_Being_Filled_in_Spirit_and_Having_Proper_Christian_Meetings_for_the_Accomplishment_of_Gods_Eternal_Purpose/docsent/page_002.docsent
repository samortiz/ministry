   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THREE GREAT MATTERS IN THE SCRIPTURES Scripture Reading: Eph 3:11; Gen 1:26; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 GOD S MOVE IN THE UNITED STATES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before I moved to the United States, I had no thought that I would ever do so.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I visited the United States, I came simply as a visitor with no intention to stay, but while I was here, I carefully observed the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One night while I was in San Francisco, I told the brother with whom I was staying that I had the definite sense that the Lord wanted to do something on the West Coast of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After staying with this brother for two or three nights, I left the United States and had no plans to return.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My thought was that if the Lord wanted to do something in America, He would surely raise up some saints in America to do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After a while, although I still had no thought to move to America, I felt that the Lord was urging me to visit again.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of this, I came to the United States for a third time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My intention was to stay for three months and then to return to the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the three months were nearing an end, I made arrangements to visit Taiwan and Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything was ready for my departure, but the Lord would not allow me to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord simply kept me here.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was a great suffering to me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I desired to leave, but the Lord would not allow me to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, I became clear that I had no other choice but to submit myself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I told the Lord, Lord, I have to go along with You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I give up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I will go along with You, and I will stay here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then I became very clear, and I immediately sent a cable to the Far East, telling the brothers there that I would not be able to return.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I also made a call from Seattle, where I was staying at the time, to San Francisco.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I told the brother there that I had the burden to visit Sacramento and then to go to Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Shortly after this, I visited Sacramento.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That was the first time I visited a place without first being invited.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time the Lord greatly used two books written by Watchman Nee The Normal Christian Life and The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Prior to the publication of these two books in America, I visited place after place and saw that the Lord had raised up seeking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I also observed that nearly all these seeking ones had been raised up by the Lord in the preceding two to five years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the Lord had prepared all these seeking believers, when these two books were published, the hungry Christians devoured their contents.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These two books were published at exactly the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In fact, The Normal Christian Life was published in the very same month that I became clear that the Lord was leading me to stay in America.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time, in addition to observing the tremendous response to the writings of Watchman Nee, I received letter upon letter and call after call from believers all over the country.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These things have confirmed to me that the Lord truly desires to do something wonderful in the United States in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THREE GREAT MATTERS IN THE SCRIPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this message we will consider three great matters in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first matter is God s eternal purpose, God s ultimate intention.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is a divine person with a mind, emotion, and will and is full of wisdom and desire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, in His divine mind there must be a purpose, and this purpose must be both divine and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ephesians 3:11 says, According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In light of this verse we need to ask, What is God s eternal purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The second matter that we will consider in this message is the way that God takes to accomplish His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once we have seen that God has purposed something according to His own desire, we need to find out how He accomplishes this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The third matter that we will consider is the way in which God applies what He has accomplished to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First we will consider God s eternal purpose, then we will consider how God accomplishes this purpose, and finally we will examine how the accomplishment of this purpose is applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s Eternal Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The entire Bible reveals that in eternity past, according to His own desire, God purposed to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He purposed to do one thing to gain a group of people who would be His living Body and would express God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s eternal purpose is to have a living, corporate Body through which He can express Himself as the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit will be expressed and manifested through a corporate Body composed of human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God is mysterious, infinite, and unlimited, yet He desires to be expressed and manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To this end God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man was the last item of God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that everything that God created prior to creating man was in preparation for man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once God had made everything ready, He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This reveals that man is the center of God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God created man as the center of His creation in a very purposeful way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Man was created in the image of God and committed with God s divine authority over all creation Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The fact that man was created in the image of God reveals that man was created to express God, for an image is an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, if I take a picture of you, the picture will capture your image and will be an expression of you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The fact that man was given authority over all the earth means that man is to be God s representative on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From the way in which God created man, we can see that God s purpose in creating man was that man would express Him and represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is God s eternal purpose.</S>
