   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST ONLY NOT MATTERS OR THINGS Scripture Reading: John 8:28; Col 3:3-4; 1:16-20 MAN S THOUGHTS AND DEMANDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first gift we received from God was the Son of God, who is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But different people have different degrees of knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Among God s children, some know the Lord Jesus as one of the many gifts of God, while others know Him as God s unique gift.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people confess that the Lord Jesus is God s gift, which means that they recognize Him as God s unique gift.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But many other people accept the Lord Jesus only as their first gift.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Apart from the Lord Jesus, they still see many other gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is the first gift, but there are also the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the tenth, the thousandth, and even the ten thousandth gift.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When many people believe in the Lord, they accept Him and they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after they are saved, they find that in spite of their salvation, they still have many shortcomings and needs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people find that they have a quick temper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although they are saved, they still have their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some people find that they are very proud.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although they are saved, their pride still follows them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many people find that they are weak and timid.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although they are saved, they are still timid.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, among God s children, we very often find that after many believe in the Lord Jesus and are saved, they hope, ask, believe, and pray before the Lord, and subsequently receive many gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They regard the Lord Jesus as one of the many gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They consider the Lord Jesus as one from among many gifts of God; that is, He is only the first among many gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is very interesting that at the beginning of our pursuit of the Lord we see many needs in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We think that since we are Christians, we should not do this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are very sure that we are genuine Christians, yet we still have many shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It does not matter what the shortcomings are; as long as there are shortcomings, we consider them as wrong, and we try all we can to deal with these shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, we pray before God, we hope, we believe, and we strive, and eventually we receive something.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When this happens, it seems as though we have overcome our shortcomings, and we rejoice in our heart that we have acquired a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this circumstance, many of God s children begin to think that the purpose of God s gifts and grace is just to fill up our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When some people hear this, they may ask, If God s grace is not here to fill up our lack, what is it for?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people think that God s grace is for filling up our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is like a Bible that has two thousand pages.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If it is short one page, we try to make up the missing page.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what we do when we try to use God s grace to fill up our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, we think that we are lacking just a part; we think that we are lacking only a little and that as long as we can fill up that little part, we will be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some have said that they lack five things, and as soon as they have the five things, they will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some have said that they lack ten things, and as long as they have the ten things, they will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some may say that they have love and that they only need a little more humility, a little more patience, or a few other things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as they have these few things, they say that everything will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man s thought is merely one of lack and shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What does he do?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He prays to God and asks God to give him what he lacks.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the problem is that many of us have come to realize that what we think we lack before the Lord and what we ask for are merely things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our lack and our prayers are all centered around the matters and the things; they are all individual, countable objects.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We say that we lack this or that, and if God will fill up our lack, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We lack patience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But what kind of patience are we looking for?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Most of the time our eyes do not look to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If our eyes did look to heaven, we would be looking upward.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But most of the time, we cannot look upward; we can only watch and look at what is around us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We sigh and say that certain people are good but that we are not like them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What they have is patience, and what we have is a temper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What they have is meekness, but what we have is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We wish that we could be as patient and meek as they.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once I prayed to the Lord it might have been my first prayer that God would give me a Bible like the one I saw in a certain brother s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can only pray for things that we see.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can only pray after we have seen something, and we can only pray for what others already have.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot pray for something from heaven which we have never seen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a consequence, when we pray, we ask for patience like that of a certain person, or we ask for humility like that of another person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In our mind, we already have a picture of what humility is and what patience is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If, when we were first saved, God had told us that He was going to pluck patience from a certain person and give it to us, would we not have been overjoyed?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we could have patience and humility on top of what we already had, we would have been satisfied and thought that we were perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Patience is a thing to us; it is a thing that others possess.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is a certain thing called patience among the brothers and sisters, and we want it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We often hate ourselves, and we blame our parents for begetting us and giving us such a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We wish that we could be like certain persons, because they have something which we do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many of God s children are after patience as a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They want something that will stop them from losing their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They think they need something called patience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>With many people, patience is a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God has this thing, and it is found in many places on earth, but they do not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They think they need this thing, patience, so that they can become a patient person.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Here lies the basic difference between genuine Christianity and wrong Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many of God s children are looking for things which they think can be found everywhere except in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They think that it is found in Mr. Chang, in Mr. Yu, in Mr. Hsu, or in this or that person, but not in them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are pursuing after a thing that can be found on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is Christianity in the mind of many.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They are craving for and pursuing after things, and they have acquired things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many people only acquire a thing; yet their heart rejoices and they thank the Lord because they have acquired it.</S>
