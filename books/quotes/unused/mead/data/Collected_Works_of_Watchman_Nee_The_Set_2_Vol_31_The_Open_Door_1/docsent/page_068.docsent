   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chekiang Province</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Greetings to my dear Brother Stephen in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May the almighty God Himself keep you in peace until the Lord comes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I received your letter of November 5.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The mail service was suspended for quite awhile, so it took almost one month for the letter to reach me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the fighting approached San-Chiao-Bu, God still graced us by leading us to flee to Ya-Dan-Ou, a valley in the mountains not far from San-Chiao-Bu.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are completely surrounded by mountains, so this gives us a taste of the words of Psalm 121.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I served the Lord for more than a month in Shao-Shing and then went home to take my family and flee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With regard to the work, we acknowledge that the Lord is the almighty One; man can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Mr. Sun's whole family also fled to Ya-Dan-Ou.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I think that your letter was delayed because the post office service was frustrated by the war.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many of my letters some were sent to you have been lost or delayed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May this letter reach you without delay.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The brothers and sisters in Nanking have all fled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unfortunately, all my books are there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the Lord does not want me to keep those things, I just praise and thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If this is just the beginning of the tribulation and we cannot stand it, what will the great tribulation be like?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May we both be able to keep the word of endurance, and may we keep watchful that we may be preserved from the coming tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope you can come north, but may God's will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have not written all I want to say.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May the Lord's grace be with you.</S>
