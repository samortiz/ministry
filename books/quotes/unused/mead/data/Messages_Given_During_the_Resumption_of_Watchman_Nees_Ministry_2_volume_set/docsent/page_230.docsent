   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OTHER MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We still have some announcements to make concerning other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For those brothers who are holding jobs and for those students who are still in school, we ask that they would not drop their present occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When you receive some light from the Lord, we hope that you will make adjustments according to the light you receive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE OFFERING OF MATERIAL RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning money, we need to make some public announcements.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we preach the gospel well, and if all the brothers and sisters are coordinated together, our homes, our occupation, and our money will all be for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The responsible brothers will help the saints to make proper arrangements for the possessions that they have handed over.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some money should be retained for one's own use, while other money should circulate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We hope that we will not need to spend too much time to ask how the brothers and sisters spend their money.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this matter, much of the responsibility rests with the individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church does not want to touch this matter too much.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the brothers and sisters are too much off the mark, some should remind them a little about the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The kind of living each one maintains before the Lord should be determined by each person's own standard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church cannot make such a decision for the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning the offering of material riches, we hope that part of what the brothers and sisters put into the offering box will be used for local expenses and part for the caring for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition, the brothers and sisters have to learn to follow the Lord's guidance in giving personal gifts to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The money that is set aside for the work can be dropped into the offering box that is set apart for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If everyone gives up all his excess, those who gather much will not have excess, and those who gather little will not have want.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We expect every worker to exercise faith before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not want to distribute to the co-workers the money that is designated for the work, thus making the work suffer through the lack of money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the other hand, we do not want to see any excess in money, and we do not want to see the work falling behind the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We hope to see the work and money going up in proportion to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At any rate, we hope that the brothers and sisters will do their best to be frugal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We hope that no one will try to save up his money for future use.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every time we receive some income, we have to give, and we should not worry about our future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At present, the fund for the work in Shanghai is under the management of Brother Witness Lee and Brother Tang Shou-ling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fund for the work in Foochow is under the management of Brother Chen Keh-shan and Chan Si-wen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In all other places, we will not receive money for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, if the brothers in Chefoo or Tsingtao want to offer something for the work, they should send it to either of the two places we mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CONCERNING THE RECEIVING OF CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE NEED FOR LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is one thing we would like the saints from out of town to pay attention to: You have been receiving and acknowledging co-workers on our behalf for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This practice gives us a lot of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If someone comes to your place to work, please ask him to show you the letter of recommendation from us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the past, you have acknowledged some co-workers whom we find it hard to acknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the New Testament, Paul also mentioned the matter of a recommendation letter 2 Cor 3:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today, not only is there the need for recommendations in matters related to the church; there is the need for recommendations in matters related to the work as well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a letter only recommends a certain person as a brother, you have to treat him as a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If he is also a co-worker, there should be a separate recommendation letter to recommend him as a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the Lord cause all of us to do our best to stand firm in our own position.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether a person is making money or is engaged in spiritual services, he should offer up everything he has.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We hope that we will do a proper job before the Lord in all these matters, and we hope that we will see God's blessings.</S>
