<div style='padding-left:10px'><span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12219' href='#ref_12219'>Eph 4:30</a></span> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.<br><b>fn 1 </b>To grieve the Holy Spirit is to displease Him. The Holy Spirit abides in us forever (John 14:16-17), never leaving us. Hence, He is grieved when we do not walk according to Him (Rom. 8:4), that is, when we do not live according to the principle of reality with grace in the details of our daily walk.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

This establishes the principle that we must return to the Lord first, and then the Lord will return to us.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12222' href='#ref_12222'>Matt 10:38</a></span> And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.<br><b>fn 1 </b>Christ took the Father's will and was crucified (26:39, 42). When He was baptized, He was counted as crucified, and from that time He bore His cross to do the will of God. His called ones were identified with Him. He asked them to take their cross and follow after Him, that is, to take the will of God by putting themselves aside. This demanded that at any cost they first give their love to Him that they might be worthy of Him.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12223' href='#ref_12223'>Matt 11:29</a></span> Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.<br><b>fn 2 </b>To take the Lord's yoke is to take the will of the Father. It is not to be regulated or controlled by any obligation of the law or religion or to be enslaved by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father. The Lord lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38). He submitted Himself fully to the Father's will (26:39, 42). Hence, He asks us to learn from Him.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

He who comes from heaven is above all.<br><b>fn 1 </b>Verses 31-36 unveil to us the immeasurableness, the unlimitedness, of Christ. He is such an immeasurable and unlimited One, who comes from above, who is above all, to whom the Father has given all, and who dispenses the Spirit without measure. Such a One needs a universal increase to be His bride to match Him, as revealed in vv. 22-30. He who believes into this immeasurable One has eternal life; he who disobeys this One is under the wrath of God.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
