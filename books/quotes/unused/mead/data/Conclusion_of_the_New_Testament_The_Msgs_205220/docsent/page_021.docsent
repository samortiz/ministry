   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being the Reality of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The kingdom of God is the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the New Testament, the church is intimately related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus declared, "On this rock I will build My church," and in verse 19 He went on to speak of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The words "the kingdom of the heavens" in verse 19 are interchangeably used for the word "church" in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a strong proof that the genuine church is the kingdom of the heavens in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without the kingdom as the reality of the church, the church cannot be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For the building up of the church, we need the kingdom as the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the kingdom is the reality of the church, we cannot say that the church is the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can say only that the kingdom is the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Being the Living of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The kingdom of God is the living of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A verse that strongly proves this is Romans 14:17.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to some Bible teachers, the kingdom has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They claim that now is the dispensation of the church, and the next dispensation will be that of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in 14:17 Paul does not say that the kingdom of God shall be; he uses the present tense and says that the kingdom of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the context of Romans 14, which speaks of receiving the believers, the kingdom is today's church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reality of the church life is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 12 speaks of the Body life and Romans 14, of the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that, in Romans, the kingdom life is the reality of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In a sense, it is correct to say that the present age is the church age and that the coming age will be the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, in another sense, the kingdom of God is here today, for the kingdom is the reality of the church and the living of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, the church is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since the church is the kingdom today, it is not correct to say that the kingdom has been suspended altogether until the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 14:17 proves definitely that the kingdom is the living of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, in Acts, which is concerned with the church, there is frequent mention of the kingdom 8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Acts the believers preached the kingdom of God as the gospel 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The gospel is even called the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, it is not correct to say that the kingdom is altogether separate from today's church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the revelation in the New Testament, the proper church life is the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we live under the rule of the living God within us, that is, under the rule of the kingdom of the heavens, we shall have the kind of life recorded in chapters five, six, and seven of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We shall also have a life of the kingdom practiced in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, we should not separate the kingdom of God from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Romans 14:17 we see that the kingdom of God as the living of the church is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the authority of God's kingdom operates in us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Righteousness, peace, and joy are actually the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Christ is expressed, He is our righteousness toward ourselves, our peace toward others, and our joy with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the believers live the kingdom life in the church, they will live righteously toward themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that we must be strict with ourselves and make no excuses for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To live the kingdom life in the church also means that we live peacefully toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our relationships with others must be characterized by peace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Toward others we must endeavor to pursue peace, continually seeking to be at peace with them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This peace is Christ Himself lived out from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Living the kingdom life in the church also requires that we live joyfully to God in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Holy Spirit is a Spirit of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are not joyful, this indicates that we are not in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are truly living the kingdom life, we shall be joyful with God, praising Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever we live righteously toward ourselves and peacefully toward others, we shall live joyfully to God in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such a living is the kingdom of God as the living of the church.</S>
