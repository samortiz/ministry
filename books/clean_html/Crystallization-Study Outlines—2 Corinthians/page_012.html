<li>Grace is the Divine Trinity transmitted into us for our enjoyment, the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; Num. 6:22-27; Psa. 36:8-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment (John 1:17; 1 Cor. 15:10), the love of God is God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16) as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14.</li>
