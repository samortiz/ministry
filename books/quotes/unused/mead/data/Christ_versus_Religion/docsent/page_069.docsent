   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ROOT OF RELIGION IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me warn you again of thinking that you are through with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I tell you, you may be through with religion, but religion will not be through with you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may have decided to divorce your "wife," but your "dear wife" will never leave you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This religious wife is a real wife; it is really difficult for anyone to get rid of her.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Several years ago some brothers from a certain place learned to pray-read and then returned to their meeting with other believers to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A general cry of alarm arose and it reached my ears.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Oh, oh, we cannot take this!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The people here are not used to this!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This again was the story of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They reacted just as Peter did when the Lord let down the sheet from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Not so Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Lord said, "What God hath cleansed, make not thou common."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord said in other words, "You may not like it, but I like it."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the Lord gained the victory in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Shall we limit the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who knows what the Lord will do and how far the Lord will go.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am not fighting for pray-reading, shouting, or loud praising, but I am saying that we must get rid of anything religious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may say that you are not used to something new, but the Lord says, "Behold, I make all things new" Rev 21:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What can you say?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter did have the scriptural ground in the law not to eat anything unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But today we have no ground to maintain our old kind of Christian "service."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must confess that it is pure tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peter's insistence not to eat anything unclean was fully grounded in the Old Testament Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if today you say that you do not like loud shouting and praising in the meetings, you have no ground in the Bible, not one word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord be merciful to us that we may be willing to drop all our religious concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may say something is unclean, but the Lord says He has sanctified it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may say you cannot contact the Gentiles, but the Lord says that He has chosen them before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you do not go to them, sooner or later you will meet them in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You will meet the people you despise face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then what will you do?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You say you do not like noisy meetings, but the Lord Jesus says He likes them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"I am so happy," He says, "that they are calling upon My name."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Religion has become and still is a real pit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have fallen into this pit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not mean that in throwing over religion we should be foolishly crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should in the proper sense be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet it is easy to get out of religion, but not easy to get religion out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus, when He was on earth, acted so clearly before His disciples, showing them by example His attitude toward religion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They all saw it; they were all made clear that Jesus would have nothing to do with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, they were all clothed with the Lord Himself on the Day of Pentecost and became His bold and living witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet in Acts chapter 10, chapter 15, and chapter 21, the root of religion still in them was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems incredible to us, but we must consider ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What about the root of religion still in us?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord be merciful to us.</S>
