   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR A CHANGE IN PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Such a study confirmed very much to me that there must be a change among us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Otherwise, we would be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may not take a mule wagon, yet we still may use the DC-4 of about forty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why would we not change our airplane ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jump out of the oldness and enter into the 747!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot change the truth, just as we cannot change the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But why would we not change the transportation?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is wrong with changing the transportation?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not to change the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not to change the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not to change God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not to change the great mystery, Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But surely we have to change our cold and old situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Chinese young people have good parents who have brought to them ethics and morality with a good education.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The young generation has been brought up in this good way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But today in Taiwan all those who do business, establish factories, and produce and export articles do not follow their fathers way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They pick up the American way to compete with the Koreans, with Hong Kong, and even with Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Taiwan has now had a great success and has become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Financially speaking, in the entire Far East Taiwan ranks second only to Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is due to their improvement in the way of doing things, from the old way to an absolutely new way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They do everything in a new, scientific way, according to the modern standard.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I asked the young trainees why the worldlings would be so wise to change their way in doing things, but we should be so foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They all are taking the 747, but we still prefer the old mule wagon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A mule wagon could only travel thirty miles a day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At least three or four groups of Christians around us, some even in Taipei, have made great improvements.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They all have attained to a good number.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may say that we do not care for numbers we only care for life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, without quantity could you have quality?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Quality comes from quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How much life could you have with such a small number?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Twenty years ago the membership in Taipei was over twenty-two thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who took care of the name cards can testify to this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, after more than twenty years, the membership had gone down to eleven thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The city had nearly doubled in population, but our membership had gone down fifty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is foolish to remain there without any change.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason I told the young people to not take the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even now you must respect the old generation in life and in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in the way to practice the church life, to carry out the Lord s recovery, to preach the gospel, and to teach the truth, you have to repudiate the old way to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must no longer use the mule wagon, or even the old style of airplane.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must jump into the 747.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the moral sense, you must respect your father and highly regard him, but in doing business, in teaching classes, in doing everything, even in packing a little package, you must not take his old way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must go the new way; otherwise, you will lose the market and lose your job.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today all around the earth people are competing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not think that in the field of Christian work there is no competition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a great amount of competition.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only in this country but even the more in the Far East, people take my ministry and use it for their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our Gospel Bookroom in Taipei sells books to outsiders by the bundles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They know that what we have as far as the truth is concerned is the best.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Taiwan the others use these materials, but many in the church life just put them on the shelf and are indifferent towards these treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They remain in the old, routine way to have the meetings, to take care of the church, to do the work, to preach the gospel, and to preach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything is done in a routine way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you do things merely according to a routine, even in the most scientific way, there will be no success.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In every corporation or big bank, the employees in the office may do things according to routines, but the managers have to fast.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every founder, manager, or top executive fasts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They may not care for breakfast but utilize breakfast to get more business.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They eat while they get business, but may not remember what they have eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They have no heart to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is their fast.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They have no heart to sleep; they work until midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A Japanese motorcycle corporation established a large office in Los Angeles and hired many Americans as clerks, who worked at their desk according to a routine, eight hours a day, five days a week.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But in the back rooms the Japanese work until midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They do not know what Sunday is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They do not know what the weekend is.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Their success rests in that, not in the American clerks.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I do not like to see that you co-workers and elders do a routine work, caring for the church in a routine way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then the church would be reduced to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If all the Japanese managers worked like the clerks in the front office, their corporation would be closed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In America professors in the top universities have a slogan publish or perish.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The top professors do not have a good stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They cannot sleep or eat well.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They have to write something and get it published.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Without publishing they perish.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I encourage all the young ones to pick up such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Especially with the Chinese, to have a change is extremely difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When western civilization and culture went to the Far East centuries ago, the Japanese received it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then Japan became an important power, while China remained in the oldness to be robbed by the major powers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They all went to China to exercise their imperialism, but none of the major powers could carry out their imperialism in Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Japanese picked up the new, scientific, modern, and up-to-date western culture.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They were able to compete with the western powers.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They changed, but China remained old.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>To have a change may offend the old generation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I am going to carry out a change according to the Lord s charge.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This way is not for myself or not according to my feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is for the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A quarter century ago the church in Taipei had twenty-two thousand members.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, the membership went down.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There was not much spreading or evangelizing on that island, even though the church there owns properties and has many halls.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Because of the number of saints and the flourishing economy, the church also has much money.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Recently, one hall had the feeling to spread and set up another hall in a nearby section of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Those who were there reported that they needed a large van for transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In one meeting without going home to consider, the saints gave five thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>For the thirty-seven and a half acres of land in Lin-Ko we had to pay eight hundred and fifty thousand American dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This amount was raised in almost one day from the halls of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Since the beginning of 1985 one hundred and thirty young ones have come into full-time service.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I visited their training occasionally to give some foundational matters and some principles.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In just over two months sixteen teams with six hundred people were sent out for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The center, the nucleus, of that move was the one hundred and thirty young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Within three weeks they baptized one thousand nine hundred and seventy-five people.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This came out from the absence of the old tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The sixteen teams went out in an absolutely new way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I still have the burden to bring the Lord s recovery out of the old practice and into the new.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is why I called these urgent trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If I would not do this, all the churches in the West would only copy what Taiwan is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>That would not work.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>You would merely copy the things of the new way, yet you would not take the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is what the Lord likened to putting the new wine into the old wineskin Matt 9:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The new wine will ferment and burst the old wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If you do not have a change in the way of practice in the Lord s recovery, yet you would imitate the points, this will burst your church life.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I am a little concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If you will not change, I would rather propose to you to not pick up any new points.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Just go back to your locality and manage your church in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Let me go to Taiwan to do something new in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>You are still safe.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>You will not increase much.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>You will not improve much, but you will still be quite safe.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>You will have no trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>However, if you take the new way without a real change, you will make trouble for yourself.</S>
