   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE APPLICATION OF CHRIST'S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now the question is, how can we apply this death of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was accomplished once for all by Christ on the cross, but how do we apply it personally today?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us remember that it was through the eternal Spirit that Christ offered Himself Heb 9:14 to die on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, it is only through the Holy Spirit that it is possible for us to apply the death of Christ to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We cannot comprehend it mentally.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nor can we, by exercising the mind, reckon ourselves dead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It doesn't work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The death of Christ is not in our mentality; it is in the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be in the Spirit of Christ in order to apply the death of Christ to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must contact the Lord, and be in living touch with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must be in the Spirit instead of in the mind, the will, or the emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot just reckon ourselves dead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we reckon ourselves dead, the more we will find we are alive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when we are in the Spirit, having living contact with the Lord, we will experience the death to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let me give you an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A certain brother had a very dear sister as his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This brother was frank and simple, but the sister was always murmuring and exceedingly mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She was a real test to that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day he came to one of the co-workers for fellowship, saying, "Brother, what shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have such a lovely wife, but she is continually murmuring and so mysterious."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The co-worker answered that according to the fifth chapter of Ephesians he must love her.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The husband replied, "Brother, I know that, but I cannot love her!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever I am with her, I cannot be patient with her."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The co-worker, finding that the fifth chapter of Ephesians did not help, recommended the sixth chapter of Romans, saying, "Well, brother, you must reckon yourself dead."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The husband took the word and went home to "reckon."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But before long he returned, saying, "Brother, it doesn't work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more I reckon myself dead, the more I am alive!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I cannot be dead by reckoning!"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What was the reason?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must be in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need living contact with the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then His death will be effective to us in the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The effectiveness of the death of Christ revealed in Romans 6 is in the Spirit mentioned in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we have that living contact with the living Lord in the Spirit, there is the "killing" of His death within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After many struggles, the brother was finally helped.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He realized his need to experience the effectiveness of the Lord's death by having living contact with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He learned the lesson and practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the time he tried his best to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometime later he testified: "The more I contact the Lord Himself, the more I am dead, and the more there is a 'killing' power within me."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, I would recommend that we go to the living Lord day by day, and even moment by moment, to touch Him in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we will experience the power of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we contact the Lord, the more we will be slain by His death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must live in the Spirit in order to experience the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I repeat, the only way for us to have the real experiences of the "killing" of Christ's death by the Holy Spirit is to have living contact with the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must realize that nothing from ourselves is good or desired by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has put everything of ourself to an end by the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now He has given us the Spirit, who dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must simply live and walk according to this Spirit and have living contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the effectiveness of the death of Christ will be realized in us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
