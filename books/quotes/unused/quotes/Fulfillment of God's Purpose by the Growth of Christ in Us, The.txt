Within the new heaven and the new earth is the New Jerusalem, and within the New Jerusalem, the tree of life is the center
God is the Divine Being, the almighty Creator, and we are just little creatures, yet we can have the life of God
In Christianity people speak of the Holy Spirit as an instrument or a power, but there is very little talk about the Spirit as life
They may speak about the Spirit as a power or an instrument to fulfill God's purpose, but they do not speak about the Spirit as life to us
Peter was told to go to the people and speak to them the words of life , not the words of teaching, doctrine, or knowledge
We received the Spirit of life into us when we repented to the Lord, believed into Him, and called upon His name
When you call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, that is according to the Bible and according to the inspiration within you
The Spirit is the consummate Person of the Godhead, because the Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit comes into us
We have the Holy Spirit within us as the consummate Person of the Godhead, and we have the Bible in our hand, both as God's divine breath
By this pray-reading, by this way of mingling the Bible with the Spirit as one, we take God into us again and again
God's intention is not to pass on knowledge through the Bible; God's intention is to pass on Himself through the Bible
What we need is just to take Him in, and the way to take Him in is to mingle the Holy Spirit with the Holy Bible as one
Christ is many things to us in the book of John such as the light the life the way the door the bread of life the living water etc
Christ is the bread of life, the spiritual food, but you need to contact the Spirit and the Word so that you can get this food
In this substance, this divine element, are all the items of what Christ is: the life, the light, the food, the water, the air, etc
After the Lord was resurrected, He came back to His disciples, breathed into them, and asked them to receive the holy breath
Whenever you read any verse, any chapter, or any portion of the Bible, you have to call on the name of the Lord
The eating and the drinking are included in the breathing, and the breathing is our calling on the name of the Lord
Chapter twelve shows that we all have been made to drink of one Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus
It is by this calling that you breathe, by this breathing that you drink, and by this drinking that you eat the Lord
You should have the strong sensation that if you merely read the Word without calling on the name of the Lord, that is a big loss
The Word will be one with the Spirit within you to refresh you, to water you, to nourish you, and to give you the growth
The Spirit and the bride yearn that the thirsty ones would come to take the water of life for their satisfaction
We must be willing to put aside our old concept and learn to call upon the name of the Lord, to pray by reading, and to read by praying
We have seen that the way to take in God is by contacting the Spirit and the Word through calling on the Lord in prayer
The way for us to take in the Word and the Spirit is to breathe, and the way to breathe is to call on the Lord
Today is about the same as yesterday, and tomorrow will be about the same as today as far as the growth of their children is concerned
Of course, we cannot expect to be full-grown in a quick way, but after a period of time, we should be able to see some difference
In Mark 4 the Lord Jesus Himself illustrated very clearly that there are four kinds of people related to the growth in life
You may listen to the word, and yet there may be no opening within you because your heart is hardened like the wayside
When the sun comes with its scorching heat, signifying affliction or persecution, the seed withers because it has no root
To a seeker of Christ, a seeking one in the church life, it makes no difference what kind of car or dwelling he has
Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, makes the people of God very busy so that they do not have time for God's interests
A brother may get a doctor's degree or receive a good promotion, but this may cause him to be too busy to practice the church life
We should have Christ as the very God filling up our entire being, so we all need to grow with the growth of God, the increase of God
If the dear sister would be willing and able to submit herself to her own husband, this would be a glory to God and a shame to Satan
If a sister submits to her husband out of her enjoyment of Christ, you can see Christ expressed in her submission
As we call on the Lord, pray to Him, and pray-read His word, we enjoy Christ as life, and this life transforms us
If we do everything in our daily life by enjoying the Lord, whatever we do will be the expression of God and the subduing of His enemy
Suppose another brother rebuked you, and yet you were so patient with him, without losing your temper, by the enjoyment of Christ
Shall we ask Him to give us the outpouring of the Holy Spirit by fasting, by not sleeping, or by weeping with tears?
The Bible says that God has poured out of His Spirit, not upon all spiritual or religious persons, but upon all flesh
When Saul was saved by the Lord on the way to Damascus, the Lord told him to go into the city and then he would be told what he must do
Ananias told the Lord that he knew that this man had authority from the chief priests to bind everyone who called on the Lord's name
Ananias did not say that Saul had authority to bind all the Lord's disciples but all those who call on the Lord's name
It says that we do not need to ascend to the heavens to bring Christ down or to descend to the abyss to bring Christ up from the dead
Corinthians 1:2 says that we are the called saints who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place
You will have the deep sense that whenever you call on the name of the Lord by praying and reading the Word, you are breathing the Lord
We may say that there were about one thousand people present in one of our meetings, but our report is exaggerated
The way we talk is fallen, the way we express ourselves is fallen, our attitude is fallen, and our talk is fallen
Whatever we do, whatever we are, whatever we have, whatever we say, and however we behave are altogether fallen
We need to be delivered from the way we talk to people, from the way we laugh, and from the way we express ourselves
In the fallen situation, Satan is subtle with certain persons in one aspect and with other persons in another aspect
When we call on the Lord by saying Lord Jesus we take Him in as life and this life saves us from being wild or from our natural refinement
The northerners need to be saved from their being conservative and the southerners need to be saved from their being excited
The disciples may have been excited, but the Lord Jesus was calm and told them to pick up all the fragments and put them into baskets
If you are faithful and mean business with the Lord the more you say O Lord to take in the Lord the more you will be saved from what you are
You will know how to behave yourself, not according to your life, but according to Christ as your life within you
We will convince people not just by our shouting, our praising, our singing, or our calling, but by having our being on the highest plane
You have to convince people not just by what you say or by what you claim to be, but by your being, by your saved behavior
By this renewing we will be delivered from our old manner of life, and we will be renewed into the new manner of life
Write down all the items of what you are, of what you do, of what you think, of what you have, and of what you use
It may be that you would write down more than a few hundred items to be considered in the light of the Lord's presence
Some may think that they are in the local church where they are absolutely liberated and can do everything that they like
We have to open ourselves in our will to Christ and let Christ come into our will to take full possession of our will
When the brothers buy a necktie, it seems that this is a small thing, but the principle in buying it is not small
As you are seeking the Lord so much, you need to grow up into Christ when you go to the department store to buy a tie
When you go to get a haircut, this is not a small matter, because you practice a principle of growing into Christ in all things
After you cut it, those who are spiritual know whether or not the cutting of your hair is of the flesh or of Christ
You will see the change, not by teaching, correction, or outward adjustment, but by the growth in life into Christ in all things
Timothy 2:22 says that we need to pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart
The Bible tells us that the sisters should dress in a modest way , but only the Lord knows how modest is modest
The more you go along with Him, the more you contact Him, the more you say, 'O Lord,' the more you will be restricted by Christ
As you take Him in, He will transform you in your attitude, your emotion, your motive, your desire, your aim, and your behavior in many ways
Many times we try to argue with the Lord by saying that we have the peace to do something, but eventually we lose our case
Anything that is not a profit to us mentally, physically, or spiritually is a waste, and that is something condemned by the Lord
Paul said in 1:2 that this book was written to the church of God which was at Corinth, to the church in a locality, a local church
God's intention is to build up the local churches for the building up of the Body of Christ, God's farm, God's building
Paul planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth, not to produce fruit, but to produce gold, silver, and precious stones
God can put His trust in us because through His transformation we have become the material for the building up of the church
The building material must be of the Father's nature, of the Son's redeeming work, and of the Spirit's transforming work
Ephesians 4 says that the Head of the church Christ gave the gifted persons the apostles prophets evangelists and shepherds and teachers
All these gifted persons were given by the Head to His Body, not for a direct building of the Body, but for the perfecting of the saints
The teaching must be a nourishing teaching, something that ministers the nourishment of life to us so that by it we may grow
We want to be those who are being inwardly nourished for the growth in life in the local churches for the building up of the Body
By this the Body is built up directly not by the apostles prophets evangelists and shepherds and teachers but by all the functioning members
The practical building of the local churches must be by the local members, who are the direct builders of the local church
Every member will function, that is, every joint will supply and every part will operate according to its measure
Verse 21 says that in Christ 'all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord'
The more we call on the Lord by saying, 'O Lord,' the more we take Him in as our life, and this life works within us to build up
We may be very good people, but if we do not allow the life within us to grow and transform us, we cannot be the material for the building
The more that life grows within us, the more we realize that natural affection and natural goodness have to be put on the cross and buried
They will grow, and this growth will produce gold, silver, and precious stones for the building of God's house
May the Lord be merciful and gracious to us that we who are in the Lord's present recovery may know the way of life
Life builds, and this building is not just a local matter, because a local church is a part of the Lord's Body
Each epistle is written to one definite local church, but that particular epistle is also for all the churches
We consider either that God does everything for us or that we do everything, but God's way is higher than ours
The Triune God as the divine power came into us, and this divine power has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness
We need to see that the very Triune God who is the divine power the seed of all the things pertaining to life and godliness is now within us
God has given us faith the seed of all the things pertaining to life and godliness and the Word which has the promises great and precious
All believers, young and old, have received the same three things: faith, the seed of life, and the promises of the Word
Peter 1:5 says that along with what we have received of God, we have to add all diligence to do the developing work
Hallelujah,' and exercise their spirit to rejoice in the Lord, spontaneously they would submit themselves to their own husbands
God has given all things pertaining to life and godliness, and the submission of the wives is a small part of this godliness
By comparing these two matching portions of the Scripture, we can see that the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word
If we are going to know life, to experience life, and to taste all the riches of life, we have to know this basic matter of the Spirit
Wherever they went, Christ was there, because He was within them in a mysterious way, in a spiritual way, in a way like the air
The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the incarnated afflicted and crucified Jesus and the resurrected ascended and enthroned Christ
Corinthians 12:13 says, 'For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free
In the eyes of God, the Body has been produced, the new man has been born, and the New Jerusalem is already in existence
The way to be recovered back to our spirit for the church life is by calling on the name of the Lord 'O Lord Jesus'
As we are filled with Him, the church life will spontaneously spread and there will be an increase in life and in number
When our mind, will, and emotion are flooded and filled with Christ as the Spirit, we will have the powerful, living church life
In this church life, we enjoy the Triune God with His incarnation, human living, crucifixion for redemption, resurrection, and ascension
The church life is so rich, because the church life is one with the Triune God and all His accomplishments and attainments
The Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the life-giving Spirit
He died on the cross, was buried, resurrected, and then He ascended to the heavens where He was enthroned and crowned with glory and honor
After all these accomplishments and attainments, He came down as the Spirit of power, the all-inclusive, mighty, living Spirit
Our human spirit was regenerated by the divine Spirit, who is the realization of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God
Now that we are saved, the divine Person, the divine Spirit, who is Christ Himself, is in our spirit to remain here and be our life
Hebrews 4:12 says that the word of God is living and operative as a sharp two-edged sword piercing to the dividing of soul and spirit
When a sister goes shopping, she may feel good in her soul about buying something, but there is a 'no' deep within her spirit
Many times in our soul we like to talk and tell others certain things, but deep within our spirit we have the sense not to say much
Doctrinally, it is hard to discern the difference between the soul and the spirit, but practically, it is somewhat easy
If you do not call on the name of the Lord, whatever you have read or studied concerning spiritual things is mere knowledge in your mind
If you open up yourself by using your spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus, you will get into the spirit and be in the spirit
Romans 8:6 says that to set our mind on the flesh is death, but to set our mind on the spirit is life and peace
Saying 'O Lord' continually keeps us in the spirit so that we can walk and live in and according to our spirit
Our living in the spirit is not only the victorious Christian life but also the marvelous, wondrous church life
You will see that the Christian life and the proper church life are altogether a matter of life in and by the spirit
