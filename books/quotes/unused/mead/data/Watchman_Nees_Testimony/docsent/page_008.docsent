   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer for Others' Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>About this time I met a Western missionary, Miss Groves Margaret Barber's co-worker , who asked me how many persons I had brought to the Lord in the year following my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I bowed my head, hoping to forestall further questioning, and shamefully admitted in a low voice that, although I had preached the gospel to my schoolmates, they did not like to listen, and when they did listen, they would not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My attitude was that, since they would not heed the gospel, they would have to bear the consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She spoke to me frankly, "You are unable to lead people to the Lord because there is something between God and you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It may be some hidden sins not yet completely dealt with, or something for which you are indebted to someone."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I admitted that such things existed, and she asked if I were willing to settle them immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I answered that I was willing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She also asked how I went about bearing testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I replied that I pulled people in at random and began to speak, regardless of whether they were listening or not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She said, "This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must speak to God first, before you speak to people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You should pray to God, make a list of your schoolmates' names, and ask God which of them you should pray for.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Pray for them daily, mentioning them by name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then when God affords the opportunity, you should bear testimony to them."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After that conversation, I immediately began to deal with my sins by making restitution, paying debts, being reconciled with my schoolmates, and confessing offenses to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I also entered in my notebook the names of about seventy schoolmates and began praying for them daily, mentioning their names individually before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes I prayed for them once every hour, praying silently, even in class.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When opportunity arose, I would bear testimony to them and try to persuade them to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My schoolmates often said jokingly, "Mr. Preacher is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let us listen to his preaching."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fact was that they had no intention to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I called on Miss Groves again and said to her, "I have fully carried out your instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why is it not effective?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She replied, "Do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Keep praying until some are saved."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the Lord's grace, I continued to pray daily.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When opportunity arose, I bore testimony and preached the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank the Lord, after several months, all but one of the seventy persons whose names were in my notebook were saved.</S>
