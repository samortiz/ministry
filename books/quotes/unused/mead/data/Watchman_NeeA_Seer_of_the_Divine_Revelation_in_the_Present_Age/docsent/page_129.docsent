   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After receiving a little light from God to see the Body of Christ, we feel deeply that for an individual to act alone is regrettable and that for an assembly to move independently is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we are accurate in our perception, the greatest shortage among today's believers is that they do not know what the Body life is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It seems that they have been detached from the others who are faithfully following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The individualism of believers today is almost universally prevalent, and the work of the cross, the life of resurrection, and the power of the Holy Spirit are being used almost exclusively for the development of individual holiness, for individual spirituality, and to help achieve individual victory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be an individual is truly important, but to be only an individual and not to know how to be a brother among the brothers or a sister among the sisters is simply another form of the most hateful "self."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How we wish that from now on the children of God would learn to forget about the self and to be the servants and slaves of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To this end we desire to issue a little publication entitled Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not our intention to make this publication available to all believers, but rather it is for those who meet with us and walk with us in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We will not send it to those who do not stand on the position of the church as required by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The contents of this publication will be exclusively news and prayer requests from the various localities.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The source of the news will be mainly from correspondence we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One source will be mail which we have received directly from the brothers, and another source will be letters which were written to a third party and then forwarded to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning the nature of this publication, we need to give a word of explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We know that the common practice is to publish news so that men might 1 obtain the glory and 2 use the news as a basis for advertisement to make material gain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of this, there will no doubt be some spiritual brothers among us who, desiring to avoid this kind of thing, would rather not have their news published.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must remember, however, that the fellowship of the brothers is important.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your move and the activities of the assembly in your place are the concern of all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You should not deprive your brothers of the encouragement which they might receive from you and the privilege of making supplications for your work simply because you prefer your activities to remain hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No doubt, on your part you are humble, but what about the brothers who will not receive your help?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Body life is a life of caring for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is, no doubt, wrong to seek prominence in the religious world, but to purposely hide yourself among the brothers not the outsiders is not being humble but shrinking back.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To do such a thing does not mean that you are free from self-consideration; on the contrary, it means that you are always looking at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not spiritual living, but an activity purposely performed by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May God deliver us, on the one hand, from the evils of today's religious world and, on the other hand, from excessive self-consciousness of the soul and from "deliberate humility."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please keep in mind the examples in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, the Bible says the following: "Your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world" Rom 1:8 ; "For from you the word of the Lord has sounded out; not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but in every place, your faith toward God has gone out" 1 Thes 1:8 ; and "We have heard of your faith..."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Col 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But, on the other hand, it also says, "And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared the things that God had done with them and that He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles" Acts 14:27 and "They declared the things that God had done with them" Acts 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is needed today are not spiritual giants who cultivate themselves seclusively and who are self-conceited, but we need brothers who care for others and know how to be members together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not need hiding brothers; we need helpful brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is altogether a matter of your intention.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May we, on the one hand, not purposely try to shrink back, and, on the other hand, not intentionally try to show off.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us not seek glory from men, but in all things let us seek to glorify God and to build up the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please pay your attention to the following points:</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1 Please do your best to send us news regarding the situation of the work, difficulties encountered, results accomplished, requests for prayers, and other information.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>2 In principle, all reports should be accurate, clear, and edifying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no limitation as to length and style.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>3 If some individuals should send you letters mentioning news of the assembly in a certain locality, please forward the letters to us in order that the brothers in different localities might know more about the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>4 We would also like to publish announcements regarding the assemblies and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>5 The responsible brothers in each locality are cautioned against passing on this publication to those who do not meet with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is better not to give this publication to any but those who are walking with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>6 All mail should be addressed to the Editor, Collection of Newsletters, Box 323, Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We now put this matter in the hand of God and before the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May this be acceptable to you as it is to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May the grace of God be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peace be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>a bondslave of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
