In the fourth century Cyril of Jerusalem said, \u201cThe twenty-two books of the Old Testament were translated by seventy-two men.\u201d (Cyril was born in A.D. 315.) There are two hundred sixty-three portions in New Testament that quote directly from the Old Testament, and three hundred seventy portions that imply the words in the Old Testament. However, not one portion quotes from the Apocrypha. The latter was acknowledged on April 8, 1546, only in the Council of Trent, which the pope directly administered and presided over. (Bible 2) "}]}
