<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS OF REGENERATION, THE BRASS SERPENT, AND THE BRIDE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:1-8, 9-16, 22-36</h1><h2 class=head1>MYSTERIES AND SIGNS</h2><p>In these messages on the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the writings of John, it is not our intention to review the Life-study of the Gospel of John. Our intention is to concentrate on the extract of every chapter. The way to get the extract of each chapter is to pay attention to the signs in this mysterious book. The Gospel of John is a book of mysteries and also a book of signs. A mystery points to something that is beyond our natural understanding, and a sign points to something deep. Therefore, I would emphasize the importance of these two matters—mysteries and signs.<p>All the mysteries in the Gospel of John are divine. For instance, many Bible students know that the Gospel of John is a book on life. To be sure, this life is neither physical life nor psychological life, not even merely spiritual life; it is divine life, the very life of God. Actually, this divine life is God Himself. This is the eternal life revealed in this Gospel.<p>The divine life in the Gospel of John is a mystery. Not only is the life of God a mystery; every kind of life is a mystery. This is true of our physical life, and it is also true even of plant life. The life of a fruit tree, for example, is a mystery.<p>In the Gospel of John there are many divine matters, and each of these matters is a mystery. Everything divine is mysterious and difficult to define. Although the mysterious divine things cannot be fully understood, they are facts nonetheless. We may not be able to define the mysterious matter of the divine life, the life of God, but this life exists, and it is a mystery.<p>The divine life is not only a mystery; it is also a sign. We may use our physical life as an illustration. Suppose a certain brother stands up to speak in a meeting. Within him there is the mysterious matter of his physical life. That life is invisible. However, that mysterious and invisible life can be expressed through the gestures he uses when he speaks. The brother’s gestures will signify certain things. In like manner, the mysterious, divine life may express itself in signs. In every chapter of the Gospel of John there are signs that point to the divine mysteries.<p>We have seen that in chapter one of John there are six signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God. These six signs give us a complete picture.<p>In chapter two there are two signs. The first sign, the changing of water into wine, sets forth the principle of life, which is to change death into life. The second sign, that of rebuilding the destroyed temple, shows us the goal of life, which is to build up God’s dwelling place on earth.
