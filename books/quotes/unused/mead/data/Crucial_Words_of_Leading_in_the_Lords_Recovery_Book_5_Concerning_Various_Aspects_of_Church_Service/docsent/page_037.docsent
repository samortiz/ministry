   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REASONS FOR THE PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH LIFE BEING LIMITED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we would like to fellowship concerning our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to lead the church and give accurate direction, we must have sufficient knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must know the Bible not merely in theory but more so in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To this end I have returned to the Bible many times, and especially the New Testament, to consider the matter of levels in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have been overseas for more than twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Approximately one hundred churches in America and Canada have been raised up since I went there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are also approximately one hundred churches in South and Central America that have been raised up by this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These churches and the more than one hundred churches in Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and Africa have all been raised up recently.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All these churches are in my heart, and I have been observing and considering their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition, there are three hundred churches in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Altogether there are six hundred churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In all the churches everyone wants to gain a high position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is true in the West and in the East.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Wanting to Become Great</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone regards the elders very highly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1976, during the training on the Life-study of Matthew, we read where the Lord Jesus said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant Matt 20:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During that training I told the sisters whose husbands are elders that they should say, When my husband became an elder, he became a slave Life-study of Matthew, p.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>656 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sisters whose husbands become elders in the church should not consider themselves to be first ladies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They must realize that elders are slaves and that elders wives are slaves wives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In America there are some in the Lord s recovery who travel from place to place looking for an opportunity to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such an ambition limits the Lord s spread.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many brothers and sisters who could have been useful have stopped growing in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Having Too Much Authority Being a Limitation</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the elders in the church have too much authority, it becomes a limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ten years ago there were four thousand in the children s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Based on this, I suggested that it would be good to work on the children until there were ten thousand children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now there are only five hundred fifty in the children s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The functioning saints stopped laboring in the children s work because no one promoted the work and no one sounded the call.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the end of 1980 the total attendance in all our meetings was not very high.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need statistics in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As soon as we look at the statistics, we know where the lack is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The elders administration of the church has unconsciously become a limitation to us, because they do not have a long-term view and do not bring the saints into function.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The elders are not aggressive to make arrangements, so the saints cannot do much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the elders were aggressive to make arrangements, all the saints would be able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This limitation comes from the elders having too much authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever the elders do not decide upon does not get done.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It does not seem as though this is the situation, but it is the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The root of our sickness is that the elders have too much authority, so there are levels in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose a young person wants to live in a brothers house.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The elders do not have to be involved in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They should hand it over to the responsible ones in the brothers house.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whatever decision the responsible ones make should be good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no need to obtain the approval of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the main reason that our work does not spread and advance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not mean that our condition is declining or corrupted on the negative side but that we are trying to maintain an orderly condition on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, whatever happens, even at the lowest level, has to be approved at the highest level.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a situation is a hindrance, causes much trouble, and consumes much manpower and time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Co-workers and Elders</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not Being a Special Class</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I stand before the Lord and beg that we would change our way of doing things, especially with the newly appointed elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the past the co-workers and elders among us were treated as a special class of people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such a flavor, to an extent, still exists among us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For the sake of the Lord s testimony on the island of Taiwan there should not be any special class of people among us, whether in the church or in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By the Lord s mercy, the work here was entrusted to me and has been built up by me with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord knows that I am often in fear and trembling in His presence, that I would not have a haughty manner when I contact the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, according to my observation, the co-workers have a haughty and lofty manner, and the elders have a bureaucratic flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The elders have their responsibilities, but they should not be haughty.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The elders are not higher than the deacons, and the deacons are not higher than the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There are no such levels in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Leading a church can be compared to leading a country.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A country has a constitution, and a church has the Bible, which is our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everything we do should be according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For instance, some of the elders have been serving since they were in their thirties, and they are now in their seventies.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because their physical energy is decreasing, they cannot bear too many responsibilities, but they are still elders.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How should we deal with such a situation?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How long should an elder s tenure be?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I cannot answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although I am rather familiar with our constitution, the Bible, I cannot find a word that specifies how long the tenure of an elder should be.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In practice this is a problem.</S>
