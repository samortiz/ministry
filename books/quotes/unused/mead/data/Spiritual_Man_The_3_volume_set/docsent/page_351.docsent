   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We must differentiate between suffering and sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Many are the misfortunes of the righteous man,/But Jehovah delivers him from all of them./He keeps all his bones;/Not one of them is broken" Psa 34:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>James said, "Does anyone among you suffer evil?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let him pray" James 5:13 , so that he may obtain grace and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Is anyone among you ill?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him" v. 14 , so that he may be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians 11:30 through 32 clearly depicts the relationship between sickness and the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sickness ultimately is a discipline from God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a believer will judge himself, God will cause the sickness to disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God never intends for believers to suffer sickness continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a believer removes what God condemns and, at the same time, permits sickness to stay in his body, he does not know God's purpose in allowing him to be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No discipline should last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once the cause of discipline is removed, the discipline itself should quickly disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward..."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Heb 12:11a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Believers almost forget that with God there is still an "afterward."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it" v. 11b . Discipline is not meant to last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, the most excellent fruit comes after the discipline is over.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Neither should we be misled to think that God's discipline is His punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Strictly speaking, believers will no longer be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Corinthians 11:31 makes this quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should never allow the concept of law to come in. It is not a matter of how many sins we have committed; we do not have to suffer a certain amount of punishment before our sins can be balanced out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not an affair to be settled in court but a problem to be dealt with in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we turn back to the direct teaching of the Bible, we will see what God ultimately wants of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to read only one verse, and the concepts of many will be completely overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Beloved, concerning all things I wish that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers" 3 John 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a prayer which the Holy Spirit reveals to the apostle, and it shows God's intention towards the believer's body and His desire in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has no intention for His children to remain sick all their lives and unable to actively work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He delights to see His children prosper and healthy, even as their soul prospers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This allows us to conclude unquestionably that prolonged sickness is not God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He may temporarily discipline us and cause us to lose our health, but He is not pleased to see us constantly in weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul's word in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 also shows us that prolonged sickness is not God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The condition of the body should match the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If our spirit and soul become sanctified wholly and preserved complete without blame, but our body is still weak, sick, and full of affliction, God will definitely not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His goal is to save man's entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His goal is not just to save certain parts of man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the earthly works of the Lord Jesus reveal God's intention toward the matter of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His only work was to carry out God's will; He had no other work throughout His whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can especially see the heart of the heavenly Father and His attitude toward sickness in the story of the healing of the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The leper said, "Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It seems as if this person was knocking on the door of heaven and asking if healing is God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Matt 8:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is always God's will to heal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a believer thinks that God is not willing to heal him and that he should remain in sickness forever, he does not know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The work of the Lord Jesus on earth was to heal "all those who were ill" v. 16 . We should not think that He has changed His attitude today.</S>
