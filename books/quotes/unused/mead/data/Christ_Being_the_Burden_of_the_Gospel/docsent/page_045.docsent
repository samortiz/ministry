   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLY SPIRIT WITNESSING WITH US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT WE ARE CHILDREN OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, those who believe in Jesus not only have the Bible in their hands but also the Holy Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible is a mysterious book, but the Holy Spirit is even more mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although the Holy Spirit is invisible and intangible, the Holy Spirit is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as we believe in Jesus, the Holy Spirit enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though we may be confused in our mind, we still have a clear sense of the Holy Spirit being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Someone who has believed in the Lord may say, I do not have much feeling that I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we ask him to pray with us, he may begin by praying, Lord, You are my Savior and continue by praying, O Father!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As he calls upon the Lord, an inner sweetness rises up in his being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As he turns to the Father, he even feels like the prodigal son returning to his father in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He feels so sweet, and his tears will start to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more he cries, the more joyful he is within; the more he cries, the more he calls on God as his Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible says, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Acts 2:21; Rom 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without God s life, who would call God his Father?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Who would casually call any person his father if he was not born of that person?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why it is difficult for men to call their wife s father dad, but it is easy to call their own father dad.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We call God our Father when we pray, because we are His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father Gal 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is very sweet when we call Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before I believed in Jesus, I was quite annoyed whenever I heard the name Jesus .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If someone was opposing Jesus, I would immediately stand with him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though I knew many pastors and preachers, I still stood on the side of those who opposed Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After I was saved, I could no longer stand with those who were opposing Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In fact, inwardly, I was standing with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Knowing whether we have truly believed in Jesus is not merely a matter of mental confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, our inward sense tells us that we are in Christ and standing on His side.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If our relatives say, This Jesus cannot be believed, there will be an immediate reaction of disagreement within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what it means to stand on the side of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whoever stands with Jesus in this way has believed in Jesus and has been joined to Jesus because the Spirit of Jesus has entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I once met an elderly man who believed in Jesus very devoutly and prayed to the Lord frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, he dared not say that he was saved, because he had not been taught the truth of salvation clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He thought that since God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble, he should not be bold to say that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was willing to wait until he died in order to find out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although his mind was confused, his spirit was very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit was in him, and he had the peace that comes from being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He even knew that he would be with the Lord when he died.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, he was unwilling to say that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to forget these concepts in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Holy Spirit in our spirit testifies that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have the Bible in our hands, and the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These two witnesses, one within and the other without, are the assurance of our salvation Rom 10:13; 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because we are saved, we do not need to ask about the future.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our future is in God s hands.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>OUR BEING IN CHRIST, HAVING BEEN DELIVERED</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>OUT OF THE REALM OF ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since we are saved and have been joined to the Lord, we are in Christ 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is like being a passenger in a boat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even though the ocean is deep and vast, we can sleep peacefully because we are in the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we should loudly sing, Now I m already in Christ; / I have left Adam s realm; / All old things have become new, / Earthly became heav nly!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>/ Praise the Lord, here I can enjoy grace, / Fully tasting life and peace!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>/ Praise the Lord, I am in the Lord now!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hymns, #229 in Chinese .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are in the boat, in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is so precious.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are not in ourselves or in Adam; we are in God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today we have the Bible in our hands and the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God is in us, and we are in Christ; this is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should boldly proclaim, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am saved, I have the life of God, and God is in me!</S>
