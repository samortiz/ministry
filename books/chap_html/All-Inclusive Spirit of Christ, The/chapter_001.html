<h1 class=title>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</h1><h2 class=head1>I. WHAT IS CHRIST?</h2><p>In order for us to properly understand the all- inclusive Spirit of Christ, we must first see what Christ is. I do not say “who” Christ is, but “what” Christ is. There are many different names given to Christ in the Scriptures; however, we are not going to consider the names of Christ, but the substance of Christ, His very essence. A wooden table may be called a table, but its essence or substance is wood. What is the substance of Christ? This is what I mean by asking “What is Christ?”<h2 class=head2>He Is God</h2><p>I think we all will agree that first of all Christ is God. Let us read Isaiah 9:6. This is a wonderful verse. “For unto us a child is born…and his name shall be called…The mighty God.” How strange that a child could be called “The mighty God”! Yet these two are one! A little child is the mighty God. Can we believe it? This is the difference between the God in whom we believe and the God whom the Hebrew people believe. They believe that God is the only God, the mighty God, but they do not believe that this God has ever been a child. However, here in Isaiah 9:6, the Scripture says a child is called the mighty God. We know this child was Jesus who was born in the manger at Bethlehem. So, Jesus Christ is the very God.<p>John 1:1 tells us clearly and definitely that Christ is God from eternity. Romans 9:5 says that Christ is the God who is over all and blessed forever. With many other verses, the Scripture assures us that the Christ whom we have received as our Savior is God Himself. “In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily” (Col. 2:9).<h2 class=head2>He Is the Father</h2><p>In Isaiah 9:6 there is a parallel line: that is, “unto us a son is given…and his name shall be called…The everlasting Father.” It is abundantly clear that the Son mentioned here is Christ; yet the Son is called, “The everlasting Father.” This statement cannot be easily comprehended; yet it is written. The Son is called the Father; so the Son must be the Father. We must realize this fact. There are some who say that He is called the Father, but He is not really the Father. But how could He be called the Father and yet not be the Father? If I am called a brother, I must be a brother. The Son is called the Father; therefore, He must be the Father. Can we drop Isaiah 9:6 from the Scriptures? It clearly tells not only that a child, the very one born at Bethlehem, is called “The mighty God,” but also that a son given to us is called “The everlasting Father.”<p>In the place where no man can approach Him (1 Tim. 6:16), God is the Father. When He comes forth to manifest Himself, He is the Son. So, a Son is given, yet His name is called “The everlasting Father.” This very Son who has been given to us is the very Father. In John 10:30, the Lord Jesus says, “I and my Father are one.” Please notice that in the King James Version, the word “my” is in italics. This means that it is not in the Greek text. It must be rendered: “I and the Father are one.” They are not two, but one. Then in John 14:8-11 we read: “Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me.” We cannot make the Son and the Father two separate beings, for they are one.<p>Perhaps you may ask how the Son could pray to the Father if the Son is the Father. This is really not much of a problem. Andrew Murray has said that the best prayer is the Christ in us praying to the Christ in heaven. In Zechariah 2:8-11, “the Lord of hosts” is both the Sender and the One sent by Him. The Scripture tells us clearly that the Son is called the Father, and the Son Himself tells us that He and the Father are one.
