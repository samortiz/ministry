        <h2 class="head1">CONSECRATING OUR BODIES AND OUR TIME</h2><p>Among the churches in Nansha, a few brothers have recently had the desire to do some work for the Lord. They had a fellowship meeting in April in Cheluwan. The topic of the meeting was "How to Serve God." As a result, they decided to begin with preaching the gospel and visiting people. In every local church they began to have two or three days of meetings, and the work developed nicely. The most recent message was "Presenting Our Bodies as Living Sacrifices." In every church many brothers and sisters have consecrated their bodies and their time. About seventy have consecrated themselves in Jiazaowan, and many others in Shi-Er-Dai and Dangshanwan. Around forty have consecrated themselves in Wananchiao, and there are thirty in Fengjialou. After consecration, their works are assigned by the church. Those who are able to preach the gospel and visit people are assigned to preaching and visitation. The brothers who cannot preach the gospel or visit are sent to help in the farms and businesses of those brothers who are preaching and visiting. All the churches are joining together in this (we are not separated by locality or region). For example, a brother from Jiazaowan may be sent to help on the farm of a brother in Dangshanwan. Is this way of doing things according to the truth? We are sending this letter particularly to ask for direction in the Lord. We hope you will give us an answer.</p><p>The brothers in Meilinwan: Wang Yu-gen<br />Sinwan: Fei Chang-hua, Sung Da-fu<br />July 12, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: c/o Christian Assembly Hall, Sinwandi, Xiaoshan, Chekiang province</p><p>(Editor: The churches in the region of Nansha are unique in their location. Although there are more than twenty localities, they are all villages in Xiaoshan and Shaoshing counties. Some of the churches mentioned in this letter are only eight or ten li apart. Thus, they spontaneously combine forces and work together. This is not an organization of united churches.)</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCHES PRACTICING<br />TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Thank God that now He is leading a few of us brothers and sisters to pursue life and to learn to serve. We learned something new through a brother's letter and saw something of the work the Lord wants to do in this age. This has enlightened our hearts and given us a way to go on.</p><p>When the lease was up on the old meeting hall in the spring, God led us to build a new meeting hall with eleven rooms. It is large enough for the present use. We still have enough land to build approximately ten more rooms. We have learned deeper lessons through this. God touched the hearts of all the brothers and sisters concerning the matters of service and offerings. They did not merely give according to the measure of their strength, but even beyond their strength. Some brought out their beloved possessions, while others offered up their livelihood. We really saw God working here.</p><p>It is unfortunate, however, that we do not have enough life and are unable to bring more brothers and sisters to rise up and serve God. Some have gotten cold and backslidden, some have gone to love the world, and some have gone into heresy. The biggest problem since the testimony was raised up in Lan-chou involves those who walk according to their own will. Recently, another person quit his job, saying that he was called by God to work for Him. This person works in many places and brings God's children into all kinds of lawlessness and rebellion. We were most troubled about this, but the Lord showed us that God sent Jesus Christ, the Lord sent the twelve apostles, and the Holy Spirit sent out Paul and Barnabas through the church. Therefore, Lan-chou dared not receive these people anymore. We feel that we bear a great responsibility for the church. We are not strong enough. A doctor (the so-called workers) can write the wrong prescription, but the pharmacist (the responsible brothers) cannot give someone the wrong medicine. This responsibility is so great! We really feel that we cannot bear it. We have already stopped the Lord's Day message. May the Lord grace all His children so that the church would learn to preach the gospel. We are temporarily doing some work to prepare the way while we are waiting for God to send His servants to Lan-chou to begin working. There are now more than fifty brothers and sisters in Lan-chou who come to the meetings regularly.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Huang Nai-yang, Si Lu-chen, Ku Zhong-yin</p><p>Mailing Address: 3 Park Road, Lan-chou, Kansu</p><ol class="bullet"><li><a target="_blank" class="text" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/map4.pdf">A Simple Map of the Churches in the Kansu-Sinkiang Region</a></li><li><a target="_blank" class="text" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/table5.pdf">Table of Churches, Responsible Brothers, and Scattered Saints in the Kansu-Sinkiang Region</a></li><li><a target="_blank" class="text" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/map5.pdf">Diagram of the Churches in the Xisha Region of Xiaoshan, Chekiang</a></li><li><a target="_blank" class="text" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/table6.pdf">Table of the Condition of the Christian Assemblies in the Hsisha Region of Hsiaoshan County, Chekiang Province</a></li></ol></p><h2 class="head1">ADDRESSES AND REMARKS</h2><p>The Assembly in Ningwei, c/o Taichanghua Company, Yuzhiatan, Xiaoshan: This was originally a China Inland Mission Church started in 1935. In December of the same year, the brothers came out of the denomination. Then Brother Philip Luan came to preach the gospel for three days, and the meetings officially began. The table began in July of the following year.</p><p>The Assembly in Yinxia, c/o Chen Xian zhong, Post Office Agent, Kanshan Lower Street, Xiaoshan: This assembly began in 1937. They originally met with Ningwei, but because it was too far (more than twenty li), they began meeting and having the table in Brother Chen Bao-chu's home. A three-room meeting hall was built in 1940, and the meetings officially started in the same year.</p><p>The Assembly in Sungxiayuan, c/o Taichanghua Company, Yuzhaitan, Xiaoshan: This assembly began in 1942. They used to meet with Ningwei but later met separately because it was too far to travel to Ningwei (five li). They built a four-room house in this locality and began meeting in May of the same year. The table was established in July.</p><p>The Assembly in Ailientang, address same as above: They used to meet with Ningwei, but because the latter was too far away (more than five li), they built a four-room house in 1945. They began meeting and set up the table here in February 1946.</p><p>The Assembly in Jianjiaoyuan, address same as above: They used to meet with Ningwei, but because the latter was too far away (more than five li), they built a six-room building and began prayer meetings in February 1947. The table began in July of that year.</p><p>Sixingyi Ferry Port, address same as above: In 1946, a flood left sand deposits in Toupeng Village, Dungsha. The inhabitants of the region around Toupeng Village and Sixing Village moved as pioneers to this area. The meetings were held in Brother Chen Da-liang's home. The table was started in the fall of the same year.</p><p>The Assembly in Yingshangwei, c/o Mr. Yu Lian-de, c/o Renshantou Post Office, Xiaoshan: They used to meet with Yingxia, but because there were too many people meeting in a small place, they built a six-room house here and began both the meetings and the table in the spring of 1948.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTERS</h2><p>NATURE: To show the way to serve, to help the serving ones and the churches in the different localities go on, and to solve problems related to the ministry.</p><p>FREQUENCY: Beginning next year, we will publish irregularly.</p><p>PRICES: Beginning next year, we will have no set price. Please send as much as you like. We will gladly receive whatever you send.</p><p>SUBSCRIPTIONS: Beginning next year, we will only send one subscription per person. If you are a new subscriber, you must send us your order personally. We are limiting subscriptions to one per person. We apologize for not being able to send extra copies for you to give away.</p><p>ATTENTION: 1) When subscribing, please write neatly and make sure the address is clear. 2) When changing your address, your name must be the same as when you first subscribed. It is best if you can also send us the code number from the wrapper of your copy.</p><p>WIRING MONEY: Please wire money to Gospel Book Room Shipping Department, 18 Lane 240 Tong Ren Road (23) Shanghai. If you are wiring money through the post office, you will need to write our branch name. Please mark it: Jingan Temple.</p><h2 class="head1">PUBLICATION ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>1) Some churches in certain localities have asked us to send a number of copies to them (without listing the names and addresses of individual brothers and sisters). If you want to receive the same number of copies next year, please send the names and addresses of those brothers and sisters that we may file them individually.</p><p>2) It takes much time to answer letters. When we feel that certain letters do not need an answer, we will not answer them. Please forgive us for this.</p><p>3) Each issue is sent out as they are available. Later subscribers will only be sent issues left in stock.</p><p>4) The mail routes are erratic in certain localities. We will send out all that we are able to send. For those places that cannot receive our mail, we will send out the subscriptions whenever the routes become available again.</p><h2 class="head1">GOSPEL HYMNALS</h2><p>Our first printing is sold out. Those whose orders came too late must wait until the next reprint. Because labor and material costs have risen, each hymnal in the second printing will temporarily cost five gold yen. (Those who paid in October will be charged the same price as the first printing.)</p><p>Gospel Book Room<br />P. O. Box 5008, Shanghai<br />November 11, 1948</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
