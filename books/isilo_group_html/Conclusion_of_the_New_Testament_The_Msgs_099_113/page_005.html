To Perish with the Devil in the Lake of Fire</h2><p>Eventually, the children of the Devil will perish with the Devil in the lake of fire. Revelation 20:10 says that the Devil &#8220;was cast into the lake of fire,&#8221; and verse 15 says that those not found written in the book of life are likewise cast into the lake of fire. Thus, the destination of the children of the Devil is to perish with the Devil.<h2 class=head2>5. Enemies of God</h2><p>Those who are sinners, sons of disobedience, children of wrath, and children of the Devil surely are enemies of God. Being an enemy of God is even more serious than being a sinner. Enmity is the greatest problem between man and God. Before we were saved we were God&#8217;s enemies (Rom. 5:10).<h2 class=head3>a. In Their Mind</h2><p>Colossians 1:21 says that we once were enemies in our mind by evil works. Our enmity toward God was mainly in our corrupted mind.<h2 class=head3>b. By Evil Works</h2><p>According to Colossians 1:21, we were enemies in our mind and by our evil works. We were rebellious against God and thereby were God&#8217;s enemies. Because we were sinners we needed redemption. Because we were also enemies to God we needed reconciliation.<h2 class=head2>6. Sons of Gehenna</h2><p>Finally, before we were saved we were sons of Gehenna. The Lord Jesus uses the expression &#8220;the son of Gehenna&#8221; in Matthew 23:15. &#8220;Gehenna&#8221; is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew Ge Hinnom, valley of Hinnom. This was a deep and narrow valley near Jerusalem, the refuse-place of the city where the bodies of criminals and all kinds of filth were cast. It was also called Tophet, or Topheth (2 Kings 23:10; Isa. 30:33; Jer. 19:13). Because of its continual fire, it became the symbol of the place of eternal punishment, the lake of fire.<p>All sinners, who are sons of disobedience, children of wrath, children of the Devil, and enemies of God, are also sons of Gehenna. Using today&#8217;s term, they are sons of hell. For unbelievers to be sons of Gehenna means that they will go to Gehenna, to the lake of fire. Our status before we were saved was that of sinners, sons of disobedience, children of wrath, children of the Devil, enemies of God, and sons of Gehenna.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 099-113) &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
