   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John said, "Young children, it is the last hour" 1 John 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How strange this word is to man!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Was this not written during only the first few pages of the history of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Was this not the period of the infancy of the holy religion?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I imagine when the apostle John wrote this, he could still remember the glorious state of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The evangelical works around him seemed to be advancing undeterred.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the Spirit of God said through him, "It is the last hour" because "many antichrists have come."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Peter spoke the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said, "But there arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And many will follow their licentiousness, because of whom the way of the truth will be reviled" 2 Pet 2:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This warning soon became a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jude said also, "For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who of old have been written of beforehand for this judgment, ungodly men, perverting the grace of our God into licentiousness and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ" Jude 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, there is the need to "contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints" Jude 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul's testimony was even more clear.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He told the elders in Ephesus: "I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them" Acts 20:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not long after, this word also became a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Paul was about to depart from the world, he sent a letter to Timothy saying, "This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me" 2 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was Asia, but what about Europe?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The end was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From Rome Paul sent a letter to the Philippians saying, "For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ" Phil 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"For all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus" 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Concerning the condition of the church then, Paul did not say any appeasing words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said, "But evil men and imposters will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived" 2 Tim 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money,...lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power" 3:1-2, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"For the time will come when they will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears, and they will turn away their ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths" 4:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have seen the testimonies of the apostles which speak of the condition of the churches then.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After we read these words, we will realize how the Gentiles in the east and in the west had both failed and had come short of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God had warned the Gentiles through Paul: "For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Behold then the kindness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity;...if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off" Rom 11:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even when the apostles were still alive, the Gentiles were already not continuing in God's kindness!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Did God break them off?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the crucial question.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 expressed God's view concerning the Gentile churches who did not continue in His kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although these seven epistles contain words of warning, promise, and encouragement, the most prominent feature is their judgmental nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was God's final warning to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was the precursor to the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After reading these seven epistles, one can see that insofar as His plan is concerned, God has forsaken His church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the church in Laodicea, the Lord was driven outside the door already.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has rejected the church organization.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can see this from the words on God's gifts: "God has placed some in the church: first apostles..." and "He Himself gave some as apostles..."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>1 Cor 12:28; Eph 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The most important gift and ministry in the church are the apostles, but where are the apostles now?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Roman Catholic Church considers the pope as the successor of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we know that the "apostolic succession" is a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to admit that there are no more apostles now.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why is God not giving apostles to the church anymore?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To this I must answer: because God has rejected the church and her organization.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This being the case, what is the age from the time of the churches in Revelation until now?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the old days, God dispersed the Jews all over the world because of their sins, but He still tolerated them again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the same way, although God has rejected the church, in His kindness He still treats the Gentiles with endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God desires all men to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, He endures until now.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, we have to know that now, that is, from the time of God's rejection of the church until today, we are in a special period.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God's intention at the present time is not to establish the organized church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If it were, He would have given apostles to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The fact that He has not given apostles to the church shows that God's intention is not for the organized church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's intention is to gain more people from the Gentiles unto His name.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"What you see write in a scroll."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If Revelation had been handed down to us through oral communication, one wonders how much would be retained until today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God considers this book important.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, He would see to it that it be written down.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What God considers worthy of writing, we should consider worthy of reading.</S>
