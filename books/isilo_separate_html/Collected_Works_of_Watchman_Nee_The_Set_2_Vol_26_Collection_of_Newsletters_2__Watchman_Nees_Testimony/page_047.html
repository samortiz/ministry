I had already sent a letter on the eighth with Brother Yi Sheng's letter. I sent a letter one day and received yours the next day. Thank and praise our Lord. When I read your letter, it filled my heart with happiness because you and Brother Ma are going to come back soon and because Brother Nee is somewhat better and can go out on the street. I really thank the Lord for this. Although we are not sure when he will be able to come to Manchuria, we do not cease in our prayers. If God wants him to come, he will come. If God does not tell him to come, it would be useless for him to come anyway. We can only pray quietly and wait for God's time. We believe that the lambs without a shepherd here will be cared for by the Lord Himself who is able to send a faithful servant to feed them.</p><p>Satan is formally opposing us through those in the denominations. (Parts omitted.)</p><p>There were twenty-four people in yesterday's Bible-study meeting (Thursday); among them was a deacon from the denominations. We allow anyone from the denominations who wants to attend to come to this meeting. We pay particular attention to the prayer meeting and the table meeting. We are all well here. Please do not worry about us. May you have peace in the Lord! Please greet the brothers and sisters there for me!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Hua Su Sheng<br />January 11, 1935</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM CH'ANG-CH'UN, MANCHURIA</h2><p>Peace to Brother Shun T'ien who walks together with me in the way in the Lord:</p><p>Thank the Lord, He truly and especially loves us; He has led us to walk in the way today. May we all walk in the Lord's will, amen. I went to Chu Chia Cheng Tze a few days ago to visit the brothers and sisters there. I stayed there for four days. Brother An K'o Pai is doing pretty well, but he is very troubled and tempted by the devil. There is a certain man there who uses all kinds of persuasive methods and has drawn several brothers away from our fellowship. Thank God, He is still enlightening them, and a few have already returned. We gave them completely to the Lord and asked Him to take care of them. I came back and stayed two or three days and then returned to Kirin. Brother Luke Kuo and Brother Hua Su Sheng sent a letter asking me to go to them quickly because they had something to discuss with me. Kirin began the Lord's table to remember the Lord on January 6, the first Lord's Day of this year. Fourteen brothers and sisters came that evening. Later, I spoke a little concerning the truth of the table meeting and the responsibility we should bear. Six brothers and two sisters eventually partook of the bread. Thank God, their condition is very good, but there is no one to cultivate them. This is a great need at present. It is the same in Ch'ang-ch'un. (Parts omitted.)</p><p>I heard that Brother Nee's illness was somewhat better. When will he come to Manchuria? We will give it to God. That is God's business. We only have to bear the responsibility to pray. May you have peace! Greet all the brothers and sisters in Shanghai!</p><p>Your brother,<br />T'ien P'ing Fang</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> </body></html>
