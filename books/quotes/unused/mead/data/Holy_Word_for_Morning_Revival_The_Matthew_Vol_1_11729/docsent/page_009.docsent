   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 2 DAY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 1:18, 20-21</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>18 Now the origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, after she had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child 1 of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>20 But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been 1 begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>21 And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name 1 Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>18 1 Lit., out of.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although Christ was born of Mary v. 16 , He was a child of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The birth of Christ was directly of the Holy Spirit v. 20 . His source was the Holy Spirit and His element was divine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the virgin Mary He put on flesh and blood, the human nature, taking the likeness of the flesh Rom 8:3 , the likeness of men Phil 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>20 1 God was first born into Mary through His Spirit; after the conception was completed, He, with the human nature, was born to be a God-man, possessing both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the origin of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>21 1 Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua Num 13:16 , which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, Jesus is not only a man but Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, He is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is also our Joshua, the One who brings us into rest Heb 4:8; Matt 11:28-29 , which is Himself as the good land to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The birth of Christ was prepared and carried out by God's sovereignty 1:8; Luke 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the forefathers of Joseph and Mary had remained in Babylon how could Jesus have been born in Bethlehem?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we can see God's sovereignty in bringing back the ancestors of both Joseph and Mary Matt 1:12; Ezra 5:1-2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By His sovereignty, God placed both Joseph and Mary in the same city, Nazareth Luke 1:26; 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even more, by His sovereignty, God brought Joseph and Mary together in marriage to bring forth Christ to be the legal heir to the throne of David.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Luke 1:26-38, the birth of Christ was carried out through Mary's surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was not easy for a young virgin like Mary to accept the commission to conceive a child.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mary might have said, "Gabriel, don't you know that I am espoused to a man already?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can I conceive a child?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After listening to the angel, Mary said, "Behold the slave of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May it happen to me according to your word" Luke 1:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To bring forth Christ Mary paid a very high price the cost of her whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, Mary's surrender was not directly related to the conceiving of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The conceiving of Jesus was directly related to the Holy Spirit Matt 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our surrender means little; it simply affords the opportunity for the Holy Spirit's power to come into us and accomplish something.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although there was the sovereignty of God, the surrender of Mary, and the power of the Holy Spirit, there was the need of Joseph's obedience and coordination Matt 1:19-21, 24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What would have happened if Joseph had insisted on a divorce?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because at that time Joseph was a young man, I would take this opportunity to say a word to the young people: Do not make decisions too fast or act too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Be a little slow and give the Lord a chance to come in. To take such a woman would surely be a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, Joseph also paid a price.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The bringing forth of Christ cost him a great deal, for it caused him to suffer shame.</S>
