   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROOF OF GOD S SELECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I do not wish to enter into the theological debate concerning man s responsibility in relation to God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I simply desire to emphasize the fact of God s selection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all have become Christians because of this selection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many of us do not even know why we became Christians in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some of us may even have tried to stop believing in the Lord, but we were not successful in doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, it is wonderful to be a Christian; but on the other hand, it is extremely trying and difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We Christians are not only Jacobs, but also Jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Due to God s selection, we had no choice except to become Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now that we have believed into the Lord Jesus, we simply cannot escape from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This proves that we have been selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Within us there is something that causes us to believe in the Lord, whether we want to believe in Him or not.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This comes from the selection of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may want to get a divorce from the Lord, but He refuses to sign the certificate of divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is not afraid of any attempt we might make to escape from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He knows that however hard we may try, we cannot get away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the strongest proof that we have been selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How marvelous is the divine selection of grace!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>GOD S SELECTION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>AND THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We see God s selection in a practical way in our preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A number of unbelievers may attend the same meeting and hear the same message; however, only certain ones respond.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is difficult to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can attribute it only to God s selection, predestination, and calling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I remember a story told about D. L. Moody.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One day a student expressed the concern that through his preaching of the gospel someone could be saved who had not been selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moody told him not to be troubled, but to simply continue to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, Moody said that he should allow anyone who is willing to believe to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moody went on to say that over the entrance of heaven there will be written the words, Whosoever will may come, but that after a person passes through the entrance, he will see inscribed upon the inside of it these words: Chosen from before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>ALL A MATTER OF GOD S MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we would properly serve God in the gospel of His Son, we must know that the gospel includes the selection of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The gospel is wholly a matter of God s sovereign mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many years ago, I had some realization of this, but my realization is much stronger today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through many years of experience, I have become strongly and deeply convinced that everything that happens to us is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All is a matter of God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we see this, the more we shall spontaneously bear our responsibility before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, even the bearing of responsibility is of God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why is it that some believers are willing to bear their responsibility and that others are not?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The answer lies in God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 9:15 Paul quotes the Lord s words, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of God s mercy in His selection of grace, we responded to the gospel when others did not respond; we received a word about Christ as our life when others refused to receive it; and we took the way of the Lord s recovery today when others drew back from taking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some can testify that although they are in the Lord s recovery today, those who brought them to this way did not come this way themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Regarding His recovery, God has mercy on whom He will have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not in the Lord s recovery because we are more intelligent than others or because we seek the Lord more than others do.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our being here is altogether due to the mercy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you consider how the Lord brought you into the church life in the Lord s recovery, you will worship Him for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I believe that we in the Lord s recovery are among the remnant according to the selection of grace 11:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Regarding the gospel, the ministry of life, and the church life in the Lord s recovery, God has had mercy upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How we must praise Him for His sovereign mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should have no trust in ourselves, and we should not think we are here because of anything that we are or that we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our being in the Lord s recovery today is not of our willing nor of our running, but of God, the One who shows mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What a mercy that we are saved and that we are willing to take the Lord s way!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, it is a mercy that we are willing to be separated from today s evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The world is both attractive and attracting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nevertheless, I can testify that I simply have no appetite for the things of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am covered with a kind of divine insulation, an insulation that keeps me from the world system.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is another aspect of God s mercy.</S>
