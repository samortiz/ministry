   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE SERVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Serving the Lord and preaching the gospel are related.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once a person is saved, he should preach the gospel and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every normal Christian preaches the gospel and serves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, the more a Christian receives grace, the more he will receive the Lord s leading and dealing and the more he will be able to serve the Lord in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE MOTIVE FOR SERVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I love my master;...I will not go out free Exo 21:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Believers do not serve the Lord because of outward encouragement or pressure from man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We serve the Lord out of the inward motivation of our love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our love for the Lord inwardly compels us to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It urges us to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our love for the Lord makes us unable not to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We love the Lord, so we must serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is typified in the Old Testament by the slave who loved his master.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the slave could have been free and did not need to continue to serve as a slave, he did not want to go out free because of his love for his master.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He willingly remained as a slave to serve the master whom he loved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is our motive in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We become His servants and serve Him willingly because of our love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our service to the Lord comes out of our love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice...which is your reasonable service Rom 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We love the Lord because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord s love moves us and encourages us to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord s love for us produces our love for Him, making it impossible for us not to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the Lord s love causes us to love Him and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason Paul exhorted the believers through the compassions of God to present their bodies a living sacrifice in service to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The compassions of God, the love of God, encourage us to love Him and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We serve Him because His love encourages us and stirs up a love within us for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This deep love is our motivation to serve Him, and it makes it impossible for us not to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE MEANING OF SERVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Enslaved to God ; Christ s slave Rom 6:22; 1 Cor 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To serve the Lord is to be the Lord s slave.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word slave is not a very pleasant expression when it is applied to unbelievers in the world, because it often denotes an inferior status.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the word slave is a felicitous and glorious expression when it is applied to believers because we are serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be a slave of the Lord is a glorious matter!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be a slave is the status of those who serve the Lord and the meaning of serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Serving the Lord is not about doing a great work before men; it is about being a slave before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Live to the Lord Rom 14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since serving the Lord is a matter of being a slave, it is also a matter of living to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The entire being of one who truly serves the Lord is to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His whole living, his entire life, is to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, service is a matter of one s entire living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The call to serve the Lord is not limited to full-time workers and preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With the Lord s leading, it is possible to serve the Lord by maintaining respectable works in any career Titus 3:8, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Colossians 3:22-24 shows that actual slaves were serving the Lord when they served according to the Lord s will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No matter what our career or job may be, we can serve the Lord as long as it is according to the Lord s will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not the Lord s intention that every Christian would leave his job or career to be a full-time preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord s will is for every one of us to serve Him, but serving Him does not necessarily mean we must become a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It only means that we live to Him in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are many preachers today who do not necessarily live to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Similarly, there are many believers who love the Lord and truly live to Him, even though they have a career or job.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They may not be preachers, but they are truly serving the Lord by living to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the Bible, we are not called to make a profession out of preaching; rather, we are called to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is our career.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Any career or job that we have is a secondary matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our principal occupation is to serve the Lord; serving the Lord comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our goal for living on the earth is to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should make serving the Lord the center and goal of our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The only reason that we have a career or a job is to make a living and to supply the needs of the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We also can contact people through our careers and jobs to preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No career or job is more important than serving the Lord and preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should consider our occupation only as something that we do on the side.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our focus should be on serving the Lord and preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Regardless of whether we are doctors, teachers, businessmen, or laborers, our career or job should be for serving the Lord and preaching the gospel.</S>

   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Each of us should consider serving the Lord and preaching the gospel as our primary occupation and our careers and jobs as secondary occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the living of a normal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the only way to live to the Lord and to serve Him.</S>
