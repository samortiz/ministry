<h2 class="head4">The Categories of Materials</h2>
<p>According to the record in the Old Testament, the principal building materials for the temple were timber and stone; in addition, there were gold, silver, and bronze.</p>
<h2 class="head5">Timber</h2>
<p>First Kings 5 and 6 show that two kinds of timber were used to build the temple: cedar and cypress (5:6, 8-10; 6:9, 15-20, 34).</p>
<h2 class="head6">Cedar</h2>
<p>The cedar used for the building of the temple came from tall trees grown in the mountains of Lebanon (5:6). In the Old Testament times cedar was a valuable timber. In the temple all the places where timber could be seen were made of cedar. Cedar denotes resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head6">Cypress</h2>
<p>The term <em>pine tree</em> mentioned in the Chinese Union Version is better translated as &ldquo;cypress tree.&rdquo; In ancient China, people planted cypress trees at gravesites because an evergreen cypress symbolizes everlasting life. In biblical typology cypress trees signify death. The acacia wood in the furniturea nd utensils of the tabernacle signify humanity, cypress signifies humanity in death, and cedar signifies humanity in resurrection. The two kinds of timber used in the temple&mdash;cypress and cedar&mdash;signify death and resurrection.</p>
<p>The tabernacle was constructed mostly of gold and wood. Gold signifies divinity, and wood signifies humanity. This means that the church is the mingling of God and man. The principle of the mingling of God and man is also seen in the building of the temple, where the aspect of wood is quite important. This shows that in the church the human element is very important. As far as our natural being is concerned, the church is not composed of natural persons, but as far as our resurrected being is concerned, the church is full of the human element. If the church were not composed of men, it would have no material and could not be established and built up. The church can be compared to the temple in ancient Israel. Most of the materials were cypress and cedar, signifying persons who have died and resurrected. The church is not composed of natural persons but of persons who have passed through death and entered into resurrection, that is, persons who are as cypress and cedar.</p>
<p>When I began to serve the Lord, I did not know what it meant to experience death and resurrection in the matter of serving God, nor did I know the experience of death and resurrection in the church. Although I was clear about these matters doctrinally, I did not have any subjective experience. I believe that many people are in this situation. After years of experience, however, I have gained a deep understanding concerning this matter. For example, some saints are truly talented. When we contact them, it is easy to think that they could be very useful in the church. Saints will also frequently suggest that a certain person could be very useful in the church because he has run a business, operated a factory, participated in education, or accomplished some great matter. This kind of speaking may seem correct, but if we have experience and light, we will realize that this concept is natural and questionable.</p>
<p>Although the basic building material for the church is humanity, it must not be natural humanity. In the temple there was no timber besides cedar and cypress. Man&rsquo;s natural ability can never be brought into the church or become building material for the church. In the church there is nothing natural. Whenever people try to bring their natural abilities into the church, the reality of the church is lost. Only that which passes through death and resurrection can be brought into the church.</p>
<p>How can we differentiate natural ability from ability that has passed through death and resurrection? There is a great difference between the two. In this regard, we do not need to speak doctrinally; instead, we must know this matter according to experience. First, all natural ability contains pride; everything that we can do naturally causes us to be proud. Hence, anything that we do in the church which causes us to be proud is natural. If a brother cleans the windows in the meeting hall nicely and thinks that he has done the best job, he has a problem. His thought proves that he is still natural.</p>
<p>Paul boasted in the book of 1 Corinthians, but there was no pride in his boast. He was forced by the Corinthians to boast, but it was not expedient for him to do so. His boast was in resurrection, in spirit (cf. ch. 9). When we read 1 Corinthians, we sense that Paul was a person whose speech was straightforward, whose spirit was clean, and whose flesh had been crucified. In other words, in 1 Corinthians Paul was pure. If our boasting gives people a feeling that we are impure and fleshly, we are still natural.</p>
<p>Second, natural ability causes self-reliance. To rely on ourselves means to have confidence in ourselves. If we sense that we are secure and trustworthy in the matter of serving God and if we are full of confidence that everything put into our hand will be successful, we still have the natural element. Everything that comes out of the natural man, just as everything that issues from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, causes us to have much confidence in ourselves and not to depend on God. Everything that passes through death and resurrection, just as everything that issues from the tree of life, causes us not to depend on ourselves and not to have confidence in ourselves but rather to depend on God.</p>
<p>Third, natural ability is temporary and unable to withstand tests, setbacks, or opposition. If we serve in the church by our natural ability, we will stop as soon as the saints criticize us and be discouraged after the elders have dealt with us. If something can cause us not to complete our service or can discourage us, our service is quite natural. Everything that passes through death and resurrection is able to endure and withstand opposition, criticism, and setbacks. It is able to stand firm in the midst of a test.</p>
<p>Fourth, those who serve according to natural ability desire rewards or, at least, appreciation from others. Some brothers and sisters require people&rsquo;s gratitude, exaltation, and appreciation for their service in the church; this is to seek a reward. After doing a certain thing, they hope the responsible brothers will appreciate and praise them. They seek to receive a reward. If the responsible brothers ignore their service, they become cold and backslide. If they receive a compliment, however, they are excited and seek to do even better. This proves that they are still serving God in the natural man.</p>
<p>Fifth, natural ability likes to manifest itself, to be known by man, and to be carried out in front of man. The five preceding points are a gauge and a check as to whether a saint is still living in the natural man or has passed through death and resurrection.</p>
<p>Those who have passed through death and resurrection are not proud and do not have a consciousness of success. Although they may have done many things well, they do not consider that they have done something special. In Matthew 25 the Lord commended the sheep, saying, &ldquo;I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me a drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in, naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me&rdquo; (vv. 35-36). In response, the sheep asked, &ldquo;Lord, when have we seen You hungry and have fed You, or thirsty and have given You a drink? And when have we seen You a stranger and have taken You in, or naked and have clothed You?&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). Their response indicates that they were not conscious of doing those things. This is similar to a healthy person who is not conscious of breathing even though he is breathing constantly. A person in resurrection may do many things, but he is not conscious of doing those things.</p>
<p>If a person is immediately conscious of what he has done and desires others&rsquo; appreciation, he is not right. If a brother is full of feeling when he offers material things for the Lord&rsquo;s work, his offering certainly contains a natural element. If his giving is in resurrection, he will not have any feeling, even if he gives half of his possessions. In matters such as helping the brothers and sisters or giving hospitality, we will be very conscious of our actions if we are in our natural man, but if we are in resurrection, we will not have any consciousness. Whatever passes through death and resurrection comes out of life, and what comes out of life is spontaneous, without any special feeling. For instance, when our body is healthy and normal, we are not conscious of our blood&rsquo;s circulation and our stomach&rsquo;s digestion. Thus, if we inwardly have a sense of accomplishment after doing a certain thing or fulfilling a task, we are still in our natural man.</p>
<p>Everything that comes out of resurrection is able to endure and to withstand any blow. The Lord said in John 2:19, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; This is resurrection. Resurrection is the ability to rise up in the midst of any setback. When Peter was preaching concerning the Lord in Acts 2:24, he said that it was not possible for Him to be held by death. The Lord resurrected because He could not be held by death. Resurrection cannot be constrained, bound, or oppressed. Instead, the more the oppression and death it experiences, the more it grows. The more the opposition, the stronger it becomes; the more there is criticism, the more living it becomes; and the more it is despised, the more it multiplies.</p>
<p>Whatever issues from resurrection does not need a reward, and what comes out of life is not affected by criticism. A person such as this, in both the work and service of the church, has passed through death and resurrection. Such a person never thinks of other people&rsquo;s assessment of him and does not expect any appreciation or reward from man. He labors according to an inward sense of peace and joy, not caring for outward things. On the contrary, a natural person serves more fervently if he is commended, because compliments touch him; however, he withdraws when others are cold toward him, because he is touched by the coldness. Some people will not pray a second time if no one says Amen to their first prayer, yet if many people say Amen to their prayer, they will pray even louder. The Amen is their reward, but this indicates that they are living in the natural man. A person who has passed through death and resurrection cannot be touched by people&rsquo;s appreciation or indifference.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whatever is of resurrection is hidden. Even if it is done in public, it is still hidden. No one living in resurrection likes to show off. Only fleshly ones like to show off. In the church there cannot be any who are natural; rather, everyone must experience death and resurrection. In our service we should not see only ability but also cypress and cedar, that is, death and resurrection. Today the situation of many Christians is pitiful. In the matter of material offering, there are donation records, showing who has donated the most. This kind of donation is for self-boasting. This is not cypress and cedar. It is altogether natural and has not passed through death and resurrection.</p>
<p>The fact that the temple was only cypress and cedar timber indicates that the materials for building the church must pass through death and resurrection. In the elders&rsquo; room, the deacons&rsquo; office, and the bookroom, there should be only cypress and cedar. Anything natural should not be brought into the church. The church is not strong, because there is a mixture of many kinds of wood instead of only cypress and cedar. The type of the building of the temple shows that there should be only cypress and cedar in the church, not any other kind of wood. The material of the church is composed only of what has passed through death and resurrection.</p>
