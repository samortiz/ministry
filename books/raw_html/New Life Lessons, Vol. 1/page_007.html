 <h1 class="msg">MEETING</h1>
<h2 class="head2">MEETING IS THE LIFE PULSE<br />
OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND<br />
THE CENTER OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETING</h2>
<p>1. MEETING IS THE LORD&rsquo;S COMMAND</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another.&rdquo;</strong> Hebrews 10:25</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together&rdquo; is the Bible&rsquo;s command, as well as God&rsquo;s command to His children.</p>
<p>If we cease <strong>meeting</strong> together, we interrupt the <strong>church life,</strong> because our meeting life is the church life. Meeting is to a Christian as water is to a fish, air to a bird, and breathing to a man.</p>
<p>2. MEETING IS THE CHARACTERISTIC<br />
OF CHRISTIANS</p>
<p>Christians, like sheep and bees,<br />
like to flock together.<br />
Since meeting is a demand of our inner life,<br />
it must be our way of living.</p>
<p>For this reason, not only must we meet often, but we must meet to such an extent that it becomes a habit, thus producing a <strong>meeting life.</strong></p>
<p>It is like the need to eat and drink daily in the human life.</p>
<p>3. RECEIVING THE CORPORATE GRACE IN THE MEETINGS</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s grace to man is twofold:</p>
<p class="indent1">The individual side&mdash;through one&rsquo;s own reading of the Bible, praying, seeking, and fellowshipping with God.</p>
<p class="indent1">The corporate side&mdash;through meeting together.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>(1) Bible reading: The light we receive when we read the Bible by ourselves is limited, but in the meetings it is abundant.</p>
<p>(2) Prayer: Many matters that cannot be solved by individual prayers are readily solved by corporate prayers.</p>
<p>(3) Spiritual problems: Weaknesses and problems that are insurmountable individually are taken care of many times in the meetings.</p>
<p>(4) The Lord&rsquo;s presence: It was during a meeting that the Lord appeared to the disciples on the night of His resurrection.</p>
<p>All these blessings are given to us by the Lord in the meetings and only in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE KINDS OF MEETINGS</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 2:42</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house...&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 2:46</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 5:42</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 20:20</p>
<p>The New Testament shows us that there are two kinds of church meetings, each having its function:</p>
<p>1. <strong>The big meetings:</strong> educational, as in a school</p>
<p>(1) Releasing the truth, supplying life</p>
<p>(2) Expounding the Bible, teaching the truths</p>
<p>Goal: That all the saints may know the truths and may live in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy</p>
<p>2. <strong>The home meetings:</strong> Home nurturing, as in a family</p>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>(1) Continuing in the apostles&rsquo; teaching and fellowship</p>
<p>(2) Breaking bread to remember the Lord</p>
<p>(3) Praying&mdash;calling on the Lord</p>
<p>(4) Preaching the gospel</p>
<p>(5) Speaking the truth</p>
<p>Functions:</p>
<p>(1) Upholding the saints&mdash;shepherding and caring for them</p>
<p>(2) Recovering the ones who have not been coming to the meetings&mdash;seeking and contacting them</p>
<p>(3) Bringing in the new ones&mdash;preaching the gospel to relatives, friends, and neighbors</p>
<p>Thus we can see that the home meetings are <strong>the foundation of the building of the church.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The heaven and the earth may pass away, but the home meetings must not be forsaken.</strong></p>
