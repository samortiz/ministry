   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"The eyes of your heart" are the faculty of our reasoning, the faculty of understanding, which is our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this section of the Scripture, the word "know" or "knowledge" has been mentioned twice.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These two "knowings" have different meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first knowing is the knowing in the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second knowing is the knowing or realization of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spirit of revelation is the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God reveals Himself in our spirit in order that we may have the full knowledge of Him through the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this knowledge is just in the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is only in our inner man; our outer man still does not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is essential for the inner man to convey what it knows to the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Otherwise, the outer man will not know what the inner man is asking for and will not take the same action.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How is this conveying done?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Scripture tells us that our spirit needs to enlighten our mind, so that our mind can understand the notion of our spirit and our outer man can also have the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our outer man apprehends things through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why the spirit's knowledge through the intuition must be conveyed to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The mind in turns tells the whole body and causes it to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We receive the will of God in our intuition first, then our mind enables us to know that it is God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Holy Spirit impresses our spirit and gives us a spiritual sense.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we apply our mind to study and understand this sense.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to comprehend fully the will of God, there must be a co-working of the spirit and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spirit causes our inner man to have the knowledge, while the mind causes our outer man to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This cooperation of the spirit with the mind causes the believers to fully know the will of God, and it happens in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It may takes us a long time to describe it in words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in actuality, the two things are like the right and left hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As soon as an assignment comes, the spirit knows it in the twinkling of an eye and causes the mind to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, all revelations come from the Holy Spirit and reach man's spirit not his mind .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man's spirit knows or receives God's revelation through his intuition, but he studies the meaning of the intuition of the spirit through the mind and then understands it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not allow our mind to be the primary faculty of receiving God's revelation, but we also should not prevent our mind from being the secondary faculty to understand His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A fleshly believer has not learned to walk according to the spirit and, therefore, must use the thoughts within his mind to be the rule for his walk.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A spiritual believer should walk according to the spirit; but he should not negate the mind with its understanding of the intentions of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In genuine guidance, the spirit and the mind are in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no such thing as the reasoning in the mind going against the leading in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The leading of the spirit may be opposite of the so-called rationale of the ordinary mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a believer, who has the leading in the spirit, understands God's will through the co-working of his mind and spirit, his rationale will agree that the leading in the spirit is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, we are talking about believers whose minds have been renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But before the spirit of a believer has reached the highest position, the mind is usually against the leading of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Ephesians 1:17-18 we see how the spirit assists the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The spirit first receives the revelation from the Holy Spirit and then enlightens the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the mind of a spiritual man does not live by the natural life, it has to live by the enlightening of the spirit; otherwise, it will fall into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The renewed mind requires the light of the spirit for its guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, when the spirit of a believer is blocked by evil spirits, he will sense that the path of his thoughts are darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His thoughts will be confused, his mind will be disorganized, and his whole being will be unable to concentrate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The mental power of a believer comes from the spirit, and when the spirit is locked up, power will not reach the mind, and the mind will seem to lose its direction.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, if we want to keep our spirit and mind properly related, we have to be watchful and not allow our spirit to be surrounded by evil spirits, in order that our mind can function normally.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The believer's mind is the outlet of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We know that the Holy Spirit is living in the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But have we ever thought about how the Holy Spirit expresses Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Holy Spirit is not satisfied with believers just sensing or believing that He is in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His goal is to express Himself through man so that others may gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In addition, the Spirit also has hundreds and thousands of things that need to be done through man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not sufficient just to have the Holy Spirit living in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He must be expressed through the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The mind expresses the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the mind is blocked, the spirit cannot be opened, and the Holy Spirit will not be able to flow from our spirit to others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need the mind to "interpret" the notions of our intuition so that the Holy Spirit can express His intention through us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If our mind is narrow and foolish, the Holy Spirit will not be able to fellowship with the believer according to His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to be careful not to lock up the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
