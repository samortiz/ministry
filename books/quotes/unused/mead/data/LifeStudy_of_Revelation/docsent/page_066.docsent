   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH S CONDITION A. Having a Little Power</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 3:8 we see the condition of the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Firstly, this church had a little power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many times we estimate the church in Philadelphia too highly, thinking that this church was strong and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, it was not so.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may think that when the Lord raised up the brothers in England one hundred fifty years ago, every one of them must have been like David.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While we estimate the church in Philadelphia very highly, the Lord says that she had a little power.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What pleases the Lord is not that we are strong, but that we use our little power to do the best we can.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not try to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The strong ones may not please the Lord as much as those who do their best with the little power they have.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You can never surpass what the Lord gives you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Simply spend what you have received from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not usurp the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>None among us can say that he has received nothing from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even the least among us has received a certain amount of grace from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You must spend that grace, using it to do your best.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you do this, the Lord will appreciate you and say, Good.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have a little power, yet you have kept My word with the power you have.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not seek to be a giant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord is not happy with giants; He is happy with the little ones who have an amount of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although that grace may be limited in its capacity, as long as we use it, spending it to do as much as we can to keep the Lord s word, He will be pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. Having Kept the Lord s Word</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 8 the Lord said that the church in Philadelphia kept His word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One outstanding feature of Philadelphia is that she kept the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to history, no other Christians have kept the Lord s word as strictly as these in the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, by His grace, we are keeping His word today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although many condemn us, saying that we are heretical, among today s Christians no one regards the Lord s word more than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We keep the Word of God, not in the traditional way, but in the way of the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This offends those who want to hold the traditions of their forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church in Philadelphia does not care for tradition; she cares for the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. Having Not Denied the Lord s Name</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 8 the Lord also said that the church in Philadelphia did not deny His name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since the brothers were raised up in England in the early part of the eighteenth century, they have not taken any name other than the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word is the Lord s expression, and the name is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The apostate church has deviated from the Lord s word and become heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reformed church, though recovered to the Lord s word to some extent, has denied the Lord s name by denominating herself with many other names, such as Lutheran, Wesleyan, Anglican, Presbyterian, and Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The recovered church has not only returned to the Lord s word in a full way, but has also abandoned all names other than that of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The recovered church belongs to the Lord absolutely, having nothing to do with any denominations any names .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To deviate from the Lord s Word is apostasy, and to denominate the church with any name other than the Lord s is spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church as the chaste virgin espoused to Christ 2 Cor 11:2 should not have any name other than her husband s. All other names are an abomination in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the recovered church life we have no teachings of Balaam 2:14 , no teachings of the Nicolaitans 2:15 , no teachings of Jezebel 2:20 , and no mysterious doctrines of Satan 2:24 ; we have only the pure Word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The recovered church has no denominations names , but the unique name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The deviation from the Word to heresies and the exaltation of so many names other than that of Christ are the most striking signs of degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The return to the pure Word from all heresies and traditions and the exaltation of the Lord s name by abandoning every other name are the most inspiring testimony in the recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why the church in the Lord s recovery has the revelation and presence of the Lord and expresses the Lord in a living way, full of light and with the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because we have an all-sufficient name, the name above every name, we do not need the names Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or any other names.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have only one name the name of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a serious matter to take a name.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose you are Mrs. Smith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you take the name of Mrs. Jones, it indicates that you have committed fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church should have only one husband, only one name, the name of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the past, some friends in the denominations have asked me, Why do you call yourselves the church?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Why do you say that we are not the church?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I answered, You call yourselves Presbyterian.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Don t blame me for this you have designated yourself in this manner.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you are the church, why do you designate yourself in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Are you Mrs. Smith? Then why do you call yourself Mrs. Jones? When I call you Mrs. Jones and say that I am Mrs. Smith, you are jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Don t blame me for this, for you have called yourself Mrs. Jones.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After this, all their mouths were shut.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not think that a name is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are saved in the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Besides His name, we should never take any other name.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>George Whitefield, a contemporary of John Wesley, once declared that besides the name of Jesus Christ he would have no other name.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although Whitefield was an Englishman, he renounced the name of the Church of England, not belonging to that name anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church in Philadelphia does not deny the Lord s name; she has no name other than His.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes people have argued with us, saying, We have never denied the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We replied, Yes, you have never denied His name, but you have taken another name in addition to and even above His name.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now you have two names.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Why don t you drop the other name you have taken?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you would drop this other name, then we could be one.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All other names cause divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You call yourself a Presbyterian.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I hate that name because taking it makes me a fornicator.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Since you like it and I hate it, if you still hold on to it, how can we be one?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But if you drop this name, we shall immediately be one in the unique name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some have said that the name on the outside of their so-called church building is merely an outward sign, and that they do not really care about it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If they do not care about it, then they should prove their honesty in this manner by removing that sign.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But some have said that it is too difficult for them to do that because the church board would hinder them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To this I replied, Then you must bear the responsibility for division.</S>
