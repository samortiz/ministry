The Church in Thessalonica</h2><p>[Thessalonica, like Philippi, was a city of the Roman Empire in the province of Macedonia, north of the province of Achaia. After the Macedonian call, which Paul received on his second journey of ministry, he and his co-worker Silvanus visited first Philippi and then Thessalonica (Acts 16:9-12; 17:1-4). The apostle stayed and worked there for only a short time, probably less than one month (Acts 17:2).<p>First Thessalonians 1:1 says, &#8220;Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&#8217;&#8217; Both 1 and 2 Thessalonians were addressed to the local church in Thessalonica, composed of all the believers in Christ in that city. Such a local church is of the believers and is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. This indicates that such a local church is born of God the Father with His life and nature and is united with the Lord Jesus Christ organically in all He is and has done. Hence, it is of men (such as the Thessalonians), yet in God and in the Lord organically.]<h2 class=head2>H. Spreading to the Province of Achaia, next to Macedonia-Churches Raised Up in:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Corinth-the Church in Corinth</h2><p>[The planting of the churches also spread to the province of Achaia. Achaia was south of Macedonia and was a province of the Roman Empire, a great part of today&#8217;s Greece, in which is the city of Corinth.<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 and 2 Corinthians 1:1 Paul addresses &#8220;the church of God which is in Corinth.&#8217;&#8217; The expression &#8220;the church of God&#8217;&#8217; is marvelous. It indicates that the church in Corinth was not the church of Cephas, of Apollos, of Paul, nor of any practice or doctrine, but of God. The church was constituted of the universal God, but it existed in Corinth, a definite locality on earth. In nature the church is universal in God, but in practice the church is local in a definite place.]<h2 class=head3>2. Cenchrea-the Church in Cenchrea, with a Deaconess</h2><p>[Another church in the province of Achaia was the church in Cenchrea. In Romans 16:1 Paul says, &#8220;I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea.&#8217;&#8217; Phoebe was a deaconess, that is, a serving one. Paul held her in such high esteem that in the following verse he said that &#8220;she has been a patroness of many and of myself as well.&#8217;&#8217; The word &#8220;patroness&#8217;&#8217; in Greek is a word of dignity, denoting one who helps, sustains, and supplies. Phoebe was a sister who served others at any price and at any cost. If we mean business with the Lord in the church life, we also need to serve the church and care for it regardless of the cost. The first requirement for the practice of the church life is that we serve the church.]<h2 class=head2>I. Spreading to Italy</h2><h2 class=head3>1. The Church Raised Up in Rome- the Church in Rome</h2><p>[Eventually, the establishing of the churches spread to Italy, and a church was raised up in Rome-the church in Rome. The fact that there was a church in Rome is indicated by Paul&#8217;s words in Romans 1:7: &#8220;To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints.&#8217;&#8217;]<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
