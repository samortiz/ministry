<h2 class="head1">CALLING ON THE LORD BEING<br />
THE KEY TO THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Apparently, the first two of the Epistles, Romans and 1 Corinthians, are not closely related. However, if we get into the kernel, depth, and mystery of these two books, we will see that they are one. Romans is rich in doctrinal teachings. Every chapter of that Epistle contains a basic doctrine. The key to the book of Romans, however, is in chapter 10. After all the teachings of the preceding chapters, verses 6 and 7 say, &ldquo;&lsquo;Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ down; or, &lsquo;Who will descend into the abyss?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.&rdquo; Christ has already come down from heaven in incarnation, and He has come up from the abyss in resurrection. We may ask, since Christ has come down from heaven and come up from the abyss, where is He? According to the Bible, there are three &ldquo;stories&rdquo; in the universe&mdash;heaven, the earth, and the abyss, which is under the earth (Phil. 2:10). Heaven is the highest story, the abyss is the lowest, and the earth is between these two. Since Christ has come down from heaven and come up from the abyss, we may say that Christ today is on the earth, but this is not specific enough. Today Christ is not only on the earth. As the living Word, He is also in our mouth (Rom. 10:8). Today we have not only the Christ who came down from heaven and came up from the abyss but also the Christ who is in our mouth.</p>
<p>Romans 10 goes on to tell us the way to participate in Christ&rsquo;s riches. Verses 12 and 13 say, &ldquo;There is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him; for &lsquo;whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rsquo;&rdquo; These verses do not tell us that Christ is rich to all who only study the Bible, pray all day, work for Him desperately, or fast regularly. Rather, Christ is rich to all who call upon His name. There is no more prevailing way to participate in and partake of His riches. We are not able to participate in the riches of Christ merely by studying the Bible. This can be compared to studying a recipe or a menu without eating the food itself. The way to partake of the riches of food is to eat. Likewise, the way to partake of the riches of Christ is to call on Him, saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A husband and wife may decide to read John 1 together. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; After they read this verse, the husband may ask, &ldquo;What is the beginning, and how could the Word be with God and also be God?&rdquo; Then the wife may reply that it is too puzzling to understand. This is the way of traditional Bible studies, from which those who participate receive little more than vain, empty knowledge. To study the Bible in a traditional way is like studying a menu without eating the food. The proper way to partake of the riches of Christ in John 1:1 is not to study this verse in a traditional way but to pray over, that is, to pray-read, this verse. We may pray-read John 1:1 by saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! In the beginning. Amen. O Lord, in the beginning was the Word. Hallelujah! Was the Word. Amen, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Reading and praying in this way makes a great difference. This is because the Lord is rich to all who call upon Him. If we pray-read John 1:1 for five minutes, we will be on fire. We will be nourished, watered, and even flooded with the riches of Christ. The way to enjoy Christ&rsquo;s riches is to call on Him. The Lord is rich to all who call upon Him. This is the key to Romans, the first Epistle in the New Testament.</p>
<p>The opening words of 1 Corinthians continue the book of Romans. Verse 2 of chapter 1 refers to &ldquo;all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours.&rdquo; In Romans we have the key to partaking of Christ&rsquo;s riches, but we do not have any instructions on how to use the key. The instructions are in 1 Corinthians. When we use the key to open all the doors in this Epistle, we find the riches of Christ in chapter after chapter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE POWER OF GOD,<br />
THE WISDOM OF GOD, AND OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>We have already seen a number of items of the riches of Christ in this Epistle. Chapter 1 contains five items: Christ as the power of God, the wisdom of God, righteousness for the past, sanctification for the present, and redemption for the future (vv. 24, 30). As human beings, we all have the three stages of the past, the present, and the future. We always need Christ as our righteousness for the past. Even for yesterday, we need Christ as our righteousness. Likewise, in every &ldquo;today&rdquo; we need Him as our sanctification, and we need Him as our redemption for the future. Christ&rsquo;s riches are in three aspects for each of the three stages of our existence.</p>
