<h2 class="head1">GOD'S PERFECT WILL AND PERMISSIVE WILL</h2><p>God has two kinds of will. One is His perfect will, and the other is His permissive will. God's perfect will is His ordained will; it exists from eternity to eternity and is executed in heaven without any hindrance. God's permissive will originates from God's foreknowledge and is based on God's perfect will; it passes through the world and eventually ends up in eternity.</p><h2 class="head1">BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD<br />AND FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD</h2><h2 class="head2">God's Plan Being<br />before the Foundation of the World</h2><p>God's plan was made before the foundation of the world. What kind of plan did God make before the foundation of the world? The first thing God purposed before the foundation of the world was to love the Son. John 17:24 tells us that the Father loved the Son "before the foundation of the world." The second thing that God purposed before the foundation of the world was to foreordain His Son to be the Christ. First Peter 1:20 says that "before the foundation of the world" God foreordained the Son to be the Christ. However, Ephesians 1:4-5 also tells us that God "chose us" in Christ and pre- destinated us "unto sonship" before the foundation of the world. (He chose men, but He predestinated them unto sonship.) Not only did God foreordain the Son to be the Christ, He also chose us in Christ and predestinated us unto sonship. Second Timothy 1:9 says that God gave us grace "before the times of the ages." Titus 1:2 says that God promised us eternal life "before the times of the ages." He promised that we would participate in His life. These two verses tell us that in order to receive the sonship, God predestinated us unto grace and life. All of these things were purposed by God before the foundation of the world.</p><h2 class="head2">The Fulfillment of God's Plan Being<br />from the Foundation of the World</h2><p>God's plan was purposed before the foundation of the world, but the fulfillment of His plan is realized from the foundation of the world. God accomplishes His plan through time. How does God accomplish His plan? Revelation 13:8 tells us that the Lord was slain "from the foundation of the world." Moreover, our names are written in the book of life from the foundation of the world. Hebrews 4:3 says that "the works of creation were completed from the foundation of the world." Matthew 25:34 speaks of "the kingdom prepared...from the foundation of the world." It is within the span of time that God created all things and accomplished redemption through Christ, writing the names of the redeemed ones into the book of life, giving them eternal life, and through this, preparing His kingdom.</p><p>God's eternal will was purposed in the first eternity, that is, before the foundation of the world. This is God's perfect will. Although the eternal plan of God was purposed before the foundation of the world, it is accomplished from the foundation of the world by passing through the world. This is God's permissive will. God's eternal plan will be fulfilled in the second eternity.</p>
