<h1 class="title">THE FUNCTION OF THE SMALL GROUP</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A FEW MATTERS REGARDING<br />
THE FORMATION OF SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>Concerning the formation of small groups, a few points need to be explained clearly. First, a small group is the gathering of a small number of neighboring believers; it is not a unit of organization. Hence, instead of designating the coming together of a small group as a meeting, it would be more appropriate and accurate to call it a gathering. There is a slight difference between a meeting and a gathering. When a few saints gather for fellowship, it should not be considered as a meeting.</p>
<p>A small group is a gathering, not an organized entity. In the church life, organization kills the saints, but the absence of organization enlivens the saints. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, a brother or sister must be able to attend any small group according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading. It is very important for us to see that the small groups are not organized units. If we consider a small group as an organized unit, the saints will be restricted in their ability to gather with a group according to their schedule and responsibilities. Small groups are not units of organization; they should be formed for the convenience of the saints. Hence, the saints should not be limited to one group. Nevertheless, the convenience of a saint does not mean that natural preferences and fleshly choices are acceptable. Natural preferences and fleshly choices must be avoided.</p>
<p>If we do not attend a small group because there is a brother or sister whom we dislike in the group, this is the flesh. The works of the flesh will result in corruption. We should not do anything according to the flesh. Furthermore, if we choose to join a group that has a &ldquo;spiritual giant,&rdquo; rather than a group composed of seemingly &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; saints, we will gain very little. God is not mocked. We should trust in God instead of putting too much trust in the condition of a small group. Often God&rsquo;s blessing can be restricted if the saints in a group are too strong. God is the God of orphans and widows. We need to humble ourselves before the Lord, looking to Him as if we were infants. Those who think they are capable are denied His blessings, but whenever we sincerely say, &ldquo;Lord, I do not know what to do; I truly am nothing,&rdquo; the blessing comes. We must trust in the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>In following the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we should not feel as if we are restricted to fellowshipping with only one group. After a period of time, the Lord may lead us to fellowship with a different group. There are no rigid rules in this regard. However, we should not make a change based on natural likes and dislikes, much less based on the flesh. Choices based on preferences and the flesh violate a spiritual law, and once a spiritual law is violated, there can be no blessing.</p>
<p>Second, the small groups are not religious organizations; therefore, no responsible ones should be assigned to take the lead. The practice of having no one assigned to take the lead is to not take the way of organization. Every organization depends upon a leading one, a responsible one, but based on our experience, a leading one often replaces the saints and kills their organic function. This is not profitable. When the Lord Jesus appointed twelve apostles, He did not designate a leader. When the names of the apostles are listed in the Bible, Peter is usually mentioned first (Matt. 10:2; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14; Acts 1:13). In Galatians 2:9, however, James is mentioned first. Therefore, we cannot say that Peter was always the leader. Hence, in our small group gatherings, no one has been given the responsibility to take the lead. Under normal circumstances, the grace that one has at the time of the gathering is the source of the group&rsquo;s leading. According to grace and fact, there will always be a leader, but this leading will not be based on a position or title. Everyone should be a leader in a small group because everyone has the same obligation and same opportunity to supply others.</p>
<p>Third, a small group should not pay attention to religious rituals. Today in the Sunday worship &ldquo;services&rdquo; in Christianity, hymns are sung, prayers are offered, the Word is read, and sermons are preached according to set procedures; these procedures are religious rituals. Even though these practices are not sinful, they kill the spirit within the believers and virtually annul their organic function. Overcoming this deadening condition is a focus of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover the exercise of the spirit and the organic functioning of the saints. Therefore, when we come together, we should not be concerned with religious rituals; as long as someone has a burden to pray or sing, he should function accordingly.</p>
<p>I began meeting in Christianity when I was a child. For over seventy years, I have seen many different situations. A considerable number of believers wait for a meeting to begin, but the Bible does not tell us when a meeting should begin. Although we have set a time to gather together, there is nothing wrong with coming early and beginning to pray. This is to have the fact of a beginning but not the formality of one. A small group recently testified that they met from 8:30 P.M. to after 11 P.M., with different saints coming at different times. This is a real break from religion and a genuine group gathering. We need to be flexible in the time of our group gatherings; otherwise, some saints may be shut outside the door.</p>
<p>We need to cast off the old ways that we have been following for decades, and the best way to cast them off is to gather in small groups. In practicing to gather in small groups, we should focus on exercising to touch spiritual reality. If we exercise in this way, there will surely be a blessing.</p>
<p>Fourth, the small groups are for fellowship in order to shepherd, teach, and mutually care for one another. When I go to different places to meet, the saints all think that I do not need any shepherding. Little do they realize that I also need to be shepherded. Whenever I go to a place, I truly look forward to the mutual shepherding. We all need mutual shepherding. None of us should be so proud as to think that we do not need any shepherding or teaching. Lambs are not the only ones in need of shepherding; even old sheep need to be shepherded. In fact, the older a person is, the more he needs to be cared for and shepherded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to have a mutual concern and care for one another. Christians are members one of another. When one member suffers, all the members suffer. We need to have a concern and care for one another. This cannot be accomplished in large meetings. Even if only one hundred people gathered together, it would be hard to show much concern and care for others. However, the concern and care that a member needs is easy to find in a group of ten or less saints. When a small number of saints gather together, it is easy to understand the conditions and situations of the other saints, which brings in true concern and care. This gives the Holy Spirit a great opportunity to grant us grace.</p>
<p>Fifth, we need to avoid worldliness in the small groups, especially in matters of eating, drinking, and pleasures. In a gathering of a certain group, everyone sat around the table eating from a hot pot. They chatted as they ate, and a newly saved sister was stumbled and no longer wanted to gather with the small group. This is eating, drinking, and having pleasures. <em>Pleasures</em> in the Bible is not a good word. James 4:3 says, &ldquo;You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly that you may spend it on your pleasures.&rdquo; If a small group occasionally has a love feast, it should be simple. A small group also should avoid celebrations. In a small group, those who gather together will become quite familiar with one another after a short period of time, and in their effort to render care to one another, some may think that occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries should be celebrated. However, we need to avoid mixing these occasions with the gathering of a small group. A small group gathering is not an occasion for celebrations. We are members of Christ; hence, our coming together is for the purpose of fellowshipping with one another. We should avoid worldly things.</p>
<p>Sixth, we need to avoid socializing. There is no place for vain talk or personal friendships in a small group, and even our fellowship should not be based on personal attachments. There should only be fellowship and love in the Lord.</p>
<p>Seventh, a small group is not an independent entity; it is only a small part of a local church. According to experience, some people like to be first, and they form small parties. In his third Epistle, John spoke of Diotrephes, who loved to be first among them (v. 9). Using a small group to form a small party or a faction is not acceptable; there is only one Body. A small group is not an independent entity, a &ldquo;body&rdquo;; it is only a small part in a local church. It can never become an independent entity. A small group must be according to the following principles. The saints in a small group are under the leadership of the elders in a local church. This is the only leadership. Even if there are eight hundred small groups, they are all still under the leadership of the elders. Furthermore, every small group must be open to the other groups in a local church, welcoming and accepting brothers and sisters from any other small group. In addition, the saints in a small group should not exclude other brothers and sisters or compete with other small groups.</p>
