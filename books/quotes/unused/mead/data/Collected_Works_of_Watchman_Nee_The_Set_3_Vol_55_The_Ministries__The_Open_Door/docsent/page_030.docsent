   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S GRADUAL ARRANGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have not written for a long time, but I often remember you in the fellowship of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thank the Lord that He has done some work in Shanba.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a work that is not from man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The meeting hall has already been purchased for a total of more than two hundred million yen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are two courts with a total of fourteen rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We use six of the large rooms for meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord has done a wonderful work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the beginning we borrowed, then rented, and now we are able to buy the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We never expected the owner to sell us the hall, because he is very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we rented it, the brothers and sisters prayed continually for this hall and asked the Lord to give it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank the Lord, He heard the prayers of His children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The owner suddenly announced he was going to sell the house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord did this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We saw the Lord's clear presence in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among the brothers and sisters, more than two hundred have been saved for less than two years, and there are not many wealthy ones among us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But within two weeks, we collected enough offerings for everything except a small balance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Glory be to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother, is the Lord leading you to have a conference in Shanghai?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please remember us when you pray.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May the Lord preserve you and be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chao Xu-dong</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May 15, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mailing Address: 28 Chung Cheng Road, Hsiapa City, West Suiyuan</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE REMOTE VILLAGE OF JIXINCHUN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peace to the brothers and sisters meeting in the Lord's name in Shanghai:</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past, we were very lonely in this remote mountainous region because communication was cut off during the war.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank the Lord that we heard of the revival and new light in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our hearts are filled with unspeakable joy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the Lord's marvelous doing!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We received the Lord's leading to come here in the winter of 1941 to open up the barren lands farming .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We began meeting at that time and have continued until now.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although we have passed through the attack of storms and winds, thank the Lord, the number of saved ones has increased.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is now one woman who truly believes in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She was possessed by demons but turned to the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were unable to preach the gospel when we first came here because we could not speak the local dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thank the Lord, a small number of brothers are now able to speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the brothers' harvests are not large, all are forced by the cares of this life to work very hard, and the Lord's work has been put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We feel shameful in our hearts and can only ask the Lord to open a door for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We also ask you brothers to pray for us!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We feel very weak because we are all infants in the Lord and very immature in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We only learn through petition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We deeply hope that some brothers from your locality could come here to lead and strengthen us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We would be happy to give them hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are sending a table of our condition for your perusal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the future, we ask you to instruct us much.</S>
