   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION Scripture Reading: Acts 9:1-9; 10:9-16; 13:2; Gal 1:16; 2:1-2; Eph 1:17 SERVICE ACCORDING TO NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Greek, the word revelation means unveiling, which is the opening of a covering, a veil, so that people can see what is inside.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, to reveal is to open a veil so that others can see.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In theology there are two categories of religion: natural religion and revealed religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this instance religion actually refers to service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, we prefer to use the term service in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Service according to nature is derived from the conditions of nature, and the knowledge concerning God that is associated with it is acquired through study and research.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the contrary, service according to revelation comes from God s direct speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the religions in the world are related to the category of natural service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>True worship and service are revealed by God Himself, and they bring us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can use medicine to see the difference between an understanding that is according to nature and an understanding that is according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a sick person tries to determine the best remedy for his sickness based on his own research and analysis, rather than a doctor s judgment, his understanding will be incomplete and natural.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, if a sick person receives a prescription from a doctor who is able to confirm its benefits, the sick person s understanding of the medicine will be according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Natural service is incomplete and inaccurate, but service according to revelation comes directly from God; hence, its completeness and accuracy are beyond question.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible is a record of God s revelation; it is God s opening the veil to reveal Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible is like a prescription given to us by a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though we have light from the Bible, there are still many people in Christianity who are involved only with natural service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to pay much attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Service according to revelation is a service that God grants us to see and touch.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Service according to revelation is different from service according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I was in Kaohsiung recently, the brothers asked me to speak something, and I had a feeling to speak about consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The speaking was full of the anointing, and this speaking was according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if I were to give the same message in Taipei simply because I enjoyed much grace when I spoke in Kaohsiung, my service would be natural rather than according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My speaking in Kaohsiung was truly a service according to revelation, but if I spoke the same subject in Taipei without an inner leading, my speaking would be according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Any service that is rendered according to the will of man or according to the environment is a doctrinal service, a natural service, no matter how well it is done.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Service according to revelation is a service that comes from contacting God and touching God s will in fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a service involving subjective spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Any service that results from the fashion of the times and from outward demands is natural service, not service according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we receive an anointing as we open ourselves and fellowship with God, the resulting service will be according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not be influenced by the environment; instead, we need to have direct fellowship and contact with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>EXAMPLES OF SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT The Example of Paul and Ananias</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before Saul met the Lord on the way to Damascus, he served God zealously, but his service was a natural service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before he met the Lord, he never truly touched God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, on the way to Damascus, he heard a voice from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although he was zealous for God in the heavens, he thought that he was only persecuting Christians on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When he heard the voice, he asked, Who are You, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Acts 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In his mind Saul had been persecuting Stephen and John, not the Lord in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nevertheless, through the Lord s speaking, Saul realized that he was persecuting Jesus when he was persecuting Christians on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After he fell to the ground and was blinded, he was able to rise up only when others led him by the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The eyes of many in the world should similarly be blinded in order for them to learn dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Saul needed others to lead him by his hand, the same hand that arrested and persecuted Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He could no longer depend on himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was the start of his service according to revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ananias s looking for Saul is also an example of service according to revelation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Example of Peter</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Another example involves Peter s service.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even after spending three and a half years under the Lord s leading, Peter still could not break away from his natural service to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, when he received a revelation from God in chapter 10, he went to Cornelius s house to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This service was according to revelation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>9-16, 24-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Service according to revelation is not derived from doctrinal consideration; it comes out of the revealed will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>HOW TO RECEIVE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order to receive revelation, we need to go before God and open to Him, consecrate everything to Him, and live in fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this way we will receive revelation from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not hold on to our own views or be influenced by our background, traditions, customs, and circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should condemn whatever God shines on, and we should obey God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this way, we will spontaneously receive revelation from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There must be the shining of light, and there must also be seeing in order for revelation to become a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the service of a believer and of the church should be according to revelation.</S>
