<h2 class="head3">Persecution</h2>
<p>Early in the history of the church, the Roman Empire aided the spread of the church by providing public security and ease of travel over a good transportation system. This was a great help in building up the church. However, the Roman Empire soon began to persecute the church; we do not know how many Christians were killed by the Romans. They persecuted the church to such an extent that one Roman official reported to Caesar that the more they killed Christians, the faster Christianity spread. Historians have noted that the Romans could not continue to kill Christians because the population of the Roman Empire would have decreased dramatically. The Roman Empire passed laws to persecute and kill Christians, and it even slaughtered them in large groups. But the more the Romans persecuted the Christians, the more people believed in the Lord. The Roman Empire stirred up ten great persecutions of the church in which they killed countless Christians.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Confusion</h2>
<p>In the fourth century, the emperor Constantine changed tactics, ended the persecution, and united the Roman Empire with the church. Thus, many elements of the Roman Empire and the church were intermixed, producing an illegal union of the church and the Roman Empire. Since the church should be the pure bride of Christ, its union with the Roman Empire was spiritual fornication; this was the fulfillment of the church in Pergamos in Revelation 2. Throughout church history the church has constantly faced this kind of problem and has shown a tendency to be mixed with politics. Not long after Constantine took the throne, Christianity became the national religion of the Roman Empire. Even today the Protestant churches are not entirely free of this mixture. When Martin Luther led the Protestant Reformation, he did not bring the church out of politics; on the contrary, the church under Luther became involved with politics. Many European countries have made Christianity their state religion and have not separated the church and the state. For example, the Anglican Church is the state church of England. Politics and the church are united; this mixture is even more serious than mixture with Judaism or Greek philosophy. Thus, the church has changed in nature and lost its standing as the church. The church has fallen from the heavens to the earth and from the hands of the Holy Spirit into the hands of political authorities. This is the situation of the church today. The union of the church and politics reached its peak in Catholicism, as seen in the fact that countries send ambassadors to the Vatican.</p>
<p>To know the church in these last days, we must know Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics, all of which should not have any position in the church. Mixture changes the nature of the church and causes it to lose its standing. Bringing these three things into the church has caused the church to suffer loss.</p>
<p>By A.D. 600 the Roman Catholic Church already included these three kinds of mixture; the religion, philosophy, and politics that the apostles had driven out of the church were welcomed into the Roman Catholic Church. The apostles had driven away Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and the Roman Empire, but the Roman Catholic Church joined herself to them. Catholicism incorporates many human things. The Roman Catholic Church is the mysterious Babylon the Great. She should have been a pure woman, but she became a great harlot. This harlot mixed together God, the devil, heaven, hell, the New Testament, the Old Testament, culture, and even the Lord&rsquo;s truth; all these have been mixed together in Catholicism.</p>
<p>In Revelation 18:4 the Lord says, &ldquo;Come out of her, My people.&rdquo; Whether good or bad, the Lord wants us to discard all things that are not of Christ, because the church is just Christ. God will not allow any human thing to be mixed into the church. Even Judaism, which was treasured by His people, cannot be mixed with the church, much less other things such as politics and philosophy. Catholicism has caused the church to lose its holiness, purity, and standing and to become a roosting place for demons and the dwelling place of Satan.</p>
<p>We study church history for the sake of the church today. We are in an era of confusion, darkness, and contrasting methods; therefore, we must examine in the light the biblical revelations and types concerning the church and the course of the church on the earth. Only in this way will we see what the church is, what its standing is, and the way it should take. This is why we have taken the time to examine the nature of the church, the types of the church, and the history of the church.</p>
<p>The church is spiritual, heavenly, and of Christ; the church is pure. Anything that is not spiritual, heavenly, and of Christ should not be brought into the church. Whenever we bring human things into the church, its nature is changed, it loses its standing, and it cannot bear its responsibility. In such a situation, the church has no function before God. The church is a vessel for Christ and the Body of Christ, and everything in it is out of Christ and for Christ. Therefore, the church can only be filled with Christ Himself. This should be the condition of the church. The church is absolutely separate from the world; although it is in the world, it is not of the world. Since the church is only passing through the world, it does not have the element of the world. The church is just Christ.</p>
<p>May the Lord give us the grace that this light would become stronger and stronger. Today we are in a thick fog; may the Lord dispel the fog and cause us to see what should be the condition of the church and to see the way we should take. I hope that in the future others could also see this light and not go astray.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
