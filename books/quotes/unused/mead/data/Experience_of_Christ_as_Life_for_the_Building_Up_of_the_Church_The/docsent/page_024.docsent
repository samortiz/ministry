   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Highest Point of Spirituality</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us consider 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul told us here that he did not have the commandment of the Lord, but he expressed his opinion v. 25 . Whatever he expressed as his opinion, we have to take as the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He expressed his opinion but he also said, "I think that I also have the Spirit of God" v. 40 . When we feel that we do not have the Lord's commandment, yet we express our opinion and this is of the Lord, this is the highest point of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Believers' Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chapter eight speaks about the believers' conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul speaks here of taking care of the weak ones and not wounding their weak conscience vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The conscience is the main part of our spirit Rom 8:16; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>9:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever the conscience is damaged, the flow, the fellowship, of the Spirit is cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other books the conscience is covered, but not in the way that Paul covers it in 1 Corinthians 8.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is because 1 Corinthians reveals that Christ is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit 15:45b; 6:17 , and the main part of our spirit is the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If our conscience is damaged, the flow between us and the Triune God will be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There will be insulation between us and the Lord, and we will feel deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sowing Spiritual Things and</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Enjoying Christ as Our Spiritual Food,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Spiritual Drink, and Spiritual Rock</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In chapter nine Paul said that he sowed spiritual things to the Corinthians v. 11 . Then in chapter ten he spoke of Christ as our spiritual food, spiritual drink, and spiritual rock vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Head Covering and the Lord's Table</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Chapter eleven covers the truth concerning head covering vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2-16 and the Lord's table vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>17-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Head covering is related to the headship of Christ, and the Lord's table is related to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, chapter eleven takes care of the Head and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It also speaks of the saints coming together not for profit but for loss v. 17 . Christians always think that as long as they come together that is good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Paul said that we may come together not for the better but for the worse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Body Being Christ</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The main point in chapter twelve is that the Body, the church, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 12 says, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This verse is unique in the Bible, telling us that Christ is not only the Head but also the Body.</S>
