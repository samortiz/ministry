   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being in the Forefront Is Having Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not God's intention that we listen to the authority that He has established because this person is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, God says that this person's authority is higher than ours; therefore, we need to listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not listen to this person because he is more perfect than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to listen to him because he is in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The basis for obedience is not that the one to whom you listen is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The basis for obedience is whether or not the one to whom you listen is in front of you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If something goes wrong, he bears the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God says that wives must obey their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The wife should not obey him on the basis of whether or not he is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If husbands had to be perfect, all of the wives in the whole world would not need to obey their husbands, because no husband is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The wife must obey her husband simply because he is the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether or not he is perfect is not the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The issue is whether or not he is the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If he is the husband, the wife needs to obey him period.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the same in the relationship and coordination among the co-workers in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If two are put together, then they should spontaneously know their place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When something happens, we should always know when to stand aside and say, "Brother, you speak.''</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should wait for him to speak because he is in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are not obedient to man's selection, but we are obedient to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once a brother stands in front of us, we should be obedient to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It would be strange if there were no one to obey and if we could not even find someone to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If this is the case, we have absolutely not seen the arrangement of God's authority in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the way when two brothers are together in the work: Spontaneously, Barnabas was in the forefront and Saul was behind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Holy Spirit's assignment, Barnabas was naturally put in front and Saul was behind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the beginning of Acts 13, Barnabas was in the forefront the whole way when they went out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 7 says, "Sergius Paulus...called Barnabas and Saul to him and sought to hear the word of God.''</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Again, Barnabas is spoken of and then Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Acts 13:1, I would like for you to notice that Barnabas was the first one among many prophets and teachers and that Saul was the last.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not think that Paul was advanced at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no such thing!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they went out, the last one was Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.''</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Barnabas was first, then Simeon, Lucius, Manaen, and lastly Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Among the five, the first was Barnabas and the last was Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps all of these others were ahead of Saul in the Lord at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they went out, the Holy Spirit also recognized Barnabas to be in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them'' v. 2 . Again it is Barnabas and Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Later, when they were on the way in verse 7, Sergius Paulus "called Barnabas and Saul to him and sought to hear the word of God.''</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Holy Spirit still recognized Barnabas as being in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, something very interesting occurred at this juncture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verse 9 the Bible records that Paul was filled with the Spirit in the work for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul's being filled with the Holy Spirit previously at his baptism was another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He repented, and he was saved and filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That was a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But in verse 9, the Bible records for the first time that "Saul, who is also Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here God did something through Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul performed a miracle by causing a man to be blind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later, they came to Pamphylia and then to another place called Antioch, a place with a similar name, except that it was Pisidian Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When they went into a synagogue on the Sabbath and sat down, the synagogue rulers asked them to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then Paul stood up.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the previous instance Paul performed a miracle, and here he preached.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This was the first time in Acts that someone preached other than Peter and Stephen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bible never records that Barnabas gave a long message.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Up to this point, only Peter had given a few long messages in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the day of Pentecost, he gave one message in chapter two and a few messages in the following chapters until his message in the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Other than the words of Peter and Stephen, the Bible does not record whatever was preached by others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Holy Spirit, however, allowed Paul to step forward to speak a strong word; the Spirit used him to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From that point forward, the wording in the Bible begins to change.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Acts 13:43 says, "And when the synagogue gathering had been dismissed, many of the Jews and the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas.''</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do you see it?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul is listed first.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 46 says, "And Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly,'' and verse 50 says, "But the Jews...raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and cast them out from their borders.''</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But this does not mean that this matter was settled.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we come to chapter fourteen, Barnabas was mentioned first one more time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This occurred after they returned to Lystra.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From chapter thirteen Paul was clearly in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even in chapter fourteen Paul was in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It was Paul who preached and healed the lame man.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then verse 12 says, "And they called Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, since he was the one who took the lead in the discourse.''</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Zeus and Hermes were the names of the gods of Lystra.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The heathen saw that Paul was the leading speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, when they addressed him with a name of their god, they used a name with a higher status because he was the one speaking and taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although verse 14 says, "Barnabas and Paul,'' with Barnabas being spoken of first, this is an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is a reason for this exception: When the priest of Zeus whose temple was outside the city heard that Zeus had come down from heaven, descending upon a person, he came quickly, bringing bulls and garlands to the gates, and he wanted to sacrifice with the crowds to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They thought that Barnabas was Zeus; therefore, they put Barnabas in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The priest of Hermes did not come, but the priest of Zeus came to sacrifice to his own god.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is why verse 14 says, "But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard this, they tore their garments.''</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It was natural for Barnabas to take the lead here, because the people thought Barnabas was Zeus.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, Barnabas jumped into their midst before Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Following this, we can see that the crowds originally were sacrificing to both apostles, but the apostles refused to accept such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As a result, "Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, supposing that he was dead.''</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Formerly, they wanted to sacrifice to him, but now they tried to stone him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>"But as the disciples surrounded him, he rose up and entered into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>And on the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.''</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Paul was the center of this incident.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>From this point onward until chapter fifteen, Barnabas's name was placed ahead of Paul's only one more time.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>That incidence also had its own reason.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Besides these two places, Paul always took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In chapter fifteen they returned to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What did they do when the trouble arose in Antioch?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>"No little dissension and discussion with them came about through Paul and Barnabas'' v. 2a . Later, when the brothers sent people to Jerusalem, "the brothers directed Paul and Barnabas and certain others among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this question'' v. 2b .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Barnabas spoke first in the meeting and then Paul because Barnabas was one who had come out of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Therefore, Barnabas naturally spoke first in the meeting, and then Paul gave an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The weighty persons always speak later.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Hence, those who speak later have a more respectable position.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The last one who spoke was James.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Bible says, "It then seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church to choose men from among them to send to Antioch together with Paul and Barnabas'' v. 22 . Paul was standing in the forefront, but when they wrote the letter, it was written by "Barnabas and Paul'' v. 25 . Barnabas was in front.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They could not have said that they sent Paul and Barnabas, because Barnabas was from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is the reason.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>After the problem in Acts 15 was resolved, it was still Paul and Barnabas, who "stayed in Antioch, teaching and announcing the word of the Lord as the gospel with many others also'' v. 35 .</S>
