   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At Mount Sinai God's people received the revelation concerning God Himself that they might be separated unto the holy God as His sanctified people Exo 20 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the revelation of God Himself, we refer to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law is a portrait of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before the children of Israel received the revelation concerning God's building, God gave them a portrait of Himself to show them what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The law reveals that God is a God of love and light and that He is holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, love, light, holy, and righteous are crucial words describing the characteristics of the almighty, Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the God of love and light, He is altogether holy; that is, He is uncommon, different, and separate from everything else in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, God is altogether righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is righteous with Himself, He is righteous in all He does, and He is righteous toward man and all His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is God as He is revealed in the picture in Exodus 20 24.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the New Testament we have a description of God, but we do not have a picture of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John tells us clearly that God is love and light, and Paul tells us that the very God who is love and light is absolutely holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Ten Commandments are a type signifying Christ as the portrait of God, as the expression of God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 1:3 says that the Son of God, Jesus Christ, is the express image of God's substance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Using a modern term, we may say that Christ is a photograph of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To see Him is to see God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The law is also a portrait of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By studying the commandments of the law, we can see that God is love and light and that He is holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the law is such a picture of God, the law was called the testimony of God Exo 25:16, 21; 31:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ark in which the law was placed was called the ark of the testimony Exo 25:22 , and the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of testimony Exo 38:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Psalms the law is often referred to as the testimony Psa 19:7; 25:10; 119:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This testimony was a portrait, a picture, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's people received the revelation concerning God Himself so that they might be separated unto the holy God as His sanctified people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This matter is given particular emphasis in the book of Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, Leviticus 11:44 says, "I am Jehovah your God; you shall therefore sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am holy."</S>
