   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Objects</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to consecrate not only people and affairs but also all objects.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are people who have to consecrate their jewelry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Others may have houses or clothing they have to consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some may only have a very small thing to consecrate, but they cannot allow this small thing to become a hindrance to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some may be holding back a few gold rings or some pearl ornaments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is nothing legal about this, but if we want to live a consecrated life, gold ornaments probably have to go, fashionable clothes have to go, and perhaps our money has to go.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people have been squandering their money and are not pleasing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many others have been saving their money and likewise are not pleasing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Squandering has no place in the eyes of the Lord, just as saving has no place in His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not spend our money all at once; we should transfer it to the Lord's account.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament, nothing is said about tithing a tenth of what we have; the only thing that is spoken of is putting everything in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first day we take home our wages, we should tell the Lord, "God, all of this money is Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Give me back what I need for my household expenses."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not a question of using a certain amount and then saving the rest for God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I dare not say that God will or will not take all you have at times.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But I would say that if we have truly consecrated everything to God, what is consecrated belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many brothers and sisters have furnishings in their homes, clothes in their closets, or possessions in their hands that are unbecoming of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once the Lord touches these things, we have to consecrate them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have a few elderly brothers and sisters with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have to be careful how you write your will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whatever you write will show the kind of Christian that you are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since all of our money belongs to God, we should not put the money back into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we plan for our children and allow them to take our money back to the world, we are not doing the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has separated us and our possessions from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not allow them to go back to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Israelites left Egypt, they did not leave one animal in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The same should be true with us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of course, we cannot do this, but thank God that everything is possible with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Philippians 4:13 says, "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that as soon as the Lord energizes us, we can do all things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is impossible for us to offer up all things, but we can do it by the One who empowers us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since Christ is our life, we can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many young brothers and sisters can consecrate what they have when they do not have that much.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they become richer, their offerings become less.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the Lord gains our heart, He should gain our wallet as well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the heart closes up, it means that the wallet is closed up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the wallet is not open, the heart can never be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should consecrate people, affairs, and objects, but the last thing we should consecrate is ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to consecrate ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should say, "God, I consecrate myself to You to do Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, we do not know what lies ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we know that God has a will for every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It may not be blessings, and it may not be sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But we have to consecrate ourselves to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should be willing to accept His will, whether it comes with blessing or suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many people are willing to be used by God; they are filled with the Spirit and live the overcoming life continuously because they have consecrated themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What kind of consecration is this?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is a consecration in which we present our bodies as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible never speaks of the consecration of the heart; it only speaks of the consecration of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No one who has consecrated himself can leave his body unconsecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have consecrated our whole being to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Henceforth, our mouth is not our own.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our ears are not our own, and our eyes, hands, feet, and even bodies are not our own.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From now on we are merely the Lord's managers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>From now on our feet are the Lord's, and we cannot use them for ourselves any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When a young man died, his old father charged the pallbearers to be very careful, because that body had served as the Lord's temple for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, we should not wait until we have died for our bodies to be consecrated to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today the Holy Spirit is already living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First Corinthians 6:19 says, "Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One hymn says, "Let my hands perform His bidding;/Let my feet run in His ways./...All for Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All for Jesus!/Let my lips speak forth His praise" Hymns, #444 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the meaning of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is what it means to consecrate our body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No one should say that his body is his own.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every single day of our life is for the Lord, and our whole body is for the Lord; we are merely His managers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once in another country, someone was passing the offering plate on a Sunday morning.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the plate came to a thirteen-year-old girl, she repeatedly asked that the plate be lowered.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the plate was lowered to the ground, she stepped onto the plate.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She had no money, and therefore, she decided to offer herself up.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today we should not only consecrate people, affairs, and objects to the Lord but also consecrate ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Every Lord's Day when we put the money into the offering box, we should put ourselves into it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we hold ourselves back, God does not want our money.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God will not have "ours" unless He first has "us."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God must have us first before He will have ours.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There are many people who will consecrate themselves to the Lord, and the Lord will not necessarily ask them to be preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He may want some to be good businessmen.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Every corner in this world needs light, and we cannot choose our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should say to the Lord, "From now on I resolve to do Your will."</S>
