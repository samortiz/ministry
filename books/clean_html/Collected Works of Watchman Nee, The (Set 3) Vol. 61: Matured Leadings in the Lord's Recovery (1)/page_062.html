<h2 class="head2">Handing Oneself Over<br />Bringing in the Power of Explosion</h2><p>I hope that one day we can break open Hong Kong with explosive power. We do not have to wait for a big co-worker to come to do the job. We have to hand ourselves and all we have over and coordinate together to preach the gospel in oneness. No one should be for himself. Everyone should offer up everything for the gospel. Let me shout this into our ears: We cannot crave one single thread in this world, while asking the other brothers and sisters to give up the world or to see the vanity of this world. We cannot love money ourselves, while telling them to love the Lord. If we do not hand ourselves over, we cannot demand others to sacrifice their life. Perhaps some will feel that this is a bit too extreme, but in this matter, it does not hurt to be extreme. We have been extreme in many things in our life. Should we be careful to stay within the bounds when it comes to our consecration to the Lord? If we have never been extreme once, we will never be able to lead others to do the same.</p><h2 class="head2">Making Friends with Mammon</h2><p>We must not hesitate in handing ourselves over. Once we procrastinate, our mind will come under the attack of Satan. Some may think that we are mad when we hand over our possessions. Actually, this is not madness; this is the gospel. The demand of the gospel is so great that it calls for our very life. In this world only two kinds of people are willing to give up their possessions. The first are the mad and insane. The second are those who sacrifice for love. We hand ourselves over because we love the Lord. We do not care about criticism. We only care for the Lord's commands. If we do not uphold this truth, we will end up suffering. Always remember the Lord's word that we have to make friends with the mammon of unrighteousness (Luke 16:9). Once we hand ourselves over, we will have a share when the church gains people through the gospel. We will be blessed. If we do not hand ourselves over, we will not have a share even if the church gains many people.</p><p>Today the Lord's timing is ripe. Whether or not we are actually doing the preaching, we will have a share in the Lord's work as long as we hand ourselves over. Thank the Lord. Once the gospel breaks out, we will see the Lord's blessing. Perhaps when that day comes we will no longer be here, but our offering will still be here. Today brothers everywhere are adding their share to the work. I hope that we all will join them. Once this flame is ignited, it will never go out. I hope that the flame in Hong Kong never goes out.</p><h2 class="head2">Handing Over Being the Responsibility<br />of Every Brother and Sister</h2><p>Handing over oneself is not just a responsibility of the co-workers. It is a responsibility that is on all of our shoulders. We have gathered too much for ourselves, yet our eyes are always on the purse of the co-workers. Criticism and gossip about this and that co-worker often come to my ears. I have to say a word for the co-workers. These workers are God's workers; they are not your workers. If you can be God's counselor, you can manage the co-workers' purses. If I say this word to the co-workers, it is not worth much, but it is good for you.</p><p>If all of us, young and old, will consecrate our all, the cheap way with us in the past will be gone once and for all. We have to make up our mind to have a share in the gospel of the church. We have to hand over our occupation, our time, and our money for the gospel. This is the only way to bring in the power. The Lord will not be satisfied until we preach the gospel this way. The only thing that will satisfy the Lord is for the entire Body to be consecrated. The only thing that will satisfy us is this very same thing.</p><p>Our handing over will satisfy the Lord, and it will satisfy us. Time is short. The Lord's coming is near, yet the responsibility of the gospel is still great. Many places in China still have not heard the gospel. If the church does not rise up together to preach the gospel, the Lord will delay His coming.</p><p>I hope that from this day forward we will drop all dissenting thoughts. Let us abandon all care for ourselves. We should have only one profession&mdash;preaching the gospel. We should have only one goal&mdash;letting all sinners hear the gospel. If we do this, it will not be difficult to gospelize Hong Kong and all of China.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2><p>The handing over that we are speaking about is more demanding than just offering up all of our possessions. Handing ourselves over means offering up our entire being, including our time and occupation, for the coordination. Our eyes are not set on our wealth. Our God is not a poor God. He is the God of everything. We expect the Body to rise up to preach the gospel; the church should rise up to preach the gospel. When the church rises up to preach the gospel, we will be perpetually short of meeting halls. One meeting hall will not be enough; even ten meeting halls will not be enough. Today we are seeing the light. It is not a matter of eight or ten being called to forsake everything to preach the gospel by themselves. All the brothers and sisters have to rise up to preach the gospel together. Today this fire has started. I hope none of us will run away from this fire.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER</h2><p>Brother Weigh: Lord, some of us have come to Hong Kong as travelers. Some have come as refugees. We have become loose because we have been greatly influenced by the Babylonian environment around us here in Hong Kong. For all these years the church has not been absolute enough to rise up to preach the gospel together. Forgive us and grant us the grace. Lord, You have come to cast a fire upon the earth. You said this when there was a baptism awaiting You; Your spirit was pressed! You have gone through that baptism, and Your life has been released. The fire has been released, and it has been burning during the past centuries. Today in China this fire has started in Chefoo, Shanghai, Foochow, and Chuenchow. Now we ask that You start this fire in Hong Kong. Start it within all the brothers and sisters. May Your love and mercy continue their great work. Today, we have to catch up with You or else we will be cast aside. May Your great love and mercy enable us to catch up. Amen.</p>
