   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-TWO THE RENEWING OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Col 3:5-11; Rom 12:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last two chapters of Colossians cover various aspects of the Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first aspect is that we seek the things above and set our mind on them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul s charge to seek the things above is based on the revelation presented in chapters one and two.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that our seeking of the things above must be based on the revelation of the Person and work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Colossians 1 and 2 Christ is revealed in a marvelous way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, the work Christ has accomplished for us is also presented in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these chapters Christ is revealed as the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Based on this revelation of Christ s Person and work, we may seek the things which are above.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we have pointed out, these things refer to Christ s heavenly ministry, to His ministry as the High Priest, Minister, and Administrator of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CORRESPONDING TO CHRIST S HEAVENLY MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is not idle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is interceding, ministering, and executing God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We on earth should respond to Christ s activities in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although Christ in His earthly ministry fully accomplished redemption for our salvation, He has not yet completed the building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the building up of the Body, His ministry in heaven is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not the desire of Christ simply to have a large group of saved people; He wants the saved ones to be built up together as His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ desires a Body, a building, a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to have the Body built up, Christ must carry on the work of His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Between Christ in heaven and us on earth there is a divine transmission, a heavenly current.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are receiving this transmission, we shall respond to Christ s work in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if in our experience we are not continuously connected to Him or if we allow insulation to build up between us and Him, the transmission will cease.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is most pitiful that among many genuine Christians today the connection with the heavenly Christ in their experience has been severed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are genuine Christians, but they do not experience the divine current, and there is no fellowship between them and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We hope that the situation among us will be absolutely different from this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of being cut off from the heavenly Christ, in our experience we need to continually receive the divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Day and night, we should be infused with a supply from heaven, and experience the transaction between the heavenly Christ and us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should continually respond to Christ s interceding, ministering, and executing of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To seek the things above means that we correspond to Christ s heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Colossians 3, corresponding to Christ s heavenly ministry by seeking the things above is the first aspect of our Christian walk.</S>
