After reading it, we were filled with unspeakable thanksgiving to our Father. At the same time, we were also filled with shame, because we have remembered our sisters so little. I can only ask the Lord to forgive us for the past and to lead us on in the future. I will now report a little concerning the matters you raised in your letter. Sister Chao Jing-tze has fled from Sung-Jiang to Zhu-Sin-Sung Paper Works of San-Fang-Kou in Li-Shui, Chekiang province. Thank God for preserving her. Sister Yu Fang-rue has returned to Shangtung. Sister Yin Hsia-chin is still living one floor above the meeting hall and is not in any danger. Thank God that Sister Lu Zheng-shien has written to inform us that she is completely recovered. I heard that the sisters in Ning-Po have all fled to the countryside. After Miss Cheng learns of their new location, she will write to you. Sister Hsu Ching-hwa is doing very well. Sister Liu Ching-dong has returned to Canton. Sisters Shen Ching-hwai and Cheng Fang are well. The sisters working at the Railway Hospital are mostly staying at Hai-Geh Road. Sister Lin Yun-chang and her whole family are moving to Manila, and she will write to you when she arrives. Mrs. Lin Bu-zhi has returned to Shanghai and is well physically. Sister Ruan Dan-yun's relatives have moved out of Chi-Bao and are now living in the French Concession district. Sister Wang Yu-ying is doing well; her students have moved to the Jin-Chen Villa. Sister Lee Shi Sai-ho and Sister Cheng Yi-feng are all well. Brother Si Jiu-rong has moved to 74 Shi-Ming Villa. The Tuesday women's meeting is continuing as before. Thank the Lord that more sisters are engaged in personal work and more have come to listen to our preaching now. The Saturday sisters' meeting is more lively than before, and the time has been changed to 4 p.m. The children's meeting has not started due to the lack of a suitable place. The Monday night prayer meeting in all the homes has stopped completely. Most of the other meetings are more or less the same as before. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to Brothers Nee, Luan, and Lan and Sisters Chang, Wang, and Tso.</p><p>Sisters Lee Shi Sai-ho, Lin Shue Yun-chang,<br />Cheng Feng-yi, Luh Wang Yi-rong<br />December 17<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Family Letter to Brother Chang Yu-zhi,<br />Shanghai</h2><p>My younger brother Yu-zhi:</p><p>Last Thursday night during the prayer meeting I mentioned your name and asked the brothers and sisters to pray for you. Brother Yang Jun has returned to Shanghai. Brother Chung-chen said that he wished that the Lord would raise up responsible brothers here. Brother You-an is still in Shanghai, and his son is studying at Jung-Fa. Brother Kwang-rong's whole family is safe.

Even the blind brother, Peter Ho, and his whole family were not hurt. Some brothers have moved out of east Shanghai; they are also safe. Brother Chu En-seng and his family have not moved out yet, but we trust that they are safe. Han-jing and Neng-sheng are still in Shanghai.
