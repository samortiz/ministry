   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TEXT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this lesson we shall cover another aspect of redemption, that is, justification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the believers are forgiven, freed, washed, and sanctified, they have no more problems before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, God has the position, the ground, to justify them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Bible, justification means that God, according to His righteousness, declares that man is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, when God justifies man, He justifies man according to His standard of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I. MAN NOT JUSTIFIED BY WORKS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since justification means that God, according to His righteousness, declares that man is righteous, how can man be justified by God through his own works?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s righteousness is perfect and supreme.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But no one is perfect in works before the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible, therefore, definitely tells us that by the works of law no flesh shall be justified before God Rom 3:20; Gal 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man s righteousnesses simply cannot stand before the righteousness of God; they are even like a filthy garment Isa 64:6 , being unable either to match the requirement of God s righteousness or be justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, man can never be justified by works before God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>OBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION A. By God s Grace</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man is justified first by God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of man s own weakness, no one can be justified before God by works of law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone, however, can be justified by the grace of God Rom 3:24; Titus 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Justification by law requires man to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a requirement which no one can meet.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Justification by grace is God s approving man by fulfilling for man freely all the requirements of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a gift we all can receive and obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because God has done everything that we may be justified freely, there is no need for us to do anything, neither to use any effort nor pay any price.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has done it all for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, this is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What we cannot obtain by law we can receive by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>B. Through the Redemption in Christ Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are justified by God s grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus Rom 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the Lord Jesus had not shed His blood on the cross and accomplished redemption to satisfy all the requirements of God s righteousness for us, God would have no ground and no way to justify us by His grace even if He desired to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, without the redemption in the Lord Jesus, the grace by which God justifies us cannot reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus, however, has shed His precious blood and paid the price on the cross, thus satisfying all the requirements of God s righteousness Rom 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, God can justify us by His grace according to His righteousness that we may be justified according to His standard of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>C. By Faith in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man is justified by God s grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus and also by believing into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Faith Being the Way to Be Justified</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Bible clearly and definitely indicates that a man is not and cannot be justified before God by works; he is and can only be justified by faith Gal 3:8; 2:16; Rom 3:22, 28; Acts 13:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By works is to rely on our own doing, whereas by faith is to trust in what Christ has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Works require our effort to do, to perform; faith is our receiving, obtaining, without effort.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one has the strength to do, but everyone can believe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Acts 13:39 says, And from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses, in this One Christ everyone who believes is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ has died for us and shed His blood to accomplish redemption, satisfying God s righteous demand, so that God can justify us according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if we do not believe, Christ and what He has done have nothing to do with us, and we still cannot be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, we must be joined to Christ through faith; we must believe into Him and by faith receive Him and what He has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only then can we participate in Him and in His redemption, and only then can we be in Him and be justified through His redemption.</S>
