   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the Churches Being the Same in: a. Receiving the Teachings</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the churches are the same in receiving the teachings of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Corinthians 4:17b Paul says, "Even as I teach everywhere in every church."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the apostles' teaching is the same universally, not varying in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Corinthians 7:17 Paul says, "Only as the Lord has allotted to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And so I direct in all the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a further indication that all the churches were the same in receiving Paul's teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1 Corinthians 16:1 Paul goes on to say, "Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you do also."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here Paul instructed the church in Corinth to do what he had directed the churches of Galatia to do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a further indication that all the churches under Paul's ministry were one in the apostles' teaching Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 16:17 tells us that some "make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"The teaching which you have learned" is the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever is taught in the churches should be the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should be cautious of anyone who teaches in a way that is contrary to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Timothy 1:3 says, "Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently, that is, to charge them not to teach differently from the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The apostles' teaching is not the teaching of a particular doctrine like baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The main emphasis of the apostles' teaching is God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The constituents of God's New Testament economy are the person and redemptive work of Christ and the church as the reproduction of Christ and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some who do not realize that all the churches should be the same in receiving the apostles' teachings may think that a certain teaching is good for one church but not for their church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To have this attitude is to be closed to the fellowship among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Any teaching that is good for a particular church is good for all the churches on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, if a teaching is not good for a particular church, it should be rejected by all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no thought in the New Testament that a teaching is good for one church but not for the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, the New Testament reveals that the churches should be the same in receiving the teachings. b.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Practicing the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The churches should be one not only in receiving the teachings but also in practicing the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, some may think that a practice is good for a certain church but not for all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, Paul charged all the churches to have the same kind of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Two portions of 1 Corinthians clearly indicate this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first concerns head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are different thoughts concerning head covering, but Paul told the saints in 11:16 not to be contentious concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"If anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The custom here is the custom of contention, disputation, and debate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Neither the apostles nor the churches tolerated any disputation concerning the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fact that Paul here speaks of "the churches of God" indicates that all the churches should act in the same way according to the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The practice of all the churches should be uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First Corinthians 14:33b and 34 say, "As in all the churches of the saints, let the women be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but let them be subject, as the law also says."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This also indicates that all the local churches should be the same in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This prohibition of the sisters speaking in the church means that women are not permitted to teach with authority concerning the defining of doctrine cf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1 Cor 11:5; Acts 2:17-18; 21:9; 1 Tim 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The two practices concerning head covering and concerning women's ministry confirm that all the churches should be one in the same kind of unique practice.</S>
