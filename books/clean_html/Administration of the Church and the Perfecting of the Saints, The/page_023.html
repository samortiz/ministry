<h2 class="head1">BEING POOR IN SPIRIT AND PURE IN HEART</h2>
<p><em>Question: Many saints were in a good condition when they served, but their condition deteriorated when they went astray. Since there is no guarantee that I will not go astray in the future, is it not dangerous to serve?</em></p>
<p>Answer: None of us is free from making mistakes. The only person in the Bible who never erred was the Lord Jesus. Even the apostle Paul made mistakes. Every human being makes mistakes. Some, however, make mistakes but do not depart from the right way, yet others depart from the right way as soon as they make a mistake. When the Lord Jesus spoke concerning the constitution of the kingdom in Matthew 5, He gave two basic conditions: one is to be poor in spirit, and the other is to be pure in heart (vv. 3, 8). If, instead of being poor in spirit or pure in heart, we have pursuits other than God, it will be easy for us to depart from the right way when we make a mistake. However, if we are poor in spirit and pure in heart, we will not depart from the right way, even though we may make many mistakes.</p>
<p>If we examine those who have gone astray, we will see that the problem was not a matter of right or wrong but of whether one was poor in spirit and pure in heart. A person who is not poor in spirit is self-satisfied and unable to receive help from others. A person who is not pure in heart has something other than God as his goal. The Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God&rdquo; (v. 8). God should be our unique goal. As soon as our goal deviates from God, our heart is no longer pure. It is easy for those who are not pure in heart and have pursuits other than God to stray from the right way when they make a mistake. Several churches in the Far East have passed through turmoils. Before going astray and leaving, some were quite vocal in their support of the church, but after they left, they stopped speaking concerning the church. This proves that something other than God was their goal and that they were not pure in heart. Therefore, being kept on the right way in spite of our mistakes depends on whether we are poor in spirit and pure in heart.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS&rsquo; TERM OF OFFICE</h2>
<p><em>Question: In the Bible the elders&rsquo; term of office seems to be for life. But in practice should the elders follow the practice of the Old Testament priests and retire at the age of fifty?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The term of the Old Testament priests ended when they reached the age of fifty (Num. 4:3; 8:24-25) because one&rsquo;s physical strength begins to decline at the age of fifty. According to this principle, if the elders are declining spiritually or physically, they should withdraw and let others serve as elders. At the age of fifty Old Testament priests withdrew from the service because their strength began to decline. The New Testament does not give an age limit for the service of the elders, but we should withdraw and let others serve as elders if our physical strength begins to decline. If we begin to decline and cannot keep up, we should let others serve.</p>
<p>If our condition is proper, every elder should be clear whether his being an elder benefits the church. He should know whether it would benefit the church for him to stay or for him to withdraw. He should make such a decision in the best interest of the church. The principle of withdrawal from the eldership should be fresh and a matter of life. Every elder should consider the current condition of his local church to know whether it would be beneficial to the church for him to remain or to withdraw. We should not consider matters for ourselves but should consider the gain and loss to the church. If the church gains from our staying, we should stay, but if the church suffers loss from our staying, we should not stay. This is a healthy condition.</p>
<p>There is no rule concerning whether we should withdraw from the eldership. Our withdrawal depends on the Spirit and on the gain or loss that the church would incur. If we are poor in spirit, pure in heart, and do not covet anything, we will accept how the Lord leads when He leads. However, if we covet something, are self-satisfied, and are not poor in spirit or pure in heart, we will make things difficult.</p>
