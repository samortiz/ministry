We think that we know God's salvation. Actually, we are far from God's perspective. Yesterday I said that Christians are like those who do not understand their ABC's yet who try to learn English. They do not understand even the basic teachings of the Christian life. In the word of one brother, they do not know the very first lesson of the human life. Even if a man can achieve an inward moral cultivation, like Wang Yang-ming [a Chinese philosopher], he is still acting in an outward way; he is a tree without roots and a river without a source. Even if we can be like Job, fearing God and eschewing evil, and even if Satan cannot accuse us, is this all God's salvation will do in us? Is this our only understanding of His salvation? This is the reason I have a heavy burden. I cannot let this matter go by easily. (Brother Nee: "That is right!")</p><p>Let me ask Brother Kwo-kwang, "Are you hoping that you will become blameless, upright, humble, and virtuous after you are revived? Are you hoping that what you think, what you see with your eyes, and what you say with your mouth will be right, and that your conscience will be fully at peace in God? Do you think that it is enough to have all these things before God?" (Brother Kwo-kwang: "I have never thought of this.") This is probably true. Not only have you never thought of this; perhaps many of us here have never thought of this. This is the reason I have to tell you and everyone else that God's salvation is ultimately not for delivering us from sin but for imparting life to us.</p><p>It is true that in His salvation, our sinful history before God is dealt with on the objective side, and the sin within us is taken care of on the subjective side. But this is not God's final destination. The ultimate goal of God's salvation is to bring us into His life. What is God's salvation? God's salvation is for Him to come forth, to enter into us to be our life, and for us to live in His life and to remain there.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL<br />AND THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p>Let me ask again: What is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and what is the tree of life? What is the difference between these two trees? Simply put, the difference is the difference between law and grace. The consequence of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is death, and the consequence of the tree of life is life. Within the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are good, evil, and knowledge. These things, together with the death that comes with them, are included in this tree. The skill that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil renders is the ability to know, and the end is death. But the tree of life is God, and the end is God coming to us as life. Once God comes forth, and man touches Him, he has life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is something entirely outside of God. The result of touching this tree is surely death. As a Christian we are revived. Before we were revived, we touched evil. Now that we are revived, we touch good. But whatever we touch, we are still touching the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Please remember that good and evil belong to the same tree. Neither good nor evil belongs to life. The acts of the Chinese bandits are, of course, not life. But the virtuous acts of the Chinese sages such as Confucius, Mencius, and Wang Yang-ming are not life either. In Chinese Christianity, many sermons are Bible-based Confucianism. This is a grave error. If we only touch good, the result is nothing but death. Only by touching God Himself will we have life.</p><p>It was not that easy for Adam to touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because that tree was outside of him. Today it is easy for us to touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because this tree is inside us. Actually, we are almost this very tree itself. Today we have a harder job than Adam had in dealing with this matter. This tree is within us today; it is very subjective to us. At the beginning, Adam had to consider before taking of that tree; it was still objective to him. But this tree is very subjective to us. We can take it without any consideration at all. Thank the Lord that Christ's salvation is in the tree of life, not in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Brothers and sisters, please remember that touching good is not the same as touching the spirit. We should not think that as long as we have touched good, we have touched life. We should not presume that once we have touched good, we have touched God. Our pride is not life, and our humility is not life. Our rashness is not life, and our meekness is not life. Evil is not life, and good is not life. What then is life? Only that which is from God is life. Life is not a matter of good and evil. Life certainly is not evil, but neither is life good. Although life is bright, holy, and good, it is not the goodness of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; it is the goodness that belongs to God Himself (Matt. 19:17). Life is God Himself; life is Christ (John 1:4).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_086.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_088.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 87</div><br></body></html>
