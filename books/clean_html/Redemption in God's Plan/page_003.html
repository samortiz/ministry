<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S CREATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:1, 26-27, 31; 2:7-9, 16-17; Psa. 90:2; Eccl. 7:29; Rev. 4:11</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that in eternity past God had a plan. In that plan He purposed to gain many brothers for His Son. These many brothers have the life of the Son and the image of the Son and will eventually enter into glory.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will see how God carries out His plan. In order to carry out His plan, God created all things. This was the first step in carrying out His plan. However, in order to understand creation, we must first see God&rsquo;s characteristics.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING ETERNAL</h2>
<p>Psalm 90:2 says that God is &ldquo;from eternity to eternity.&rdquo; The word <em>eternity</em> is used two times in this verse. The first use of <em>eternity</em> is a reference to eternity past, and the second use of <em>eternity</em> is a reference to eternity future. From man&rsquo;s perspective, there is the past and there is the future, but from God&rsquo;s perspective, there is only eternity. Therefore, He is God in eternity, He is God from eternity to eternity, and He is God from eternity past without beginning to eternity future without ending. Hence, God is eternal; He is without beginning or ending. God can be compared to a circle that does not have a starting point or an ending point.</p>
<p>One of God&rsquo;s names is Jehovah. <em>Jehovah</em> means &ldquo;I am who I am&rdquo; (Exo. 3:14). This indicates that God is self-existing and ever-existing. He is without beginning and without ending, and He exists from eternity to eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE OF GOD BEING UNCREATED</h2>
<p>Since God is without beginning and without ending, existing from eternity to eternity, His life must also be without beginning and without ending. A life that is without beginning and without ending must be an uncreated life. Any life that has a beginning and an ending is a created life. The life of God is uncreated because His life is without beginning and without ending. Therefore, the Bible refers to the life of God as eternal life. God is eternal, so His life is also eternal. Since His life is eternal, it is also uncreated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING TRIUNE</h2>
<p>God is eternal, and He is also triune. Genesis 1:26 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; In Hebrew the word <em>God</em> in this verse is plural. Furthermore, in this verse God refers to Himself as &ldquo;Us.&rdquo; This shows that God is triune. There are many other places in the Bible where God refers to Himself as &ldquo;We&rdquo; or &ldquo;Us&rdquo; (3:22; 11:7; Isa. 6:8; John 17:21-22). This proves that God is triune. This does not mean that there are three Gods. There is only one God (Isa. 45:5; 1 Cor. 8:4). From eternity past to eternity future there is only one God. Although God is one, He is also the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Hence, He is triune. He is one yet three, and He is three yet one. He is the Triune God.</p>
<p>This is not easy for us to grasp. Let us use water as an illustration. Water vapor is in the air. When water vapor cools down, it condenses into water. If water is cooled down further, it turns into ice. Vapor, water, and ice are actually one thing. Water vapor is abstract, not visible. When vapor turns into water, it is visible but not very concrete. When water turns into ice, it can be touched and held because it is solid and concrete. This illustration is inadequate, but it can help us a little more in our understanding of the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is God Himself, the Son is the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit is the Holy Spirit. The Father, Son, and Spirit are not three separate persons. In terms of the aforementioned illustration, the Father can be likened to vapor, the Son can be likened to water, and the Holy Spirit can be likened to ice. God the Father is hidden; He cannot be seen or touched by man (1 Tim. 1:17). Hence, He is abstract, just like vapor in the air. One day God became a man (John 1:14). God the Son is the expression of the Father (v. 18; 14:9). The Father is in the Son (v. 10). Just as a son comes out of his father, the Son came out of the Father (8:42). Just as a son has the life of his father, the Son has the life of God the Father (5:26). Hence, when we see the Son, we know the Father. Without the Son there is no way for the Father to be manifested. Hence, the Bible says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (1:18). He who has seen the Son has seen the Father (14:9). The Son is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of His substance; hence, the Son is God manifested (Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:15). God hidden is the Father; God manifested is the Son. The Father is the source of the Son, and the Son is the manifestation of the Father. Just as the Son is the declaration of the Father, the Spirit is the declaration of the Son (John 15:26; 16:14-15). Just as God the Father is manifested in the Son, so the Son is realized and contacted as the Spirit. The Father came to dwell among men as the Son, and the Son enters into man as the Spirit. Without the Spirit, God can only dwell among men and be seen by men as the Son, but He cannot enter into man in order to be contacted or experienced by man. God is not only the Son; He is also the Spirit. Hence, He can enter into man to be contacted by man. The Father is God hidden, the Son is God manifested, and the Spirit is God entering into man. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the Triune God from eternity to eternity. As the Father, God is hidden; as the Son, God is manifested; and as the Spirit, God can dwell in man. The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit. God is uniquely one, but He is also triune.</p>
