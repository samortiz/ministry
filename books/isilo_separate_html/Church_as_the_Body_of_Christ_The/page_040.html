BEING GOD&rsquo;S THRONE</h2>
<p>Revelation 22 shows the throne of God as the center of the New Jerusalem. Out of this throne proceeds the river of water of life with the function of watering, refreshing, and thirst quenching. The river of water of life flowing out of the throne signifies the flow of life. This means that where God&rsquo;s throne is, there is the flow of life; where God&rsquo;s authority is, there is the flow of life. When the river of water of life flows, it issues in the watering, refreshing, and thirst quenching of life. &ldquo;On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month&rdquo; (v. 2).</p>
<p>From this we can see that every local church should be a place where people are fed, nourished, watered, and satisfied. However, this is not the situation in many local churches, because of the absence of God&rsquo;s throne in that locality. When God&rsquo;s throne is established in a church, life flows. As soon as life flows, there is watering, refreshing, and thirst quenching. When people touch such a church, they touch living water and life, and they are spontaneously satisfied.</p>
<p>The tree of life grows on both sides of the river of water of life, producing twelve fruits each year as its fullness and abundance. The fullness and abundance in a church depend on God&rsquo;s throne and His authority. Only when God is enthroned and rules in a local church can the fullness of God be brought in; enthusiasm and diligence cannot bring in the fullness of God. God&rsquo;s authority brings in life, and life brings in the fullness. If God&rsquo;s throne is absent, the river of water of life will be absent as well. Without the river of water of life, the tree of life is absent, and the abundance of life is also absent. When a local church is full of the fruits of life, producing new fruit every month, the abundance of life will be fully manifested. The abundance of life flows out from the throne.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is only one river and one street in the entire New Jerusalem; both <em>river</em> and <em>street</em> are singular. This unique street, this unique way, runs through the twelve gates, spiraling upward to reach the throne. This is a symbol of the oneness of the church. If there are twelve elders in a local church who do not have the throne of God in their elders&rsquo; meeting, they will have twelve thrones, twelve opinions, and twelve ways. This will be very difficult for the church and will create confusion among the saints. Although there are twelve gates in the New Jerusalem, there is only one street because there is only one throne. The street not only reaches the throne, but it actually comes out from the throne.</p>
<p>Based on this principle, there should be only one throne in a church. All the elders should submit to God&rsquo;s throne and move as one man, one elder. There should not be any personal ideas, opinions, or views, and no one should care for his own idea. Rather, there should be only one way and one authority, God&rsquo;s authority. Such elders do not need to exercise tolerance or to swallow their pride and try to accommodate others, because they are under God&rsquo;s throne and authority, allowing the Holy Spirit to rule among them. These elders can say that all of their decisions are made under the authority of the Holy Spirit. Moreover, everyone in that locality will have a clear way; no one will ever be lost and feel uncertain as to what he should do. There is no need to lead others on this street because the street is the leading. As long as we are on this street, we are under God&rsquo;s throne.</p>
<p>The street and the river of water of life are blended as one. In the middle of the street is the river of water of life, and the tree of life is on both sides of the river (vv. 1-2). Here we have the way to walk, the river of water of life to drink, and the fruit of the tree of life to eat; these three are very rich. This should be the normal condition of a church. People who do not have a way to walk find the way and the leading when they come into the church. People find living water on this street, richly enjoy the fruit of the tree of life, are refreshed and satisfied, and their thirst is quenched. Therefore, all of man&rsquo;s supply and living depend on God&rsquo;s throne.</p>
<p>For this reason, we should ask ourselves, &ldquo;Is God&rsquo;s throne among us and among the responsible brothers? Are we under God&rsquo;s authority? Is there a street with a river of life and a tree of life among God&rsquo;s people?&rdquo; A local church that does not have this condition is not in the principle of the New Jerusalem. There is a throne in the New Jerusalem, and a street proceeds out of this throne; in the middle of the street is a river, and the tree of life grows on both sides of the river, producing twelve fruits. This is a beautiful picture. Therefore, the key to the church life depends entirely on God&rsquo;s throne, God&rsquo;s authority. Although there are many brothers and sisters serving among us, there is only one throne. It is not that you submit to my authority, or that I submit to your authority. It is not that I obey you or that you obey me; rather, the throne, the authority of God, is among us. If there is no throne among the brothers and sisters, it is the same as not having a center. Without a center, everything loses its support and balance, and everything disintegrates and collapses.</p>
<p>The expression of the holy city depends on the throne, the street, the river, and the growth of the tree of life. The condition of the New Jerusalem depends on the throne. If the throne is lost, the entire New Jerusalem will be obliterated. The manifestation of the New Jerusalem has God&rsquo;s throne within and God&rsquo;s glory without. This means that God&rsquo;s authority and God&rsquo;s image are being expressed. In Revelation 4 we see God&rsquo;s throne and God&rsquo;s image; the One sitting on the throne is like a jasper stone in appearance (v. 3). Only when there is the throne can there be the image, and only then can God exercise His authority and be expressed. All blessings are with the throne.</p>
<p>Since the throne is in the New Jerusalem, there will be no more night, only brightness; there will be no more death, only life. The saints will reign in the city forever and ever. We should all realize that the normal condition of a church depends on God&rsquo;s authority. It does not depend on our methods or ideas nor on our enthusiasm or diligence; rather, it depends entirely on God&rsquo;s throne, His authority. May we have God&rsquo;s throne with God&rsquo;s authority among us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
