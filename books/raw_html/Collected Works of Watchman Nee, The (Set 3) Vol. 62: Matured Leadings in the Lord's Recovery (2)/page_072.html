<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY</h1><h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(9)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:March 6, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">THE DEACONS<br />AND THE DEACONS' OFFICE</h2><p>Witness Lee: We need to make some arrangements concerning deacons and the deacons' office. First, we need to make some arrangements about the work of the deacons' office. There are two kinds of people serving in the deacons' office. The first is the person on duty. The fourteen deacons should take turns in this duty. The second is assistants. These are responsible for clerical work.</p><p>There are two requirements for the deacons. First, they must not be afraid of trouble. They should welcome trouble. They are like the businessmen who are not afraid of more customers and more troubles. The deacons must be right in their motives. Some deacons are not right in their motives. When things get complicated and work gets busy, they have a wrong attitude. Second, the deacons cannot do things according to their own ways. They have to work according to the direction of the responsible brothers. If you are a housewife in a family, you are the only person taking care of the work in the house. There is no change of personnel. As such, you can do things absolutely according to your own will. But the work in the church deacons' office is different. You are not the master. If you cannot get through with something, you cannot change it at will. You can fellowship with the responsible ones of the deacons' office, but you cannot change it suddenly.</p><p>The work in the deacons' office must be based on rules and procedures. It should not depend on the whims of individuals. Except for special assignments, everyone should serve according to prearranged instructions. Everything has to be kept in the right place. This will make it easy for the next person to continue with the work.</p><p>A deacon has to be aware of everything around him when he serves in the deacons' office. If a brother or sister comes to you and asks a question, as a serving one on duty you cannot say that you do not know. Even if the brother asks you for a nail, you have to find it immediately, wherever it may be. For every question there may be fifty related questions, and you have to learn them all one by one. In this way you will be clear about everything, and you can answer any question.</p><p>The assistants in the deacons' office must obey the one who is on duty. In the church fellowship meeting, the elders have to explain the relationship of the brothers and sisters to the deacons' office. They should encourage the brothers and sisters to fellowship with the serving ones in the deacons' office. The deacons' office is not under the deacons, but under the elders. Hence, the elders must know everything that is occurring in the deacons' office. They must make sure that all the items of service are taken care of properly. They should not take care of them in the way of control, but in the way of assignment; they should assign the work to the deacons. If they find any preassigned arrangement in the deacons' office improperly done, they should not try to change it right away. Instead, they should inform the responsible ones of the deacons' office and make the changes in fellowship. In principle, if anyone makes a mistake in the deacons' office, the elders cannot make the adjustments themselves; they have to ask those who committed the mistake to adjust it.</p><p>In the fellowship meeting, the elders have to let the brothers and sisters know that the serving ones on duty in the deacons' office are serving on behalf of the church. All the brothers and sisters have to respect these ones. They have to learn to go along absolutely with the arrangements in the deacons' office. When an assignment comes to you from the deacons' office, you have to accept it mechanically; it is not a matter of seeking for leading. You only need to move according to instruction. The serving ones on duty should also occupy themselves with some extra work at ordinary times; they should not be idle in any way.</p>
