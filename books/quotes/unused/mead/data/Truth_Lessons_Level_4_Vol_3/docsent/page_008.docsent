   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. Being Rewarded by the Returning Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Day of the Resurrection of the Righteous</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The believers who work and labor for the Lord will be rewarded by the returning Lord in the day of the resurrection of the righteous Luke 14:14; John 5:29; Rev 20:4-6; 11:18; 1 Cor 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Corinthians 3:14 Paul says that if anyone s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The work that remains must be of gold, silver, and precious stones, the product of faithful ministers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a work will be rewarded by the coming and judging Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This reward is fully related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be rewarded is to be given a rich entrance into the kingdom, that is, to enter into the joy of the Lord and to reign as a co-king with Christ in the enjoyment of eternal life in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Matthew 24:45-47 the Lord Jesus said, Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are blessed if we are faithful toward the Lord and prudent toward the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To give them food is to minister, at the proper time, the Word of God with Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we will be rewarded with the authority to rule in the manifestation of the kingdom, and we will be set over all the possessions of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew 25:21 says, His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Enter into the joy of your master.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that if we are faithful over a few things in this age, the Lord will reward us with ruling authority in the coming kingdom, and we will bear even more responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will also participate in the joy of our Master, that is, the enjoyment of the Lord as our inward satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the greatest reward.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is better than the glory and position in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The believers need to experience the divine dispensing of the Triune God in working and laboring for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They work and labor for the Lord by His resurrection life and power, not by our natural life and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The resurrected Christ has become the life-giving Spirit to bring the processed Triune God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply so that we may live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He lives in us, enabling us to do what we could never do in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our labor for the Lord in His resurrection life with His resurrection power will never be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Resurrection not only encourages us; it also motivates us to do the work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we work and labor for the Lord, we preach Christ as the gospel to sinners by preaching the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not merely teach the word of salvation; we speak a completing word regarding God s revelation concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a healthy word is the truth, the reality of the contents of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to proclaim in season and out of season, that is, whether or not the situation is convenient and whether or not we are welcome.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While working and laboring for the Lord, we should also cast out demons in the name of the Lord and heal the sick by laying hands on them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we should be reminded to not allow casting out demons and healing the sick to surpass the main items of the gospel, which are Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We also have to minister Christ as life to the saints with the nourishing words of the New Testament faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would minister Christ to others, we first must be nourished ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Being nourished with Christ, we will have Christ as food, as the life supply, to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Also, we need to exercise our spirit not merely to pass on knowledge but, while giving forth a certain kind of knowledge, to supply something nourishing to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How wonderful the church life will be if we all do this!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, if the elders shepherd the saints as the flock of God by experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity according to God, that is, according to God s nature, desire, way, and glory, they will be rewarded with the unfading crown of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul reminds us to build up the church with the experiences of the processed Triune God as gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to experience the processed Triune God as these precious materials; then we can build up the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we work and labor for the Lord, sometimes we must pray and fast in order to deal with the power of darkness by casting out demons that insist on remaining.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To pray is mainly to cause our spirit to be exercised so that the ministry of the word may be enlivened and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we work and labor for the Lord in this way, we will be rewarded by the returning Lord in the day of the resurrection of the righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be rewarded is to be given a rich entrance into the kingdom, that is, to enter into the joy of the Lord and to reign as co-kings with Christ in the enjoyment of the eternal life in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>QUESTIONS According to 1 Corinthians 15:10 and Galatians 2:20, by what means should we work and labor for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What causes our labor in the Lord to not be in vain?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What do we preach as the gospel to sinners when we work and labor for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How do we practice casting out demons in the name of the Lord and healing the sick by laying hands on them?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is the main significance of a good minister of Christ Jesus 1 Tim 4:6 ?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What do Paul and Peter say respectively regarding the elders shepherding?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to 1 Corinthians 3:12, how is our experience of the processed Triune God related to the building up of the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why do we need to pray and fast when we work and labor for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What does the Lord promise the believers who work and labor for Him regarding the receiving of a reward?</S>
