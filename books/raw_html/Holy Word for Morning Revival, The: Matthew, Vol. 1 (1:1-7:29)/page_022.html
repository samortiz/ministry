<p class="bold">WEEK 3 — PROPHECY</p><h2 class="uhead1">Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>The King’s ministry (4:12—11:30)	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The beginning of the ministry (4:12-25)</li>	<li>The decree of the kingdom’s constitution (5:1—7:29)		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Concerning the nature of the kingdom people (5:1-12)</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class="uhead1">Crucial Points</h2><p>The beginning of the King’s ministry is covered in Matthew 4:12-25. In His economy God intended to have a thorough change from the old economy to the new. John the Baptist ministered by the riverside, in the wilderness, because he was prepared to bury everyone who came to him in repentance. The newly appointed King began His kingly ministry by the Sea of Galilee, a despised place, far from Jerusalem with its sacred temple, the center of the orthodox religion.</p><p>Peter, Andrew, James, and John were called by the Lord Jesus as a great shining light. They were attracted not by what the Lord Jesus did, but by what He was. No one who follows the Lord because of what He does can be trustworthy or faithful. The trustworthy ones are those who are caught by what the Lord is.</p><p>The Gospel of Matthew, the book on the kingdom of the heavens, has a constitution that is revealed in chapters 5, 6, and 7. The constitution of the kingdom of the heavens is composed of seven sections: 1) the nature of the kingdom people (5:1-12); 2) the influence of the kingdom people upon the world (5:13-16); 3) the law of the kingdom people (5:17-48); 4) the righteous deeds of the kingdom people (6:1-18); 5) the dealing of the kingdom people with riches (6:19-34); 6) the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others (7:1-12); and 7) the ground of the kingdom people’s living and work (7:13-29).</p><p>The kingdom of the heavens is a specific term used by Matthew, indicating that the kingdom of the heavens differs from the kingdom of God, the term used in the other three Gospels. The kingdom of God refers to God’s reign in a general way from eternity past to eternity future. The kingdom of the heavens is a special section within the kingdom of God, composed only of the church today and the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom.</p><p>According to Matthew, there are three aspects concerning the kingdom of the heavens: the reality (chs. 5—7), the appearance (ch. 13), and the manifestation (chs. 23—24). Specifically, the reality is the inward contents in its heavenly and spiritual nature; the appearance is the outward state in name; and the manifestation is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power.</p><p>The first section of the constitution (5:1-12) reveals the nature of the kingdom people. The kingdom people are the overcomers. To be an overcomer is not something special; it is to be normal. These verses describe nine aspects of the nature of the kingdom people. They are poor in spirit, mourning for the present situation, meek in suffering opposition, hungry and thirsty for righteousness, merciful toward others, pure in heart, making peace with all men, suffering persecution for righteousness, and suffering being reproached and evil spoken of. The kingdom of the heavens is firstly related to our spirit (v. 3). We must see that for the kingdom of the heavens we must be poor in spirit, fully emptied in our spirit, that we may receive Christ. Also, we need to be pure in heart (v. 8), single in purpose that Christ may grow in us without hindrance or frustration. If we have Christ, we have the kingdom of the heavens. If we live Christ, then the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is ours. Thus, the real blessing is Christ with His kingdom.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p>
