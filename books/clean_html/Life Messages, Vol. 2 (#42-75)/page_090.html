<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:4, 6b, 14; Gal. 5:25; Rev. 22:14, 17; Eph. 6:18; Rev. 1:10a; 1 Thes. 5:17, 19</h1><h2 class=head1>THE ULTIMATE REVELATION OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>After incarnation, God Himself lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years. He then went to the cross and passed through death. He was resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God. Today the Spirit as the Lord is on the throne and is also moving on earth, waiting for man to receive Him. Whoever repents, calls upon the Lord, and believes in Him will receive this wonderful Spirit and be mingled with Him as one. This mingling of man with the Triune God is the mystery of mysteries in the universe.<h2 class=head1>QUALIFIED</h2><p>In resurrection this One is complete and qualified in every way. He is the Creator. He is the Redeemer. He is both God and man; thus He has both divinity and humanity. By virtue of His having passed through death and entered into resurrection, He has within Him both the power of death and of resurrection. He has the ascension glory, the authority, and the power. He is on the throne, with both the kingdom and the glory belonging to Him. All the power of the universe is embodied in Him. We rightly call Him all-inclusive!<p>When you receive Him, this very Spirit comes into you, making you one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This One, with the power of resurrection, is in your spirit. What a joyous fact it is that we are one with this all-inclusive Christ! In Him are all the riches—humanity, divinity, power, life, holiness, and glory. They are for us now, not sometime in the future.<p>What is our part? It is simply to walk according to this Spirit. To do this is other than religion, ethics, morality, or culture. What a glorious salvation! To walk according to this all-inclusive Spirit is the essence of the whole Bible. All sixty-six books, whatever they seemingly cover, have this as their ultimate direction; they were written for this end result.<p>If you are invited to someone’s home for a meal, the kitchen will be a very busy place. The vegetables have to be washed and cut. The meat has to be sliced and seasoned. There may be water boiling on the stove. The oil must be heated for the things that are fried. If you look into the kitchen, you will see how much activity is going on and how messy everything appears. There may be smoke and steam in the air from the cooking. Eventually, however, a meal of delicious food will be placed before you for your enjoyment.<p>This kitchen activity may be likened to the process that God went through in order to be a delicious meal for us. He created the world. He became incarnate. He passed through human living. Then He entered and passed through death. Bidding death farewell, He entered into resurrection. At this point the meal was ready! When we repent and believe in the Lord Jesus, this delicious dish becomes our portion. All He would have us do is enjoy this Spirit as our portion.<p>This Spirit is both the breath of life and the tree of life in Genesis 2. The tree of life is simply the processed Triune God, who has become the Spirit and is now before you to eat and enjoy. After you receive Him, you are to eat of Him and enjoy Him.
