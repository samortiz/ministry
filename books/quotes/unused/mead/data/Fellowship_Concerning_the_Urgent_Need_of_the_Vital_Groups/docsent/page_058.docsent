   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO BECOMING VITAL THROUGH PRAYER,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PREPARING OUR GOSPEL CANDIDATES, AND REDEEMING OUR TIME TO LEARN THE TRUTH BECOMING VITAL THROUGH PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we have to start our action for the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Recently I visited a group of saints, and I made a very positive discovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I found out that they were not vital and that they do not pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They have not gotten into the prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The only way that we can touch the Spirit is by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible the Spirit is linked with our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Praying and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are without prayer, we will be without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, we can also say that without the Spirit, there can be no prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why we are told that we have to pray in spirit Eph 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since we are regenerated believers in Christ, our human spirit and the Holy Spirit are mingled together as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not pray even for one day, we have the feeling that we are short of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we pray, even with just a few sentences, we have the feeling that we are touching the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all need to have a time with the Lord every morning in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you do not pray in the morning for one week, you will be dead spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no other way to be vital except by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to pray and get into a prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most of us are living in a situation in which it is difficult to find a solid time of half an hour to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever we set aside a definite time to pray, the enemy will always try to disturb us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we begin to pray, someone may knock on our door or call us on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may not have any telephone calls for a long period of time, but as soon as we begin to pray, the telephone will ring.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, after three phone calls, our heart for prayer may be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may have to wait for a period of time until we can be recovered back to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not easy for us to pray for half an hour without being disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to look to the Lord so that we can free ourselves from all distractions to have solid times of prayer with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Prayer makes us vital.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to take the lead to be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are not vital, we cannot pray for others to be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be vital means to be released in the spirit, and this cannot be performed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we pray for half an hour, we will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are not released, we are not vital.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To contact people we have to be released persons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are not bound, we will be able to release others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A dejected, weeping person cannot make other people happy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are going to make people happy, we have to be happy persons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can only help people to be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to go out to effectively labor in the gospel, we must be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>PREPARING OUR GOSPEL CANDIDATES</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before going out, we must have some preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, we must prepare some candidates for us to go to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to consider all of our relatives, neighbors, classmates, colleagues, and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Out of these ones whom we know, we need to choose some to labor on for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course, we have to do this by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should pray, Lord, who are the best two or three right now for me to work on?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I shared in a previous message that we all should make a list of the people we know who need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we read this list prayerfully, we will have some kind of inner registration of the two or three whom we should labor on now.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to consider their situation and labor on them appropriately.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to consider all of our acquaintances, and we need the proper discernment in our consideration of whom we should labor on.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should spend our time to labor on those whom we consider to be promising and not waste our time on others who are not open.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In our group meetings we should pray and study our candidates for the gospel together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to consider people s condition, especially spiritually, and then act appropriately to meet their need in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to decide how we should visit a certain person and who would be the right one or ones to go.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>LEARNING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>AND LEARNING THE PROPER WAY</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>TO PRESENT THE TRUTH TO GAIN PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How you talk to a person is crucial, and how you answer his questions is more crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Your word may save him, or it could delay him for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A person may have a question, and although you may speak many things from the Bible to answer him, he will not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If a person asks you what eternal life is, you should not answer him in a complicated way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You should answer him strictly and simply.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You may say, Eternal life is God Himself, and God is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, eternal life is just Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today Christ is the Spirit with us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is waiting for a time to enter into you to be your eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Would you receive Him?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then he may ask, By what way?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then you can lead him to pray and call upon the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Within a short time this person will be helped to know what eternal life is, who is eternal life, and how he can receive this life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Eternal life is God, God today is Jesus Christ, and He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By praying and calling upon the name of the Lord we can receive Him into us to be our very life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we go to visit someone, we should not speak too many points to him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Otherwise, he will be complicated and receive nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we go to visit someone and speak many points to him in a complicating way, our speaking will delay him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He may feel that the things in the Bible are too hard to understand, and his interest will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then he will not want to have any further contact with us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This will delay him for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should be in fear and trembling when we contact people 1 Cor 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should pray, Lord, how should I answer this person?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Help me.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You also need to know the proper Bible verses, especially those verses which are referred to as golden verses.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Surely you have to remember John 3:16, but in John 3 there are other crucial verses.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Verses 3 and 5 speak of being born anew, being regenerated, to enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You need to know the best verses concerning God, concerning Christ, concerning Christ s blood, concerning Christ s redemption, and concerning all the crucial truths related to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Your answers to people should be concise and to the point.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is somewhat simple for me to coach you, but for you to do it is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This needs your practice.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In our vital group meetings, we need to spend some time to study our gospel candidates.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>After we go to contact a person, the following week we should give a report in the group meeting of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then we should look to the Lord and fellowship about how to take the next step with this person.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We must remember that in our gospel labor we are fishers of men Matt 4:19 , and human society is like a big ocean full of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Certain fish may be very hard to catch, so we should not spend our time on them.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We need to go to the fish that are available for us to catch.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is why we need the proper discernment concerning whom we should labor on.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God surely loves everyone, but I am not talking about God loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I am speaking about how to hook people with the limited amount of time available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must have something to meet people s need.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If a person goes to a store to buy something, and the store does not carry what he wants, he will go away unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But if he finds a store that carries what he needs, he will surely be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must have something to meet people s need.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Furthermore, we may have something, but do we know how to present what we have?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We need to learn to present things to people in a way that they can receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We should learn to present the truth of the gospel according to the practical situation of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This requires our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>To become proficient in any kind of athletic endeavor, a person must practice all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Our success in reaching people with the gospel for the increase of the Body of Christ all depends upon our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I hope that we will get ourselves prepared to come to the following group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We need to come prepared with the gospel candidates whom we feel we should labor on.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Then we can consider how to go to them and begin our labor together in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>When we labor on certain ones, we must be consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We should not hope that within three months someone will be saved and within another half year another one will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>It may be that the three for whom we are burdened will not be saved until two years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In the past we may have been very busy, but we did not bear any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We must pray to get a few definite candidates.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Then we need to work on them.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We need to learn how to concentrate our work in order to get some definite results.</S>
