   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's plan and purpose are fulfilled through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The center of the church is the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows us the importance of the position of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The management of the elders in a church is a matter that should not be underestimated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Due to my ignorance in the matter, I have served as a misguided elder for over twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was not until 1960 when I attended Brother Witness Lee's training that I heard for the first time the secret to the elders' management of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These lessons are the culmination of Brother Lee's many years of practical experience and involvement in church management based on biblical principles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The subjects covered are definite, detailed, and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They were first used by the church in Peitou, which studied these lessons twice in their service meetings and witnessed rich results.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Last January, Hall One of the church in Taipei made mimeographed copies of notes of these meetings and studied them in the responsible brothers' meetings throughout all the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They left a deep impression on the brothers and brought about very much progress in their service and coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Recently after Brother Chang Wu-cheng and I visited twenty-four local churches throughout the province, we felt that the study of the elders' management of the church is a desperate need of the churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I take the opportunity of the publishing of this book to encourage all my co-elders to study these lessons together with the responsible ones of their districts and to practice these lessons together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This will render great help to the management of the church, to the coordination of the elders and the deacons, and to the producing of useful people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this, the Lord will gain a more open way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May the Lord accomplish this aspiration!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Chang Yu-lan in Taipei</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>July, 1963</S>
