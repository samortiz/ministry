   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the participation in the Divine Trinity in Their oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their oneness becomes our oneness, and as They coinhere, we coinhere with Them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By all the preceding points we can see that the Gospel of John is a book on the dispensing of the Triune God and the receiving of this dispensing by the believers through their breathing, eating, and drinking of Him and their abiding in Him.</S>
