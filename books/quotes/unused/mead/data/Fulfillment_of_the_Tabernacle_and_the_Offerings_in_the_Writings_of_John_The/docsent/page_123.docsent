   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR THE SIGNS IN JOHN THIRTEEN 2 Scripture Reading: John 13:1-38</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we saw that before the Lord Jesus washed His disciples' feet, He realized that the Father had given all things and all people into His hands, that He had come forth from God, and that He was going to God 13:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have also seen that the commission the Lord Jesus received from the Father was to bring fallen mankind into God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord was about to wash His disciples' feet, they had not yet been brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, they were still at the altar in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They had not yet come into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to come into the tabernacle, they needed the washing of their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a hymn that speaks of passing the outer court, the outer veil, and the inner veil Hymns, #551 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is related to the tabernacle and the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The outer veil was the veil at the entrance to the Holy Place, and the inner veil was the veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, this inner veil was torn from the top to the bottom Matt 27:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spiritually speaking, in chapter thirteen of John the disciples were neither in the Holy of Holies nor in the Holy Place; they were still in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their sins and sin had been dealt with by the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, because they were still unclean due to the earthly touch, they needed the washing of the laver before they could enter the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without this washing, certain frustrations or hindrances would have remained.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, there was the need for all earthly defilement to be washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This defilement is removed by foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>ONE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have seen that in washing His disciples' feet, the Lord loved them to the uttermost v. 1 . The purpose of foot-washing was to keep the disciples in constant fellowship with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Apart from foot-washing, there is no way for this fellowship to be maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the church life often there are problems between the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>None of us can say that he has never had a problem with another saint in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we may have problems with one another, we may try to act polite.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if the problems are not dealt with, they will eventually become problems between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not think that a problem you have with a brother is simply a problem between you and him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If that problem is not taken care of, it will become a problem between you and God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, having a problem with a brother may hinder you from praying properly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This problem between you and the brother keeps you out of God; that is, it keeps you outside the tabernacle and at the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By this we see that even a small problem with a brother can keep us from entering the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we need the washing in the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not have the washing, both our fellowship with the brothers and our fellowship with God will be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot maintain our fellowship with God if the fellowship with our brothers is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to be impressed with the fact that there are not two fellowships.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is not one fellowship with God and a different fellowship with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No, our fellowship with the brothers is actually part of our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we should not regard our fellowship with God as one thing and our fellowship with the brothers as another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This fellowship is absolutely one matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, if our fellowship with our brothers is broken, that means our fellowship with the Father is also broken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At least, one link of this fellowship is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order for our fellowship with God to be broken, it is not necessary that every link be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is enough that just one link is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By this we see that a problem with a brother or sister can cause our fellowship with God to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A problem with another saint hinders us from entering the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever our fellowship has been broken, we need foot-washing in order to recover this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may not have any problem with God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But you may have a problem with God indirectly through the problem you have with your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The problem with your brother also becomes a problem between you and God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that we need foot-washing in order to maintain our fellowship with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Day by day, we all need foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, many Christians do not realize what the significance of foot-washing is.</S>
