   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTENTS OF THE ARK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the holy place there are three main things: firstly, Christ is the bread upon the table; secondly, He is the light from the lampstand; and thirdly, He is the sweet incense, the acceptance to God, from the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 9:4 tells us that in the holiest of all, within Christ as the ark, there are also three things: the hidden manna, corresponding to the bread; the hidden law which enlightens us, corresponding to the light; and the hidden rod, sprouting with almond blossoms, corresponding to the incense of the golden altar in the matter of acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only Aaron was acceptable to God; therefore Aaron's rod sprouted with almond blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The almond blossoms signify resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that God accepted him in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the holy place everything is open, but in the ark everything is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the holy place the bread was called the showbread, signifying something openly displayed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in the ark it becomes the hidden manna, something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the holy place there was the lampstand with the light shining forth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in the ark the law was hidden, which signifies the law speaking in a hidden and deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From the incense altar the fragrance ascended outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in the ark the sprouting rod was hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The experience of the ark in the holiest of all is much deeper than the experience of the things in the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is also proved by the ark being overlaid with gold within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both the showbread table and the incense altar were overlaid with gold only on the outward side.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That means that the overlaying of gold was to a lesser degree and more shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The overlaying of gold upon the ark is greater and deeper, signifying that the experience of Christ here is greater and deeper than before.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose we meet two new Christians who have just been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have both experienced Christ as their living bread, and they love to come to the meetings and show Him forth to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They testify: "Oh, we have enjoyed Christ so much this week!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Two sisters who were baptized with them are shining with the light they have received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They also testify and shine forth in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All four have experienced Christ in the holy place, and now they express Him publicly in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the Apostle Paul were to attend the same meeting, however, I do not think that you would so easily recognize him as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He would sit there quietly with no outward display.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if you were to converse with him later you would be amazed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You would wonder where on earth he came from.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Something within him is so rich, so hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You could not observe so much outwardly, for with him, everything is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The priests in the holy place must dress the lampstand in the morning and light it in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But there is no need to attend thus to the hidden law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is always there speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The new sisters who are so brightly shining in the meetings may appear next week with gloomy countenances.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are yet so shallow in their experience of Christ; they need a priest to dress and lighten them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the holiest of all with the ark we enjoy God in Christ as the hidden manna, as the divine, regulating law, and as the sprouting rod with resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we experience God in Christ in such a deep and rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He becomes so real and rich to us as the hidden manna, the hidden law, and the hidden resurrection power within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the uttermost experience of Christ, the very climax of spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At this point, we are fully and wholly mingled with God; we are overlaid with God as the gold in everything and in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The two natures, divinity and humanity, are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE DIMENSIONS OF THE ARK</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The dimensions of the ark are completely in half-sizes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The size of the brass altar was five by five by three cubits Exo 27:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The ark, however, is two and a half, by one and a half, by one and a half cubits Exo 25:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Its dimensions are one half those of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is the significance of this?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we see a half of a watermelon, we automatically surmise that there must be another half somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In principle, this is the meaning of the ark of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A testimony requires two witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The ark needs another "half."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, the ark's dimensions of half sizes impart the meaning of testimony.</S>
