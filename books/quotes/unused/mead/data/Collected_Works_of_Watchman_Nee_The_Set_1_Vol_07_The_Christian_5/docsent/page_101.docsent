   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A holy man surely hates sin, and it is natural for him to condemn sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sin of adultery is so evil!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How could the holy Lord not criticize this sin!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet He said, "Neither do I condemn you."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What love!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What forgiveness!</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We seem to have a natural ability to criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Weak brothers inevitably make mistakes and have many flaws in their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In these cases, we should have the forgiving spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Lord can forgive and not condemn them, should we not take the same attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Indeed, God forgives men more readily than we forgive men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a sad fact that the saints are the quickest to condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May we be as merciful as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are not filled with the love of Golgotha and not melted by His love, we can never "love one another."</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord remind us all the time of these words: "Neither do I condemn you."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, there is one word which we would say to those who are unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the age of grace the Lord Jesus will not condemn man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the day will come when the words of grace that He said on earth will condemn you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Come quickly and receive Him as your Savior!</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A Christian should have the continual experience of abiding with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we pray for a deeper experience of crucifixion with the Lord, that is, for a deeper union with His death, and to be without the self, He will cause all kinds of despising and rejection to come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By that time, we should not feel sorry for ourselves, but should praise the Lord, because He is using these things to accomplish what we have asked for, which is to be free from ourselves.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not consider how much we have given up for the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I would rather see myself making mistakes, and confessing my own untrustworthiness, and turning away from trusting in myself, than to see my own goodness and praise myself in private for being trustworthy in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Lord, whenever I think that I deserve any merit or trust, may You cause what I consider trustworthy to fail!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In this way, when You have perfected me to the point where I will make no more mistakes, I will not dare to uplift my "self" before the Lord and before men, and I will not any longer trust in my "self."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I would rather that others see me not zealous, than to have the Lord see me zealous outside of His will.</S>

   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Once a few of us were under an oak tree comparing notes and considering the best method to work.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In particular, we discussed the most effective way to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>One of my friends said, "I always write down my sermons and edit them carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If there is anything that would offend any of my audience, I would erase it right away."</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This was the word of a young pastor who was very eager that others would recognize him.</S>

   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>To consider the sufferings in one's environments is a proof that there is too much self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>We should not commend others for their goodness, for their goodness may be something natural that is from the flesh.</S>

   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>We should not consider others' shortcomings, for that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and he that is of the flesh cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>If this is the case, what should we consider?</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>We should consider what the Lord's hand has done in a person, and how the Lord's grace has operated in a person.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>If we do this, what we see, what we commend, and what we praise will be the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>We will not deny the Lord's name, nor will we veil His glory.</S>

   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>Such a person should not only rejoice in the fact that God's power matches his encounters, but also in the fact that such difficulties many times manifest God's power, and turn them into open and wonderful things.</S>

   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>In our experience, "to try" means "to fail."</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>God cannot, will not, and does not bless those who live in disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>We see that the way the apostles work is not through many ways and means, but through themselves going out, and trusting in His sure word: "Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you" Matt 6:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>Selfishness will corrupt a person, but obedience will lead to blessing.</S>
