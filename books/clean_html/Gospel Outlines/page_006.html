<li>Satan&rsquo;s temptation<br />
<span class="normal">In this section you need to describe the passage in Genesis 3:1-6; how Satan hid himself in a serpent and tempted man by subtle and tricky words which caused man to question God, God&rsquo;s heart, God&rsquo;s work, and God&rsquo;s word. All these questions were like a fog that trapped man and led him astray.</span></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s doubt<br />
<span class="normal">Once man was tempted and accepted Satan&rsquo;s words, right away he began to doubt God, God&rsquo;s heart, God&rsquo;s work, and God&rsquo;s word.</span></li>
<li>Man was deceived<br />
<span class="normal">When man was deceived, Satan&rsquo;s temptation had succeeded.</span>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although man sinned willingly, by the choice of his free will, nevertheless, man was cheated by Satan.</li>
	<li>So the New Testament says that the serpent deceived Eve (2 Cor. 11:3), that is, Satan used trickery to deceive the human race.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The result of being deceived
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>There was the sense of guilt.</li>
	<li>Right away man escaped from God&rsquo;s presence and did not dare see God.</li>
	<li>Man found excuses. Indeed man had sinned, but he would not admit it.</li>
	<li>Man was judged.</li>
	<li>Man fell into death.<br />
	According to how Satan tempted Eve&mdash;how Eve accepted Satan&rsquo;s words and doubted God, God&rsquo;s heart, God&rsquo;s work, and God&rsquo;s words&mdash;explain how men today are still under the same deception with the same results.</li>
