   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO KINDS OF ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Exodus 29 the anointing oil is mentioned first in verse 7 and again in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 7 says, And you shall take the anointing oil and pour it upon his head and anoint him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This refers to the anointing of Aaron before any of the offerings were slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Aaron himself was anointed apart from the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a type of the anointing of Christ mentioned in Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this psalm the ointment was poured upon Aaron s head and eventually ran down to the skirts of his garments.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This signifies the anointing of Christ by God apart from redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ s anointing, of course, did not require the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Aaron was anointed not only as a type of Christ, but also as a sinful person who was being sanctified to serve God as a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because Aaron and his sons were sinful, there was the need for a second kind of anointing, an anointing with the anointing oil and the sprinkling of the redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, regarding this anointing, the blood is mentioned first.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that we must first have the redeeming blood, and then we can participate in the anointing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The blood of the peace offering is somewhat complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we have seen, there are three steps, three applications: first, the blood applied to the ear, the thumb, and the big toe of the priests; second, the blood sprinkled upon the altar; and third, the blood with the anointing oil sprinkled upon the priests garments.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PEACE OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 22 and 23 say, And you shall take from the ram the fat, and the fat; tail, and the fat that covers the inwards, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them. and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of the filling of hand; and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread which is before Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The parts of the ram mentioned here are the richest and sweetest parts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to verses 24 and 25 these parts, along with a loaf of bread, a cake of oiled bread, and a wafer from a basket of unleavened bread, were burned on the altar upon the burnt offering for a sweet savor before Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The inward parts and the fat were all burned to be God s food.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is confirmed in Leviticus 3:11 and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The main outward parts of the second ram were the breast and the shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The right shoulder, the inward parts, and the fat were burned, along with the three cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The right breast was waved before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a wave offering, a type of Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This right breast which was waved before God was not burned; instead, it was given to Moses to be his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The left breast and the left shoulder were the portions for Aaron and his sons to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The shoulder was heaved, exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This heave offering typifies Christ in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ in resurrection is the wave offering, and Christ in ascension is the heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The breast of the peace offering signifies love, and the shoulder signifies strength.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Christ in resurrection is of love, and the Christ in ascension is of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the New Testament the ascension signifies strength and power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The ascended Christ is a Christ of power and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To repeat, the right shoulder was burned for God, and the right breast was first waved before God and then given to Moses to be his portion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both the left shoulder and the left breast were heaved up before God and then given to Aaron and his sons to be their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In forthcoming messages we shall cover these matters in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From what we have covered thus far, we see that we need Christ to be our sin offering, to be the ram as our burnt offering for God s satisfaction, and to be our peace offering, with all its aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Part of the peace offering is for God s satisfaction, and part is for the ministering priests.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As priests, we may enjoy our part of the peace offering along with the bread.</S>
