<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING GOD'S THINGS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Col. 3:4, 11; John 8:24, 28</h1><p>If all that a Christian knows is that he has embraced the Christian faith and that this is a noble thing to do, I do not believe that such a person can go on in a good way. This thought may be noble, but only in a negative sense. What we need is light in a positive sense.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST OUR LIFE</h2><p>A Christian who does not know that Christ is his life does not know what reality is. Unless a man receives God's light and sees the things in Christ, he is like a blind man who is oblivious to all the physical objects around him. Those in the world only know the things of the world, and we call them the unbelievers. But if a Christian only knows the "things" in Christ, such as love, work, virtues, etc., he will still be short of God's standard. These things resemble Christ and are actually very close to Christ, but they are merely things. Too few Christians today are after Christ Himself. Most of them are after the things of Christ. These things have filled their whole being. However, many other Christians can testify from their own experience that the things they once treasured have turned out to be nothing but dead "things."</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE THINGS THAT<br />CHRISTIANS CONSIDER IMPORTANT</h2><p>There are certain things that Christians consider very important. Without these things, they seem to feel that they can no longer be Christians. If you remove these things from them, they will feel that they are no longer Christians. They will feel very strange when a person calls himself a Christian yet does not have these things.</p><h2 class="head2">Experience</h2><p>There are two kinds of Christian experiences. Some experiences are Christ, while other experiences are things. With the latter, you cannot say that Christ is not in the experience, but neither can you say that Christ is the experience. Many experiences begin as Christ but end up as things. Many experiences are part Christ and part things. The same is true with many works and behaviors&mdash;they are part Christ and part things. How can one say that an experience is all Christ, without any trace of "things"? Many experiences of Christ were real the first time a person experienced them; they were living, but they have become dead.</p><p>In the eyes of the Lord experience should not be limited by time. There is no past tense in spiritual things. Some testify, saying, "On such-and-such a date, the Lord led me a certain way, and I experienced certain things." If you check with them again whether or not they really had such an experience on that certain date, they confidently say "yes." But those who testify about their own experience are only testifying about things; they are not testifying about Christ. These things might have been Christ at the time they experienced them, but they have become things. In our testimony, we should say, "On such-and-such a date, I experienced Christ for the first time." This means that we have continued to experience Christ. When some people testify about their salvation, they feel they have the Lord's presence. Yet they are only testifying about a thing or an event.</p><p>Many people come to us with a hope. They see others receiving a revelation, and they hope to have the same. Eventually, they become disappointed. Those who hope to find do not find, because their hope rests on a thing. The Lord does not give us things. He does not intend to give man merely things. Many people do not ask for the Lord Himself; they merely ask the Lord to do something for them. When the thing is done, the Lord is set aside. They want the Lord to visit them and give them the things that are spoken of in others' testimonies. They want the experiences for the sake of giving good testimonies, not for the sake of gaining Christ.</p><p>Only those who seek after the Lord alone will see; those who seek for experience will not see. In fact, only those who seek after the Lord will have the experience; those who seek after the experience will not find it. Those who seek after the Lord will have the experience of Romans 6; those who seek for the experience of Romans 6 will not find it. They may be able to speak and pray about it, but they will not have the experience of it.</p>
