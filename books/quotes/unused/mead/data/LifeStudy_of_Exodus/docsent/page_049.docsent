   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Issue of the Conflict 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Israel Suffering More Cruelty</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the issue of the conflict caused by God s demand and Pharaoh s resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first aspect of the issue was that Israel suffered more cruelty 5:10-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The greater the conflict, the more God s chosen people suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the enemy s strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think, however, that increased suffering is a negative sign.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, it is a positive sign, for it indicates that God s negotiation with the enemy is taking place and that we are affected by it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our suffering is a sign that God is in the process of delivering us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moses Being Bothered and Discouraged</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verses 22 and 23 indicate that Moses was bothered and discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moses even asked the Lord why He had sent him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, Moses said to Him, Neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of us have had similar experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we ministered Christ to others, the more they suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This caused us to become troubled and discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our concept is that if we minister in a proper way, others will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We expect the dead to be resurrected, the sick to be healed, the weak to be strengthened, and the poor to be enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the situation is often the opposite of what we anticipate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I can testify of this strongly from my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many times I have been disappointed, just as Moses was.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes I went to the Lord and said, Lord, what happened?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You told me to minister this matter to Your people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It seems to me that You should bless them and put Your seal upon my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the more I minister to the people, the more difficulty they have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, am I wrong in some way?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I don t understand what is happening.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jehovah God Reconfirming His Name</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>and His Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After Moses expressed his discouragement and bewilderment to the Lord, Jehovah God came in to reconfirm His name and His covenant 6:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God said to Moses, I am Jehovah: And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God All-sufficient; but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers 6:2-4, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is more precious than the reconfirmation of God s name and His covenant?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By God s reconfirmation, Moses was strengthened and encouraged both to go back to Pharaoh and to speak again to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In brief, the Lord s name is what He Himself is, and His covenant is His word spoken with a promise and confirmed with an oath.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A word spoken in an ordinary way is not a covenant, but a word spoken with a promise and confirmed with an oath becomes a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>See Life-study of Hebrews, Message Thirty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God spoke to Abraham; then He spoke with a promise concerning the good land, a promise that was confirmed again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Finally, there was an oath, so that there was an agreement, a contract, made by God between God Himself and Abraham; the promising word of God became a covenant Gen 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Circumcision was a token of this covenant Gen 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today we may experience God s reconfirming His name and His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes after I have complained to the Lord, He has confirmed His name to me with the reminder that He is the I Am, the unique self-existing One.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At such times of reconfirmation, the Lord seems to say, I can never fail.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I mean whatever I say.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am, but the sufferings are not.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not believe in your situation believe in what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In such times God also reconfirms His covenant to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Israel Not Hearkening unto Moses</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 6:6-8 the Lord gave Moses some very encouraging words to speak to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He wanted Moses to tell them that He would bring them out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, redeem them with an outstretched arm, take them to Him for a people, and bring them into the land which He promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nevertheless, verse 9 says, And Moses spoke so unto the children of Israel; but they hearkened not unto Moses from shortness of spirit, and from cruel bondage Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Their spirit had been exhausted by their sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, they would not regard God s word to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In their shortness of spirit, God s people were like a car without gasoline.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we are short of spirit, we cannot bear any kind of bondage or suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, we need to pray that our spirit will be preserved and supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to ask the Lord to keep us from ever being short of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this message we have seen the conflict between God and God s enemy, Pharaoh, who symbolizes Satan objectively and the Satan-possessed and usurped self subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God wants us to take a three days journey into the wilderness so that we may hold a feast unto Him and sacrifice to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But Satan and the self rise up to deny God and to refuse to let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Nevertheless, because of the Lord s full salvation, many of us have been delivered from bondage in Egypt and are now in the wilderness enjoying the feast and offering sacrifice to our God.</S>
