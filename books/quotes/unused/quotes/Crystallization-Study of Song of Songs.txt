1) Attracted by Christ's love, charmed by His name, and captivated by His person to pursue Him and be led into the church life
Many people do not realize that God also created us with a seeking heart for Himself so that He could be our satisfaction
Man fell away from God, and sin through Satan came in to frustrate man from receiving God for his satisfaction
The monks in Buddhism and the nuns in Catholicism have this desire, but they do not have the proper understanding of how to seek God
There is no other way except by pursuing after Christ, because Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God
He is God in reality, God's embodiment, coming to earth to give people the opportunity to receive Him for satisfaction
Eventually, both Peter, a fisherman, and Paul, a learned scholar, found the way to seek Christ for satisfaction
To believe in Him is to receive Him as the divine life into us that we may have an organic union with God in the divine life
According to the New Testament, after we believe in Christ, after we receive Him as the divine life into us, we have to love Him
Someone who is affectionate with another may kiss him on the cheek, but this expression of affection is not the first category of love
In her desire to be kissed with the kisses of His mouth, the seeker goes on to say, 'For your love is better than wine'
Verse 3 says, 'Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; / Your name is like ointment poured forth; / Therefore the virgins love you'
Christ's name signifies Christ's person, His being, and Christ is the compound Spirit signified by the anointing ointment in Exodus 30
At least these six things are compounded together to be the anointing ointment, signifying Christ in His resurrection as the compound Spirit
Recently, we have stressed that God became a man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead
As those who have been born of God, we are the children of God, the same as God in life and nature but not in the Godhead
They portray God merely as great, almighty, sovereign, majestic, and even unapproachable; no one can or even dares to touch God
When they entered into the tomb, an angel gave them a message from the Lord, saying, 'Go, tell His disciples and Peter '
Captivated by His beauty, Worthy tribute haste to bring; Let His peerless worth constrain thee, Crown Him now unrivaled King
Many say that Jesus came to express God, but they mainly refer to the miracles He did, not to the tears that He shed
Dear saints, my burden in this message is to share that you have to start seeking the Lord in a personal and affectionate way
When the other ten heard this, they were indignant, showing that they also were ambitious to be with the Lord on the throne
Today Christ visits us privately and spiritually because He is the life-giving, compound, consummated, all-inclusive Spirit
He is the Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, so He visits people secretly, privately, not openly
God created man that man may become Him by His being received by man so that He can enter into and stay in man
Regretfully, the majority of Christians in today's Christianity do not believe that there is such a thing as the human spirit
The Chinese translation of the Bible mixes up the heart, the soul, and the spirit by using the terms 'spirit-soul' or 'heart-spirit'
Christ as the life-giving Spirit dwells in our human spirit, and these two spirits are mingled together to be one spirit
Christ the King brings His seekers into His chambers, that is into their regenerated spirit, His dwelling place
According to our experience, our spirit is the Holy of Holies-the dwelling place, the inner chambers, of the Triune God
After we were saved we began to pray and eventually we realized that the heavenly Father, the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit are all in us
We did not know that we had a human spirit, but gradually we found out that the Triune God dwells in our regenerated spirit
The seeker followed the Lord, and He immediately brought her to her regenerated spirit to have fellowship with Him
She says, 'I am black but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon'
The black tents of Kedar were dried up by the sun, but the lovely curtains of Solomon were within the king's home
In her fellowship with the Lord, she was enlightened to see that she was a sinner in Adam but that she has been justified in Christ
She was instructed by Christ to leave the place where she was kept away from the church and go forth on the footsteps of the flock
Many do not even like to talk about the church because of all the complications and confusion with the denominations
Her brothers born of the same grace persecuted her and pressed her to work in the vineyards while she neglected her own vineyard
The so-called churches set up by them are not the church in the proper sense according to the apostles' teaching in the New Testament
Many missionaries who went to China were the genuine companions of Christ, but they set up their own denominations
They were very good with respect to Christ but they did something wrong with respect to the church life because they set up their own flocks
All the so-called Christian churches built up by Christ's companions bring people to Christ, but only to a certain extent
Although they were very spiritual, they were still not up to the Lord's standard according to the apostles' teaching in the New Testament
We must have our spiritual children stay in the places where these shepherds are; this is the best blessing to our children
Eventually, Egypt became a world power, and the children of Abraham lived there for more than four hundred years
Today those in the United Nations know only the evil world, which is built up by Satan mingled with the fallen life of man
In the spiritual world many unseen things take place in and with us that no one in the physical world can understand
Everything in the physical world from Cain through Nimrod and through Antichrist will be burned in the lake of fire
Because we want to enjoy His rich presence with His rest and satisfaction, He tells us clearly that He is only with His flock, the church
We have to learn to say that our concern is God's concern for the church, for the Body of Christ, and for the New Jerusalem
When we fellowship with Christ privately and spiritually, He will direct our feet to go forth on the footsteps of the flock
2 Corinthians 3:18 says that we are to be transformed into the image of the glory of Christ by the Lord Spirit
The first conference of the Lord's recovery in the United States was on the all-inclusive Christ, based upon three verses from Deuteronomy 8
Stanza 6 of Hymns 548 says Transformation is my need To be broken more indeed That the clay may change in form To the treasure to conform
One is Satan's cosmos, Satan's satanic system, to systematize all the fallen people into his hands to form his kingdom
God came in and scattered the rebellious ones at Babel, but He had not yet terminated the evil cosmos of Satan
The children of Abraham, God's chosen people, went down to Egypt and stayed there for more than four hundred years
While Satan is building up the world, his cosmos, by his satanic trinity , God is working in His Divine Trinity to build up another world
Among the many people who became flesh are those chosen and predestinated by God before the foundation of the world
The Creator, the Almighty God, was on this earth living in His human shell as a little man to visit many people
The Jews thought that Jesus was finished, but after three days this finished Jesus came out in resurrection in a transformed form
Jesus was physical before the day of Pentecost, but the Christ who was preached beginning from Acts 2 became spiritual
The twenty-two Epistles from Romans through Revelation do not teach a physical Jesus; instead, they teach a spiritual Christ
Before we were saved, we were merely physical beings in a physical world, but one day Jesus visited us privately in a spiritual way
Stanza 2 of Hymns 750 says God hath us regenerated In our spirit with His life But He must transform us further In our soul by His own life
When the food that we eat is metabolically digested and assimilated by us, we are transformed in a physical way
We have the divine life of God, but this life has not been worked into our being to make this life a part of our being
The perfected ones coordinate with the transforming Spirit to perfect the lover of Christ by adding God's divine nature into her
The seeker being transformed into a lily signifies that she is now living a life trusting in God, not in her natural strength
She is also looking unto God with a single eye implying that she must also be a dove looking to God by focusing her eyes on one single goal
The perfected ones help the seeker to know God in His nature and to experience Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension
Transformation is the working of the Triune God's attributes into the seeking believers to become their virtues
In the previous message, we saw that transformation in the church life is carried out by the transforming Spirit
The element of gold is wrought into the lover's bound hair, and the plaits of gold are fastened by silver studs
Eventually, what is built at the end of the Bible will be a city of gold, precious stones, and pearls to replace silver
The pearl gates of the New Jerusalem are under the observation of the angels, through whom the law was ordained , as the gatekeepers
The entire Bible speaks the same thing concerning Gods economy to produce the church as the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem
Now we need to see how the Christ-seeker goes on to experience being satisfied with Christ mutually in the churches
At the beginning she was seeking her personal satisfaction, but then she was taught to seek satisfaction mutually with Christ
It has to be personal; then gradually it has to be mutual with the very Christ whom we seek for our satisfaction
Christ as the King is feasting with His lover at the table, and the love of His lover toward Him as spikenard spreads forth its fragrance
Whether or not we can have some spikenard to satisfy Christ depends upon whether or not we have that kind of love toward Him
The word gain is very strongly used by Paul in Philippians 3, where he expresses his aspiration to gain Christ
His Spirit is in our spirit, His Spirit is the reality of His resurrection, and His resurrection always implies His death
We may say that we have exercised our spirit quite often, but when we exercise our spirit, do we receive Christ's death and resurrection?
She enjoys Christ as a cluster of henna flowers, which is Christ in His resurrection for her to express openly
He is with us in our spirit, and with Him is the life-giving Spirit, the refreshing resurrection, and the terminating death
As long as you have Christ, you have the life-giving Spirit, the refreshing resurrection, and the terminating death
In the banqueting house Christ sustains His lover with raisin cakes for nourishment and apples for supply of life
The grape in the New Testament is related to Christ's death because the juice of the grape signifies His shed blood
Christ in His death is signified by the raisin, and Christ in His resurrection is signified by the fresh apples
Christ gains His lover as a companion in love , as the wife , and as a lily, signifying one who lives by His life in trusting in God
He also enjoys His lover as His wife in His embracing and as a lily expressing Him in the filthy and unbelieving world
When we live the lily life, trusting Him and looking unto God with a single eye, the dove's eyes, that is a joy to Christ and His boast
The lover asked the Lord where He pastured His flock for satisfaction and where He made it lie down at noon for rest
Christ and His lover have mutual satisfaction and rest in their mutual enjoyment of all that they are respectively
God's love in Christ is a banner spreading over us, displaying, exhibiting, that we who are loved by God are always more than conquerors
In the church life as the banqueting house, Christ's bread of life nourishes His lover, and His rich supply of life refreshes her
All these kinds of theology in a certain sense help people, but in a greater sense retain them in that theology
Certainly it was the Son's incarnation, but we should never forget that the Son is a part of the Divine Trinity
The Son's incarnation was the incarnation of the Divine Trinity, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Shall have life and live by faith is organic unveiling the purpose of Gods salvation in carrying out Gods economy according to His desire
When some of the sisters give a testimony in the meetings, they are looking for strong 'amens' from the saints
She would never forget this experience and would make it her standard because that became a condition to which she had attained
Such introspection increases the self, resulting in a kind of seclusion as a wall to separate us from the presence of Christ
If we are unwilling to be crucified and we remain in our peculiarity, this 'little fox' will destroy our experience of Christ's resurrection
The more we exercise our own effort to cross out ourselves, the more Satan will come in to stir up our reasonings
In order to receive the crucifixion of Christ, to be put to death, we need the power of the resurrection of Christ
At this time Christ is seen by His lover as a gazelle leaping upon the mountains and as a young hart skipping upon the hills
In order to know the power of Christ's resurrection, we must learn to turn from our mind to our spirit continually
The way to experience Christ in His crucifixion by the power of His resurrection is by the Spirit Himself who is in our spirit
Christ wants His seeker to remain in the cross, that is, to stay in 'the clefts of the rock' and in 'the covert of the precipice'
We may say that some of the things which come to us in our environment to trouble us are Satan's work, but they are also God's assignment
Christ wants to see her countenance and hear her voice in the cross as the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice
To stay in the cross is a hard matter, like getting into the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice by a rugged road
It is only in this way that she can be delivered from her self which frustrates her from experiencing Christ in resurrection
The lover needs gold added to her plaits of hair, silver studs to hold the plaits, and strings of jewels, precious stones
Many Pentecostals stress miraculous healing, but they have no idea that healing is the consummation of Christ's death
Christ's resurrection power is signified by the gazelle's leaping on the mountains and the young hart's skipping on the hills
Simpson hymn on our being crucified with Christ says, ''Tis not hard to die with Christ / When His risen life we know'
Romans 8:29-30 says that we are called, then justified, and then conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God
Satan was crucified , sin was condemned , the old fallen man was crucified , and the world was crucified and judged
Christ crucified all the negative things and then released something positive to supply God's eternally chosen people
The second great thing that was accomplished in Christ's resurrection was that He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit
When she looks away to the resurrected Christ, she enters into the stage of spring, signifying the stage of resurrection
If a brother does not have such an experience of the cross, his speaking in the meeting will be without the content of resurrection
It is by this power of Christ's resurrection that we, the lovers of Christ, determine to take the cross by denying our self
That 'I' is the embodiment of the Triune God, indicating that the entirety of the Triune God is resurrection in the universe
At the end of John 1, Jesus said that the angels of God would ascend and descend upon the Son of Man, indicating that He was that ladder
We need to realize that as the duplication of Christ, we are a heavenly ladder bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven
In order to experience the life-giving Spirit as the reality of resurrection in our spirit, we have to discern our spirit from our soul
We can enjoy experience and gain this wonderful One day by day as the resurrection to empower and encourage us to take the way of the cross
In the church life there is the transformation to transform us, the saved ones, absolutely in the divine life, making us the new creation
Christ calls His successful pursuer to go to the cross that the self might be broken and the natural man might be terminated
Exodus 14 refers to God as the pillar of cloud who brought Israel out of Egypt unto Himself for the fulfillment of His economy
She is a spiritual person standing on the earth as a ladder, bringing heaven to earth and joining earth to heaven
Because he was such a person, like God, he was the only writer of the New Testament to touch the economy of God
In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 he exhorted Timothy to charge certain ones not to teach different things from God's economy
In Ephesians 1:10 he said that in the economy of the fullness of the times, all things would be headed up in Christ
By passing through the adequate process of transformation, the lover of Christ is worthy to be involved in God's economy, to move with God
Song of Songs 3:7 says, 'There is his bed, Solomon's- / Sixty mighty men surround it, / Of the mighty men of Israel'
1) His marvelous victory over all the enemies of God in the church age, signified by a bed in the night with sixty mighty men during the war
The bed in the night , the palanquin in the day , and the marriage life in the ages all refer to the one lover of Christ-the Shulammite
Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be a corporate Shulammite, including all of God's chosen and redeemed people
The death, resurrection, ascension, and Spirit of Christ are not merely objective, having nothing to do with us
Christ is not only in the conditions of His death, resurrection, and ascension, but also in the condition of the life-giving Spirit
Now He calls her again to be with Him in His ascension instead of remaining on the mountain of myrrh and on the hill of frankincense
Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions' dens, / From the leopards' mountains'
For us to experience Christ, we must see that the death, resurrection, ascension, and Spirit of Christ are one group
To know Christ in His death, His resurrection, His ascension, and His bountiful Spirit, we need to see that these four things are one
When we come to the Bible, we exercise our spirit to contact the Lord Himself in His Word by both reading and praying
Before God opened up in the New Testament what was on His heart, both angels and men did not know what God was doing
On the one hand, he made himself the same as the country girl; on the other hand, he made the country girl a queen
Through the divine power in the Spirit of holiness, Jesus' humanity was uplifted into the divine sonship, into divinity
By this He was born of God not as God's only begotten Son but as God's firstborn Son , which indicates that many sons would follow
In heaven Jesus sitting, / Christ the Lord is there enthroned; / As the man by God exalted, / With God's glory He is crowned'
In the romance in Song of Songs, we can see the process through which the seeker passes in order to be transformed
Now as a descendant of Adam she has been transformed to be another person to live in ascension as the new creation of God in resurrection
When the seeker is living in ascension, she and Christ are living in one condition, the condition of ascension, to be a couple
As seeking Christians, in experiencing Christ we must have something private, hidden, shut up, and sealed which is just for Christ
Eventually, this holy garden becomes the green bed for the lover and Christ to live together in mutual rest and enjoyment
In the garden are a fountain and a well of living water, which are streams from the resurrection and ascension life
He is eating His own things, and He invites His beloved friends, the Triune God, to eat and drink deeply with Him
The Bridegroom, Christ, the Son in the Divine Trinity, invites His beloved friends, God the Father and God the Spirit, to enjoy His garden
After reaching the point where she is called to live in ascension, the seeker of Christ has reached her highest attainment
Her becoming a garden is not as high or as deep as her becoming a sanctuary with a safeguard, that is, the holy city, Jerusalem
Song of Songs 6:4 says, 'You are as beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, / As lovely as Jerusalem, / As terrible as an army with banners'
Although Tirzah had a black background when the kingdom was divided the seeker is praised for being as lovely as Tirzah in a positive sense
The sanctuary of God is divided by the veil into two sections: the outer Holy Place and the inner Holy of Holies
Although the sanctuary of God is in the heavens, it is divided into two sections by the veil, which signifies our flesh
With Christ, the veil in the sanctuary of God was split , but with the believers it still remains for the purpose of God's dealing with them
Paul received exceedingly great revelations from the Lord, and he wrote fourteen Epistles in the New Testament
If the apostle Paul could not avoid being proud by receiving so many revelations, who among us can avoid becoming proud?
The self becomes a secluding wall of introspection that secludes the Lord's seeker from the presence of Christ
There is the need for the seeker to remain in the cross by the power of Christ's resurrection to be delivered from the self
Brother Nee's interpretation, no doubt, depends upon his understanding of the intrinsic situation of this romance
The many lovers of Christ eventually will become duplications of God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead
In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus told us that He and the Father would come to the one who loves Him to make this lover God's abode
As we have seen, Song of Songs mentions Tirzah in a positive sense by saying that the seeker is as beautiful as Tirzah
In Song of Songs the lover of Christ eventually becomes a pillar of smoke ; that is a figure showing that she is altogether spiritual
A Christian who lives in the old creation cares for physical things, such as a big house, a nice car, and good clothes
The old man cares for physical things, but we should be those who live in ascension as God's new creation in resurrection
Eventually, when we enter into the Holy of Holies, God's sanctuary, God's dwelling place, there is nothing there but the Triune God
At this point the lover of Christ has reached the stage of living not only in Christ's ascension but also within the veil
At one end is the Holy Place, and at the other end is the Holy of Holies where God Himself dwells in His Divine Trinity
We know this because within the ark in the Holy of Holies there were three items the hidden manna the budding rod and the tablets of the law
As to Christ the veil in the temple has been split in two but as to us God allows the veil to remain in order that we would be one with Him
At this point the lover is described as being as beautiful as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, and as terrible as an army with banners
When she becomes as beautiful as the moon and as clear as the sun, she is also as terrible as an army with banners
A terrible army signifies that these overcomers of the Lord terrify God's enemy, Satan, and become terrible in the eyes of God's people
An army fights the battle for God's kingdom in the degradation of God's people to be the overcomers answering the Lord's call
Jacob decided to go back to his fathers' land when he could no longer stay with his uncle Laban, to whom he had fled from his brother Esau
On the way 'the angels of God met him,' and Jacob said, 'This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim'
When we consider how to arrive at the high peak of the revelation in Song of Songs, we should not trust in ourselves
Right away we will have plaited hair and strings of jewels around our neck, that is, submission and obedience to the Lord
In these four things-life, nature, expression, and function-we become the same as God and Christ, but not in Their Godhead
He is able to make us the same as He is in His life, in His nature, in His expression, and in His function to carry out His economy
In this city we can find all the types, figures, and prophecies in the Old Testament and all the realities in the New Testament
The primary thing is that the almighty King, the almighty 'Solomon,' wants to be one with His people, signified by a country girl
That living must be through the cross in resurrection and in ascension and is heavenly and divine for us to be a new creation
Upon being regenerated there is a call within us to be crossed out, telling us that we should no longer live in our old life
We should not think that we are far away from attaining and obtaining the highest stages of the spiritual life
Our eyes, nose, ears, and all the organs of our physical body were in a gene, even before we were born of our mother
In principle all the spiritual high points are ours already because they are in the gene of God which has been dispensed into us
