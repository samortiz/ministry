<h2 class="head1">THE FAITH THAT SAVES</h2><p>I will not explain this verse now even though I feel it would help you. Let me first tell you what it means to "believe that you have received them, and you will have them." Suppose there is a sinner and you preach the gospel to him. You tell him that he is a sinner and that Jesus Christ has accomplished the work of redemption for him. Then you try to find out whether he has believed. He tells you that he wants to believe, that he wants the Lord to forgive his sins, and that he wants to come to God through Christ. After you hear this, you may feel that your word has produced some result. You may be very delighted and ask him to pray for forgiveness of his sins. He may then pray, "O God, please forgive my sins. I am a sinner and I deserve to die. Thank You that You sent the Lord to die for me and shed His blood for me. Please forgive my sins through the Lord Jesus so that I can be a saved person." How would you feel about this kind of prayer? Is it not a very good prayer? A sinner who can pray like this should be qualified for salvation. This is indeed a model prayer. However, this cannot be farther from the truth. He is really saying that he believes that God will save him and that God will forgive his sins. How terrible this is! By saying that God will do this and God will do that, he is, in effect, pouring cold water all over you. He says, "I fully believe. I believe that God will save me. I believe that He will forgive my sins." Do you think this person is saved? Everyone knows that such a person is not saved, and none of his sins are forgiven. He only believes that he will be saved. He thinks that he fully believes. Actually, he does not have any faith at all. What is faith? It is saying, after one prays, "Thank God, my sins have all been forgiven by the Lord! Thank God, I am already saved!" Perhaps he will say this with tears in his eyes. This is faith. It is not believing that we will have something or we can have something, but that we already have it. It is not believing that our sins can be forgiven or will be forgiven, but believing that our sins are forgiven. This is the only faith spoken of in the Bible.</p><p>What is faith? Faith is not believing that we can have something or will have something. Real faith is believing that we already have it. It is not that we will have it, but that we already have it. How amazing! Many people are clear at the time of their salvation what faith is. They believe that they are already saved, not that they will be saved or forgiven. But when they hear the next step of the truth, they give up the faith that they had before. At the time they are saved, they believe that they have already received. But when it comes to the next step of the truth, they can only believe that they will receive. Friends, we have learned one lesson of faith already. Every saved person has learned one lesson of faith&mdash;they believe that they are already saved. But after they are saved, they have no faith concerning Christ's work in the other areas.</p><h2 class="head1">FREEDOM FROM SIN THROUGH FAITH</h2><p>Let us now turn to the matter of deliverance from sins. Six years ago, a person attended our meetings in Shanghai. He was a board member of an independent church, and he was from a wealthy family. Ninety percent of the pastor's salary came from him. He was an important person in that church. He not only donated a great deal of money, but he was also very zealous. He often attended our Bible study meetings. One morning he came to my home. I had no sooner asked him how he was when I saw tears rolling from his eyes. I asked him what was bothering him, and he said, "Mr. Nee, you do not know me. You think I am a zealous person and that I love the Lord. You do not know what kind of person I really am. Although I am zealous and love the Lord, I have a sickness. I have a terrible temper. It only takes a very small thing to make me so angry that I smash anything that is in my way. Afterward, I realize that this was not proper Christian behavior, and I ask God to forgive me. But after I pray, I still get angry and smash things when my employees do something wrong again. I act the same way toward my family. I am a Christian, but I do not look like one. Although I confess my sins, I still lose my temper after my confession.</p><p>"I tell my employees that they have to `work' on the Lord's Day. What I mean by `working' on the Lord's Day is attending church services. But since I lose my temper at least once or twice a day, they do not believe in the Lord even though I have pleaded with them. When I preach to them, they talk behind my back, saying, `He says he believes in God and that he is a Christian, but he is no better than anyone else. Why should we believe?' When I hear this, I am very saddened. If they perish in the future it will be because of me. I pray to God to forgive me. I have even resolved to not lose my temper anymore. But this has not worked. My temper is getting worse. Last night the whole neighborhood could hear me. A very minor thing provoked me to throw around everything in the shop; even the glasses were broken. My financial loss is not that important. The most difficult thing for me to bear was when my employees said, `How can a Christian behave in such a terrible way?'</p><p>"I know my sin. I cannot sleep all night. I do not want to be like this. Why does it keep coming back? Today is the Lord's Day, and it is my turn to give a message. I told myself that I have to behave today and not lose my temper. If I lose my temper, I will not be able to give my message. But in the morning my wife gave me a bowl of hot soup. She could stand the heat of the soup, but I could not. I was so angry that I threw the bowl at her and had a big argument with her. There is no way I can give a message today.</p><p>"I am a Christian, but my temper is like the devil. I really do not know what to do! This is why I came to you today. Mr. Nee, please think of a way to help me! No matter what it takes, you have to help me to get rid of this temper." He was very sad as he spoke, but as I was listening, I kept on laughing. He said, "Mr. Nee, you have to help me." He was crying as he was speaking. But the more he cried, the more I laughed. He said, "Mr. Nee, I am really miserable!" I said, "You are miserable, but I am very happy." He said, "I really do not know what to do." I said, "Nothing could be better." He said, "Mr. Nee, do not make fun of me." I said, "I am very happy because this is a sickness which only the Lord can heal. Some people can heal themselves, and some people can only be healed by others. The Lord can heal your sickness. He will surely heal you. Although you feel that you have a terrible temper, the Lord is mightier than your temper. A temper such as yours can be healed by the Lord in an instant." He said, "It is not so simple! You have never seen my temper. If you had seen it, you would know that it is not so easy." I said, "It would not matter even if it were ten times worse. The Lord is able to heal it."</p><p>I told him to read Romans 8:2 and then asked him, "What does God's Word say?" He said, "God says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." I asked, "Where does the Spirit free you from the law of sin and of death?" He said, "In Christ." I asked, "Are you in Christ?" He said, "Although I am bad, I must admit that I am still in Christ." I said, "What does the Bible say if you are in Christ? The Bible says that the Spirit has freed you in Christ from sins. What kind of sins is He freeing you from? From your temper. The Spirit has freed you in Christ from sins. Why are you still not freed?" He said, "It is my hope that God will free me today." I then asked, "Does the Bible say that the Spirit will free you? No, God says that the Spirit has freed you in Christ. What does the word "has" mean? None of us say that we have taken our meal tomorrow; we only say that we have already taken our meals. The word "has" means that something is accomplished, that the things mentioned are accomplished facts."</p><p>I went on and said, "The Bible says that the Spirit has freed you in Christ from the law of sin and of death. Are you freed from your sins?" He said, "No, I am not." I said, "If you have not been freed, does that mean God's Word is not true? God says that in Christ you have been freed. Yet you say that you have not been freed. Is God's Word reliable or is your word reliable? Are you saying that God is a liar?" He said that he would never consider God's Word to be lies, and that he believed in all the Scriptures, but that honestly he had not been freed yet. I pointed at him and said, "God is not afraid of your temper. Even if your temper were ten times worse, God would not be afraid of it. But all the sins you have committed in all these years are not as serious as the one you have committed this morning. This morning you have committed the biggest sin&mdash;the sin of unbelief. No other sin is worse than the sin of unbelief. You have an evil heart of unbelief within. You must ask God to remove this evil heart of unbelief so that you can believe." Next I said, "I have to prepare myself because I have to give a message this morning. You should ask God to forgive your sin and to remove your evil heart of unbelief so that you can believe. I am going upstairs and will leave you in the sitting room. You should pray to the Lord here and ask Him to deliver you so that you can believe." Then I went upstairs. After half an hour, I came down and asked how he was doing. He said, "Mr. Nee, everything is fine! I am fully freed, and I am truly freed. Thank God!" Then he went home.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, the faith this person had was a living faith. No one could deal with his temper. But on that morning when he believed, his temper was gone. I did not see him for nearly two months after that. One day I met him on the tram. I asked him how things were going. He said, "Thank God, I am free." After six months, I saw him again and asked him how things were going. He said again, "Thank God, I am free." What is faith? It is not believing that God will work but that God has already worked. It is believing that we already have it. The phrase has already worked implies a fact that has been accomplished. Never change has already worked to will work. All we have to do is to thank God that He has freed all of us in Christ.</p>
