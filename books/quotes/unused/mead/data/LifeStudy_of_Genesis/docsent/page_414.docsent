   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5 God's Sovereignty in Leading Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Meet Rachel and Laban</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God sovereignly led Jacob to meet Rachel and Laban 29:1-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After traveling a very long distance, Jacob came to a certain place, supposing it to be the place where his uncle Laban lived.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible does not say that Jacob was groping for the right place, moving from one place to another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No, it says that he came to just one place and that he immediately discovered that it was the place where Laban lived.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After conversing briefly with some people at the well, Jacob met Rachel, his uncle Laban's daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was sovereign of God that Rachel came and not Leah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know that this was God's sovereign arrangement because in 28:15 God promised Jacob, saying, "Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God was faithful and kept His word, regulating Jacob's steps and bringing him to Laban's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then God brought Rachel to meet Jacob at the well.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 24:13-32, Rebekah and Laban were met by Isaac's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here Rachel and Laban are met by Jacob himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this we see God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all are God's chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you believe that you are a chosen one of God, then you must believe that whatever happens to you is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever happened to us in the past, or is taking place in the present, is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Never be discontented with your circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As one of God's chosen ones, your destiny is in God's hand and your destination is under His direction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your coming into the church life was not an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was brought about by the hand of the God who has chosen you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only are we under God's thumb; we are also in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever you are about to deal with something, you will hold it fast in your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not be afraid of being under God's thumb, for this is a sign that you are in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Simply say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I'm under His thumb and in His hand."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As today's Jacobs, we all are in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>6 Laban's Cheating in Marrying</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His Two Daughters to Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother and that he was Rebekah's son, she ran and told her father 29:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 29:13 and 14, Laban "ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then Laban said to Jacob, "Surely thou art my bone and my flesh" 29:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Laban was a politician.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After Jacob had stayed with him for a month, Laban, thinking that Jacob should be useful to him, said, "Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Tell me, what shall thy wages be?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>29:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Laban was wondering how to catch, keep, and utilize Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one in the book of Genesis is smarter than Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not even Jacob could outsmart him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although Jacob was smart, God was smarter and seemed to say, "Jacob, you are smart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But I'll prepare one who is even smarter than you are."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Laban was not born accidentally; he was born according to God's preparation for the sake of Jacob's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before surgery is performed in an operating room, many instruments are prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In like manner, Laban, who resembled a curved knife, was prepared for Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Laban seemed to be saying to Jacob, "You shouldn't serve me for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Tell me what you want as a wage."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jacob, who loved Rachel, was honest with Laban and said, "I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter" 29:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Love makes people blind and foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I read Jacob's story, I said, "Jacob, you were stupid.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You shouldn't have said that you would work seven years for Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You should have said that you would work seven months."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How could someone as crafty as Jacob have been so foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because he loved Rachel and wanted to secure her at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, Jacob also was quite clever, realizing that if he had proposed a short term of employment, Laban would not have agreed to the deal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, because he was afraid of losing Rachel, Jacob offered to work for Laban for seven years that he might have her as his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not a small thing to work for such a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If I had been Jacob, I firstly would have offered to work for seven months and then I would have bargained with Laban about the length of time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Laban was greedy, robbing his nephew for seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible does not say that after the seven years were expired, Laban called Jacob and told him that it was time to marry Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No, it was Jacob who said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her" 29:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Jacob seemed to be saying, "Laban, my seven years have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Where is my wife?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have worked for you, and now you must give me my wage."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Laban was very smart.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After gathering together all the men of that place and making a feast, he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob, "and he went in unto her" 29:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The feast was during the day, but the marriage was at night.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That night Laban beguiled Jacob, giving him his elder daughter Leah in place of Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When Jacob discovered the next morning that Laban had cheated him, he said, "What is this thou hast done unto me?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Did not I serve with thee for Rachel?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>29:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Jacob did not care for Leah, whose eyes were dull; he loved Rachel who was "beautiful of form and beautiful of appearance" 29:17, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After Jacob had complained to him, Laban said, "It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Fulfill her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years" 29:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Laban was truly a crooked knife.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Nevertheless, Jacob agreed to this arrangement, having been beguiled by Laban to work a total of fourteen years for Rachel, the wife of his preference.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God's sovereign hand was in this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Jacob loved Rachel, but God sovereignly kept her away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>While Jacob did not labor one day for Leah, she was given to him as a free gift, as an addition.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In this we see that God will let you have your preference, but you must pay the price for it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Your preference will always cost you a great deal, for besides giving it to you, God will give you an addition.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God seemed to be saying, "Jacob, do you love Rachel?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I will give her to you, but you must pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>After you pay this high price, I shall give you an addition.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This addition is according to My will."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Rachel was Jacob's wife according to his choice and preference, but Leah was his wife according to God's concept and will.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Proof of this is found in 49:31, where we are told that Jacob buried Leah in the cave of Machpelah, the wonderful cave in which Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, and Rebekah were buried.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Notice that Leah, not Rachel, was buried there.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God is consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In His eyes there is one wife for one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God did not recognize Rachel as Jacob's wife, because she was Jacob's preference.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Leah was Jacob's real wife.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In addition to giving Jacob his preference, God taught him many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In like manner, you, a worker for the Lord, may prefer to have a certain brother as your co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But that co-worker is selected by you according to your preference, not by God according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Our God is great.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you want your preference, God may say, "I shall let you have your preference.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But this is a good opportunity for Me to give you some dealings and transformation and to teach you some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Eventually I shall give you as your real co-worker the one whom I have selected and whom you do not like."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>God gave Leah to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Did Jacob love her?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Probably not.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In 29:31 we are told that "Leah was hated."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Firstly, she was hated by Rachel and then she was hated by Jacob who undoubtedly was influenced by Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Some have taught that God never allows us to have our choice.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This teaching is inaccurate.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>God will permit you to have your choice, but along with it, you will have a certain amount of dealing and transformation.</S>
