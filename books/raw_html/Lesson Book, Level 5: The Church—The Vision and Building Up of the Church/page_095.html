<h2 class=head2>B. Being One With All the Saints</h2><p>In order to build up a proper local church, we need to be one with all the saints in the church. We should never criticize or backbite. Neither should we have a particular love for some and not for others (Phil 2:2). Since we need to build one another up, we must be one with one another without any division. “There should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another’’ (1 Cor. 12:25).<h2 class=head2>C. Submitting to the Authority of the Elders</h2><p>Submitting to the authority of the elders is essential to keep the oneness for the building up of the Body. The elders are the more mature brothers in each locality appointed by the apostles to shepherd and perfect the church. Not being one with the elders and not submitting to their authority leads to spiritual suicide. A local church not in fellowship with the apostles cannot go on. Likewise, saints that do not submit to the authority of the elders cannot be built up. Our God is not a God of confusion. He has established the proper order in the Body. Elders do not have authority of themselves, but they are the deputy authority of the Lord to care for the churches. The saints should not fear the elders but should fellowship with them continually and be open to receive their fellowship, realizing that the elders have been appointed by the Lord to shepherd the church. By submitting to the authority of the elders, all the saints will be shepherded into life and be perfected to build up the church.<h2 class=head1>CONCLUSION</h2><p>Psalm 133 is a psalm on building up the church. The key is the oneness among the brothers. Because of the oneness, the anointing oil and the watering dew flow from the Head to the Body. There is also the commanded blessing of life for evermore. Division kills. Oneness brings in life and building. We all must live in our spirit to keep the oneness of the Spirit to build up the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Why must God’s expression be in oneness?</li><li>How do we practice the oneness with the church universally?</li><li>How do we practice the oneness with the local church where we meet?</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Practical and Organic Building Up of the Church (Lee/LSM), pp. 16-22.</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Further References</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Practical and Organic Building Up of the Church (Lee/LSM), pp. 15-24.</li></ol>
