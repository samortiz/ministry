   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE ONE THE BACKGROUND AND SUBJECT OF THE BOOK Scripture Reading: Phil 1:1-18, 27-30; 2:1-5, 12-16; 3:2-11; 4:2-3, 14-19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible there are two books which are concerned with experience rather than with doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These books are Song of Songs and Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apparently these books have no relation to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if we get into the depths of these books, we shall find that they are sister books and that both are concerned with the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, it would be helpful to study the Song of Songs along with the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have pointed out that four New Testament books make up the heart of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These books are Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Galatians, Ephesians, and Colossians all have a similar pattern of composition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In these books Paul first presents doctrines, then experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After setting forth a certain doctrine, Paul encourages us to walk according to that doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ephesians, for example, is written in two main parts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first part, chapters one through three, sets forth the doctrine regarding the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the second section, composed of chapters four through six, is concerned with our walk according to the doctrine unfolded in the first three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since Ephesians is composed in this way, it is a book of both doctrine and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In principle, the same is true of Galatians and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The book of Philippians, however, is different in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not Paul s intention in writing this book to convey doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This does not mean that there is no doctrinal element in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the New Testament writings have a doctrinal ingredient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But strictly speaking, Philippians is not concerned with doctrine; it is concerned with the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1:20 Paul says, Christ shall be magnified in my body, and in 1:21 he declares, To me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two statements represent the basic concept of the whole book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this book we are charged to magnify Christ and to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To magnify Christ is not only to express Him; it is to express Christ by causing Him to be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should magnify Christ by living Him in a practical way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our daily living should be a living that lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Certain ethical teachings encourage people to live by particular virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The book of Philippians, however, does not charge us to live according to ethics or virtues; it charges us to live according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ must be everything in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He must be even such virtues as humility and kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before Paul was saved, his life was centered around the law, and he lived the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But after he was converted to Christ and was regenerated, he began to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ became not only Paul s life, but also his living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, according to his experience, Paul could declare that to him to live was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I. THE BACKGROUND</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this message we shall consider the background and subject of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every book in the Bible has both a background and a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the book of Philippians is concerned with the experience of Christ, some may think that there is no need to consider the background.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, even this book on the experience of Christ was written with a certain kind of background.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This background is the reason the book was written.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to get into the depths of the significance of this book, we must know its background.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The book of Philippians does not say explicitly what the background is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But as we consider Paul s statements and exhortations in this book, we detect certain hints regarding the background.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we read the four chapters of this book carefully, we shall find four elements related to the background.</S>
