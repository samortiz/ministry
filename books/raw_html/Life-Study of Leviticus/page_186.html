<h2 class=head3>3. The Feast of the Firstfruits</h2><p>The third annual feast is the feast of the firstfruits (vv. 9-14). This feast signifies the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 15:20) for our enjoyment as a feast in His resurrection.<p>This feast took place less than three days after the Passover feast. Christ was crucified at the time of the Passover feast, and then on the third day He was resurrected. The day of His resurrection was the feast of the firstfruits. This is Christ in His resurrection as the firstfruits.<h2 class=head4>a. The Sheaf (Not One Single Stalk of Wheat) of the Firstfruits of the Harvest Being Brought to God</h2><p>“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you enter into the land which I give to you and reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest” (v. 10). This signifies that the resurrected Christ, with some of the Old Testament saints (cf. Matt. 27:52-53), was brought to God. When Christ was resurrected, some of the Old Testament saints were resurrected with Him. “Coming out of the tombs after His rising, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many” (Matt. 27:53). With Christ, these resurrected saints became not a “stalk” but a “sheaf that was brought to God, just as in the type the firstfruits were brought into the sanctuary and presented to God for His fresh enjoyment.<h2 class=head4>b. The Sheaf of the Offering to Be Waved before Jehovah on the Day after the Sabbath (the Eighth Day) That God’s People Might Be Accepted</h2><p>“And he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah that you may be accepted; on the day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it” (Lev. 23:11). This signifies that Christ was resurrected that we might be justified before God and accepted by God (Rom. 4:25b).<h2 class=head4>c. On the Day of the Wave Offering a Male Lamb a Year Old, without Blemish, to Be Offered as a Burnt Offering to Jehovah</h2><p>“On the day that you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to Jehovah” (v. 12). This signifies that the resurrected Christ, being fresh, tender, meek, strong, and without blemish, is offered to God as a burnt offering that is absolutely for God.<p>This life that is absolutely for God implies not only Christ Himself but also all of us who were resurrected with Him. When Christ was resurrected, we all were resurrected in Him and with Him (Eph. 2:6). This means that we were resurrected before we were born, a fact that is clearly revealed in 1 Peter 1:3. We all were offered to God with Christ as a burnt offering on the day of His resurrection. Now in Christ and with Christ as a burnt offering for God, we may live a life that is absolutely for God.
