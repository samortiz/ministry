   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STUDYING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE OLD MAN AND BY THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to have this realization when we come to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may study the Bible either by the old man or by the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians study the Word in a natural way, according to their old man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you read the Word of God, do you read it by the old man or by the new man?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we merely exercise our mind to get knowledge from the Word, we are reading it by the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To read the Bible by the new man is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even before coming to the Bible, a person in the new man exercises his spirit to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He may confess, saying, "Lord, I am sorry that I live so much in my old man, not exercising my spirit to contact You, to live by my new man, as one of Your new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, forgive this sin."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we approach the Bible in this way, exercising our spirit, we have the deep feeling and sense that we are approaching, touching, and contacting God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By this I do not mean that the Bible is God but that in coming to the Bible we are coming to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>PRAY-READING THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we come to the Bible to contact God, we should not only read but pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No matter who we are, as long as we read the Bible without praying, we are reading by the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To read the Bible without praying is to contact the Word by the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The genuine reading of the Bible by the new man can never be separated from praying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Reading the Bible Prayerfully</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The term pray-reading has been in use for less than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This does not mean, however, that before we invented this term, there was no such thing as pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many saints have practiced the pray-reading of the Word without using this expression to describe what they were doing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A number of seeking Christians have pointed out that the best way to read the Bible is to read it prayerfully.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have read certain books which said that we should read the Bible in a prayerful way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To read the Word prayerfully actually is to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can testify that long before we began to speak of pray-reading, it was my practice to read the Word with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, I remember reading John 3:16 and praying, "O God, thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You loved the world so much.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>O God my Father, You loved me so much that You gave Your Son, the Only Begotten, to me."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I had the feeling that I had touched God and that He had touched me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through my prayer John 3:16 became Spirit and life to me.</S>
