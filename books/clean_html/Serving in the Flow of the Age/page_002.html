<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING TO ONE ANOTHER<br />
AND TEACHING AND ADMONISHING ONE ANOTHER<br />
WITH PSALMS, HYMNS, AND SPIRITUAL SONGS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:18-19 says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; In these verses being filled in spirit and speaking, singing, and psalming are mentioned. According to the grammatical structure in Greek, these are not two separate things but two aspects of one thing. It is difficult to say whether being filled comes first or whether speaking, singing, and psalming come first. It seems that either one can be the cause or the effect of the other. On the one hand, when we are filled in spirit, we spontaneously praise God with overflowing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; psalms are long poems, hymns are shorter poems, and spiritual songs are poems that are even shorter. On the other hand, speaking to one another and singing and psalming cause us to be filled in spirit.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo; The word of Christ here is a word that is living, fresh, and present; it is not doctrines. Ephesians 5:18-19 mentions speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs first and then singing and psalming. Colossians 3:16 mentions teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs first and then singing to God. In our religious concept, we think that psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are for singing only; however, Ephesians and Colossians show that psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are also for speaking to one another and for teaching and admonishing one another. Hence, we can speak to one another, teach one another, admonish one another, and then sing and psalm to the Lord. If we speak to one another until we are inspired, we will spontaneously psalm to God; this is different from our traditional, religious concept. We must see that psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are useful not only for singing but also for speaking, teaching, and admonishing.</p>
<p>Since it is a concept in Christianity that psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are related only to singing and that singing is related to music, people have studied music in depth. Almost every chapel has a choir leader, but the choir is focused only on the melody and rhythm of the songs, not on the inspiration of the spirit. We are just the opposite. We focus on the spiritual utterance, teaching, and admonition in the words, not on just the music itself. It is not easy to speak, teach, and admonish with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, because we often focus on spiritual things only with our mind as if we were studying mathematics. Therefore, we must call attention to the matter of speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs so that we can turn to be in the Holy of Holies in order to touch the throne of grace. Unsuitable speaking cannot turn a person from wandering in his mind, but speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs will bring us into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that entering into the Holy of Holies is a matter of turning to our spirit (Heb. 4:16; Eph. 2:22; Rom. 8:10). The Holy of Holies is in the third heaven (Heb. 9:12, 24); however, today the Lord dwells not only in the third heaven but also in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Our spirit is the Holy of Holies that reaches the heavens. The Lord&rsquo;s throne, which is a throne of grace, is in the Holy of Holies, and a river of water of life proceeds out of this throne to supply us with grace (Heb. 4:16). If we only sit and listen to messages, we will be in our mind most of the time; however, if we speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, we will turn from our mind to our spirit as we speak. Whether we are literate or illiterate, we can all enter into the Holy of Holies and touch the throne of grace. </p>
<p>When we studied Ephesians in a training in Taipei in 1953, I did not see the matter of speaking to one another in chapter 5. In 1968 in Jakarta, Indonesia, however, the phrase <em>speaking to one another</em> shined out to me. I immediately fellowshipped with the brothers about practicing the speaking of hymns to one another. Everyone enjoyed the Lord very much in that meeting. After I went back to Taiwan, I fellowshipped this matter with the churches, but there was not much response; everyone still gave messages according to routine.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee emphasized repeatedly in his Kuling training that if a person gives a message from his mind, it can only touch people&rsquo;s mind; only that which is of the spirit can touch people&rsquo;s spirit. Brother Nee spent a long time to fellowship with us about paying attention to our spirit and releasing our spirit. This is needed in order to touch people and to touch their spirit. Although the co-workers have been paying more attention to releasing their spirit when speaking, much of the time they are still in their mind and do not release their spirit fully. We often speak messages according to our mind; this shows that we are under the influence of the traditions of Christianity. Instead, we should encourage people to speak to one another in spirit. Speaking hymns to one another is the easiest way to release the spirit. If we become experienced in speaking to one another, every hymn will be able to touch us.</p>
<p>Thus, we should not select hymns based on our old experiences but on the present &ldquo;season.&rdquo; This is like choosing some clothes for winter and different clothes for summer. Similarly, our speaking in the church must match the audience as well as the season. Some words are suitable for a father to speak but not for a mother; other words are suitable for a mother to speak but not for a sibling. We should not lead the church only according to our experiences. On the one hand, we cannot lead without experience, but on the other hand, we cannot lead merely according to our experience. Even when we teach, we cannot rely on experience alone. Lastly, we should not be disappointed because we cannot do everything well. Everything is in God&rsquo;s hands; He is able to deliver us from the influence of Christianity.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the help that we receive from others is a benefit to us, but on the other hand, if the help is not rendered properly, it can ruin and even destroy a good piece of material. Although Christianity has passed the Bible and the gospel of the Lord Jesus to us, it has also given us many traditions that have damaged our experience of the Lord. I was born in Christianity and grew up in Christianity; I received the most help from Christianity, yet at the same time I was deeply damaged by Christianity. To this day I must admit that it is hard to be rid of its influence completely.</p>
