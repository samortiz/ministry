<h2 class="head2">Tsinan, Shantung Province</h2><p>I received thirty copies of Issue No. 7 of The Open Door. This number is adequate for the brothers and sisters. There are about four or five brothers and sisters who are clear about their salvation. In the near future we hope to have a baptism meeting. We also hope that the Lord would send His workers to come and help us. We heard that Brother Chao Bi-chen has a burden to come. May the Lord release him to come. We can only put this matter into our prayers. May the Lord grant him the grace and give him the guidance. I hope that the brothers and sisters will pray much for the meetings and the saints here.</p><p>Your brothers representing the church in Tsinan,<br />Ren Yi-cheng, Chen Shi-chen, Yu Tsia-chi, June 30<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Du, Shantung Province</h2><p>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>The news in The Open Door brought me up-to-date concerning the whereabouts of the brothers and sisters. I was very comforted. The faithfulness of the brothers and sisters before the Lord renewed my strength. I see God's blessings and the needs in these places through this publication. As I read, I could not help but call on the Lord! Oh, may the blessings and power of God be with the footsteps of the brothers and sisters, and may their footsteps be according to the Lord's leading.</p><p>God has been gracious to us in Yi-Du. We are able to worship Him and remember the Lord at His table. We began having the Lord's table last fall. Now there are about thirty in the meeting. God has done this for His own glory; we have not done any running or striving. We are weaker than others and prone to making mistakes. We need more of the Lord's grace and dealing than those who are in other places. Please remember us weak members in your prayers. Brother Chang Tze-jieh visited us in April and preached for three days. There were over two hundred people in the audience. Thank the Lord that those who were thirsty were satisfied. That day is now closer to us than before. Whenever we consider the expansion of God's work, we feel joyful as well as fearful. We rejoice that many are saved and that God has gained the glory. We fear because we are afraid that our work will not pass through the fire. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Lee An-rong<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Wu-Yang, Honan Province</h2><p>This is the first time we have communicated by letter. Since I received The Open Door, my spirit has felt as if we are a group of children gathering around our Father. Recently, some brothers and sisters left because of the political tension. Two missionaries also left for Gi-Kung Mountain. Those who were left could only pray with one accord. Presently, the church functions as normal. The shops are open, and there are many customers. This is a golden opportunity for preaching the gospel. Please pray much for this.</p><p>Shi Nai-en, July 6, in the Gospel Hall</p><h2 class="head2">Hankow, Hupeh Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>On the nineteenth of this month, there were bombings in the three cities around Wuhan, and the casualties rose to over a thousand. It was too gruesome to hear of the condition of the bombed areas and of the dead and the wounded, much less to see. Four bombs were dropped at the place where Brother Hwei-tze was. Fortunately, no one was hurt, and no house was flattened. All the brothers and sisters in Wuhan are well. Please be at peace.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi, July 20</p>
