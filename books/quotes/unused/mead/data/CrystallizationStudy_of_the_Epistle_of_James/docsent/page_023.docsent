   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PURPOSE OF GOD IN HAVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JAMES AS A BOOK OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see that God inspired James to write the Epistle of James with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This purpose is to expose James's mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>James's own writing exposes his fault.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a later message we will see more concerning the purpose of God in having James as a book of His holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The purpose of God is just to expose James; however, throughout the centuries most of the readers of the Bible approve James.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The whole Scripture was written under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, but not every word in the Bible is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word itself may not be the word of God, but it was recorded by some writer under the inspiration of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All Scripture is God-breathed 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word in the Scripture and the scriptural record itself are two distinct things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, the word in Genesis 3:1 is the word of Satan, but the record of that word is through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moses wrote that word under the inspiration of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>PAUL'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now let us read Galatians 5:1-4 to see what Paul's attitude was concerning the law:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Behold, I Paul say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul shows us that the yoke of slavery is the bondage of the law, which makes the lawkeepers slaves under a binding yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To deviate from Christ to the law is to be entangled or held in a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to stand fast in the freedom from the slavery of the law, not deviating from Christ, not falling from grace.</S>
