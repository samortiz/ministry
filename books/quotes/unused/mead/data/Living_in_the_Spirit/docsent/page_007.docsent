   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Isaiah 9:6 there are two lines one line is the line of the child, and the other is the line of the son.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A child was born to us, and His name was called Mighty God, and a son was given to us, and His name was called Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today, however, those in Christianity believe the first line but not the second line.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we were to ask them whether the child born in the manger was the mighty God, they would strongly answer that He was.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If, however, we asked them whether the son given to us was the eternal Father, they would not dare to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even many pastors would not dare to answer because many of them are under the influence of traditional teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, when I visited America I strongly asked, "Should we believe only half of Isaiah 9:6, or should we believe the whole verse?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we believe that the child is the mighty God, we should also believe that the son is the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If anyone condemns us of being heretical because we say that the Son is the Father, we should show them Isaiah 9:6 and read it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I was in the United States, I taught the brothers and sisters there a very simple strategy of how to deal with these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, we should ask them whether they believe that the Bible is true.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If they do, we should ask them whether they believe that the book of Isaiah is true.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If they do, then we should ask them whether they believe that Isaiah 9:6 is true.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If they say that they do, then we should ask them whether they believe that the child is the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If they still say yes, we should ask them whether they also believe that the son is the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way we will stop all their arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not argue with such people, because the more we argue, the more they will become confused, and the more they will argue with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not need to say anything except to ask them these few questions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then they will be unable to do anything except acknowledge that the Son is the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are many deep things pertaining to God that are beyond our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, every Christian must accept the plain words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the first step.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second step is to show them 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, "The Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should ask them whether the Lord in this verse refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will surely say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one would say that the Lord in this verse is not the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord mentioned here is the Lord Jesus cf.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we should ask them who the Spirit in this verse refers to.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They would have to admit that the Spirit mentioned here is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There would then be no need for further argument.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We could also show them 1 Corinthians 15:45b, which says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is also irrefutable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The critics will surely ask many other questions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They may ask, "If you say that the Son is the Father, then how could the Son pray to the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And how could the Father hear the Son's prayer?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can tell them that we do not know how to answer, and neither do we want to.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we can ask them to explain John 14, where the Lord says to Philip, "Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father; I am in the Father and the Father is in Me" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not try to explain, because eventually we will become confused and will be unable to fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, Isaiah 9:6 is very clear, as is 2 Corinthians 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One verse says that the Son would be called the Father, and the other verse says that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In one of his hymns, Brother Nee said, "Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called, / But now the Holy Spirit art" Hymns, #490, stanza 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This shows that Brother Nee saw this matter a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am not here to argue about doctrines but to give you an impression.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all need to see that our God is one and that this one God, as the mysterious One, is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is the Father for a reason, He is the Son with an intention, and He is the Spirit for a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reason, intention, and purpose are that He would fully work Himself into us.</S>
