   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Peter Seeking Fellowship under Authority</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Peter went to Caesarea by himself, he did not go individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He had fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Peter went from Joppa to Caesarea, he took the brothers from Joppa with him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was always under authority and always seeking fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, as soon as he returned to Jerusalem, he told the brothers what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the job had been done, he still sought fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Philip Being Met by the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Philip went to Samaria, he was one who submitted himself under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Otherwise, the Holy Spirit would not have called him to the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All those whom the Holy Spirit has met are those who are still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything in the church is arranged and regulated by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Head of the church is Christ, but the operation of the Head is through His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Holy Spirit brought Philip to the wilderness, he was still under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not a Matter of the Number of People</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Individualism is not a matter of one person or two; it is not a question of more people or less people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Individualism is a matter of whether one is under authority and whether one has the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today some brothers may go out with several others, but these brothers can still be completely individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you go down from the mountain to work, you may say that you are standing in the position of the Body to learn to serve, yet if five of you are still five persons, and ten of you are still ten persons, you have failed completely before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is not fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fellowship is not a matter of how many people are in the room, the number of people who sit beside you, or whether anyone accompanies you as you go out.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible emphasizes two persons going out together so that there may be fellowship concerning things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But this does not mean that when there are more people, there is fellowship, and when there are fewer people, there is no fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, God's children should know these two basic lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, they need to know authority and submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second, they should treasure the fellowship of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They should seek the fellowship of life and the supply of life from others so that they can go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only when these two lessons are present can we be free from individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When these two lessons are absent, immediately individualism becomes present.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Basic Principle of</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Having Two or More Persons</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Bible the principle of workers going out to work is that of at least two by two.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, when Paul went out to work, there were at least two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There might have been an exception to this principle in Philip's going to Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a man is under authority and lives in fellowship, even if he has one exception, he still does not damage the basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This does not mean that having many people going out is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are not in oneness, even if there are ten brothers going out to work together, it is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, when you go to Wen-Shu or Tsingtao, it is not a matter of electing someone to be a group leader.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not something done by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, spontaneously you realize that there is a person in front of you, and that you need to listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Spontaneously, you learn submission and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people will become as one man, as one body going out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this there is no individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Otherwise, if you have one person, it is called one-person individualism; if you have ten persons, it is called ten-person individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more persons there are, the more individualisms there are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, you will be proposing a work based upon multiple individualisms.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the past you might have believed in personal individualism; today you believe in plural individualisms.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If this is the case, this is not the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to know what the Body of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Body of Christ is one in life and submits under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This authority can be manifested among any group of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Each one needs to learn to stand in his place; then there will not be any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In such a condition one should not humble himself deliberately, nor should he be so concerned for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, he should learn to accept man's instruction and opinion and learn to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As everyone stands in his own place, all will see that this way is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps all the problems are due to individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the whole problem and the greatest problem.</S>
