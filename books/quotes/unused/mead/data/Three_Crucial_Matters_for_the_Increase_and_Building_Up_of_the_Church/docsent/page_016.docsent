   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE EVERYONE FUNCTIONING TO SPEAK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE LORD OVERTHROWING THE ORDINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By changing the system, we are overthrowing the ordinances of Christianity, in which a few people replace the function of the other members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A few members cause the other members to be unemployed and thus kill their function.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Traditional Christianity does not believe that all the members can function.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In traditional Christianity only the clergy, the pastors and preachers, can function.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, we must rise up to eliminate the system of Christianity in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This system has the element of leaven that the Lord Jesus spoke of in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Matthew 13 a woman hid leaven in three measures of meal v. 33 . The three measures of meal signify Christ as food to supply God s people, and the woman signifies the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>History shows that not long after the church was produced, the Catholic Church brought in many different heresies, leaven, and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Bakers add leaven to flour to make bread easy to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Leavened bread is soft and easy to chew, but unleavened bread is hard and difficult to chew.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to this principle, the Catholic Church brought in many heresies in an attempt to make the truth easy for people to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We came out of Christianity, but our Christian background is still with us, and it influences us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christianity is influencing people all over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people who do not believe in Jesus think that they understand Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning minor items, they think that Christianity involves steepled buildings with bells that ring at specific times on the Lord s Day and crosses on top of the steeples.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a common concept concerning Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With respect to the major items, unbelievers know that Christianity has pastors and that Christians go to worship services and listen to sermons preached by the pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most people think that Christianity, as represented by the Catholic Church, is mainly composed of pew members, who do not need to do anything but attend mass.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are also priests, bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the pope dies, another pope is chosen from among the cardinals to be his successor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BEING DELIVERED</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FROM THE POISON OF CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thirty years ago, when I was in the Philippines, one of the brothers had a relative who was in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This brother took several other brothers to visit his relative.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the hospital they surrounded the bed of the relative and prayed one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Philippines is a Catholic country, and everyone has some knowledge of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to their understanding, whoever is able to pray must be a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Someone in the ward asked the brothers whether they were pastors, because they prayed better than most pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our brother answered that they were not pastors and that we do not have pastors in our church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This response surprised the people who were present.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christianity gives people the impression that praying and preaching are the job of pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This impression, this poison, is still among us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are only a little better than Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though we changed the system, most of the brothers and sisters still do not pray or function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They do not avoid praying, but they do not pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Previously our practice was to have everyone listen to a message lasting an hour and a half, after which one person would pray out loud, and then everyone else would pray silently.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we discovered that this was not a good practice, because most people did not know what to do during the time of silent prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we changed our practice to allow half an hour after the message for everyone to testify concerning the light, revelation, and help they received.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was an attempt to break the habit of only one person speaking and everyone else listening.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This change gave everyone an opportunity to function and was helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The practice of giving testimonies after the message is being carried out successfully in America.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Between 1969 and 1974 the testimonies after the messages were living, and sometimes thirty minutes was not enough time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Taiwan, however, the testimonies are almost all dead, and the same brothers and sisters always stand up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shows that there are traces of the poison of Christianity among us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In addition, those who speak tend to give long testimonies; they can even speak for fifteen minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is also evidence of the poison of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the physical realm, as soon as a newborn is spanked, it begins to cry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A mother would be concerned if her child did not cry after being spanked.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A child who cannot speak by the time he is eight to ten years old is dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today, are the new believers among us and those who have been saved for twenty years speaking Christians, or are we dumb Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We speak all day without stopping, but as soon as we step into a meeting, we become dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We speak unceasingly outside the meetings, but we become dumb as soon as we are in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is a suffering to be in a family where some family members cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the church life the greatest suffering is when no one speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is the meaning of our existence if there is no church on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not speak in the meetings, where else can we speak?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our only enjoyment on the earth is to serve the Lord and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, when we encounter someone in the church meetings who does not speak, we suffer.</S>
