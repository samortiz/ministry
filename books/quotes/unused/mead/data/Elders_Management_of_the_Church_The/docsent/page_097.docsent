   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>COORDINATION IN SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The oversight and administration of the elders are nothing other than the gospel, the perfecting, and the service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Following the gospel, there is the perfecting, and following the perfecting, there is the service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As to the service, it must be done in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The one thing that requires the most spiritual consideration in service is the matter of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The oversight and administration of the elders must be carried out in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If they cannot be carried out in coordination, the elders' administration will surely be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to realize that if the Lord is to gain the goal in the church in this age, the saints must be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This building up is the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The gospel brings in the saved sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a person is saved, he needs to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After being perfected, he needs to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, he must not serve individually, but serve in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the coordination in service.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ASPECTS OF COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people have taken our use of the word coordination to mean the organization of institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, the two things are very different.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word "organization" is not found in the Bible, but the word "coordination" is found in the Chinese Version of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Chinese translation of 1 Corinthians 12:24 is, "God coordinated the body together."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From this verse we derived the word "coordination."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Body is coordinated together by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You can say that the Body is an organization, because it is organized together by the different parts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But God says that this Body is a matter of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 12:5 says: "So we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Being members one of another to become one Body is a matter of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now let us consider the various aspects of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. Having Life</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders have to consider seriously everyone who wants to come into the coordination to see if each one has life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In common terms, we should find out if such a one is saved or not.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here, however, we are not emphasizing the matter of salvation, but the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today, Christianity has spoiled the term salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It seems that salvation has come to mean only the forgiveness of sins, the deliverance from perdition, and a passage to heaven after you die.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the elders' administration of the church is toward the goal of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason the elders cannot pay attention simply to an incomplete salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, they should pay attention to whether or not a person has life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the goal is merely salvation, there would be no need of administration, oversight, or coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since everyone will go to heaven anyway, why does the church still need oversight?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why is there still the need for coordination?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, in order to administrate the church, you must take life as the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first consideration is that you must have life.</S>
