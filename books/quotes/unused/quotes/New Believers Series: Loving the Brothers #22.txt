Before the Gospel of John there are three Gospels the Gospels of Matthew Mark and Luke which cover many acts and teachings of the Lord Jesus
The Gospel of John shows us the highest and most spiritual things concerning the coming of the Son of God to earth
When we come to the final Epistles, the Epistles written by John, we find the emphasis shifting to other things
While the other Epistles pay much attention to a man's faith in God, John emphasizes one aspect of practical conduct before God
Suppose you have many friends and you like them very much, or you admire many people and respect them very much
There is still a difference between your feelings toward them and your feelings toward the brothers and sisters in your own family
If a person is born of your mother, if he is your brother, there is spontaneously a special and inexplicable feeling toward him
Suppose there is a person whose appearance, family background, education, disposition, and interest are totally different from yours
Through faith we pass out of death into life, and through faith we are made members of the household of God and are regenerated
Once we have this life, we will have a feeling for the many people throughout the world who also have this life
In the absence of this discernment, the more perfectly the gospel is preached, the greater will be the danger of counterfeits
The Epistles of John show us clearly that the way to differentiate true faith from false faith is not through faith itself but through love
Whether or not a person is a genuine Christian depends on whether he has a special taste for and attraction toward other children of God
John 4:7-8 says, 'Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God
Everyone who is begotten of God has love in him, and everyone who has love in him spontaneously loves the brothers
If a person knows that you are a brother and yet he hates you in his heart, it proves that he is not a Christian
If a person knows that you are a brother and are of the Lord yet still hates you, it proves that he has no life in him
In other words, the Bible denies the possibility that anyone can hate his brothers; it does not accept this as a possibility at all
Verse 15 says, 'Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him'
If there is a brother who has committed a sin worthy of excommunication, we may deal with the matter with indignation
If there is a brother who has done something extremely evil, we may ask him to come to us and rebuke him severely before the Lord
Under normal circumstances, if a brother has done things which irritate you, you can exhort him and rebuke him, but you cannot hate him
Even if you 'tell it to the church,' according to Matthew 18, your intention should still be to gain him and restore him
The purpose of telling it 'to the church' in Matthew 18 is for restoration; the removing in 1 Corinthians 5 is also for restoration
If a person can only judge and condemn but has no tears or sadness it proves that he does not know anything about brotherly love
If anyone rebukes a brother only for the purpose of tearing him down, such a one has no love in him, only hatred
Darby's first words were, 'I think it is the most dreadful thing for a sinner whose sins have been forgiven to excommunicate another sinner'
It is a willingness to deny oneself for the perfection of others, and a heart that will even lay down one's very own life for his brothers
John 4:10-12 says, 'Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins
God commands us to leave the denominations and not remain in any sects; however, many of God's children promote the denominations
We must leave the denominations if we want to love God, and we should stay in the denominations if we want to love our brothers
It is right for us to obey and follow God's commandments, but we must not offend our parents in our attitude and our words
We must show our brother that we are not doing something for ourselves; we are doing it because God has said so
Verses 17 and 18 say, 'In this has love been perfected with us, that we have boldness in the day of the judgment
