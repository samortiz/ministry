   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY GOD'S WAY OF ACCOMPLISHING HIS PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN 1 Date: December 13, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: The Savior's Church, Foochow</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Gen 2:7-9, 16-17; Rom 8:29-30; Heb 2:9-11 GOD'S ORIGINAL PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beginning from tonight we will study God's purpose in man in a systematic way and show how He accomplishes such a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's Word shows us that His purpose is to have many sons, that is, a group of men who will have the life of His Son Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Genesis we see God creating the heavens and the earth, and then creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After this He put the man He created in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's purpose in preparing the garden of Eden and putting man in it was not that man would merely be a gardener, but that he would eat the tree of life and receive His life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Human beings work according to a purpose and a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God, being much wiser than man, works even more according to a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God did all these things according to a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His plan is that man would have His life and become His many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God wants many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet Adam did not have such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Adam's goal might have merely been to become a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But even if he had become perfect, he would still have fallen short of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A perfect man cannot fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In reality Adam did not become a perfect man; he became a sinner instead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today man has two problems.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, he is a sinner, and second, he is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a sinner, he needs salvation, and as a man, he also needs salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person needs to be saved because he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person also needs to be saved because he is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The forgiveness of sins merely recovers man to Adam's original position in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a "man," he still needs to receive God's life before he can become a son of God and before God's purpose can be accomplished in him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to accomplish His purpose in man, God has to do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, He has to save the sinner and deliver him from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, He has to save the "man" himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since man fell through sin, he became a sinner estranged from God on the one hand, and a man who had fallen short of God's purpose on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are sinners, and as sinners we need forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are also men, and as men we need God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only when we have both of these things can God's purpose be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man's problem is not one of being good or bad, sinful or sinless, perfect or imperfect.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man's problem lies in what he is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as he is simply a man, he needs God's work, and he needs God to dispense His life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only then will he be able to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's forgiveness of man's sin is an incidental work it is not His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man's sin is something negative, something incidental.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order for God to achieve His purpose in man, He first had to solve the problem of sin, but His ultimate goal is to dispense His life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>GOD'S PURPOSE BEING FRUSTRATED</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We know that Adam ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result he became independent, knowing good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There was no more need for man to ask God or to trust in Him; he became independent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Adam became an independent sinner estranged from God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is a sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A sinner is simply one who is separated from God and independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Being separated from God and independent of God is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence anything that originates from man is sin, and any act that is done independent of God is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A man does not have to commit fornication, robbery, murder, or arson.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As long as he is separated from God, he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Originally Adam was innocent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was not able to differentiate good from evil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He had to ask God for everything and find out from God whether something was good or bad, right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he was able to know good and evil by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There was no more need for him to seek after God or to trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He became independent from God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through the knowledge he acquired, he became a man who was independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way, God's purpose could not be fulfilled and His will was frustrated.</S>
