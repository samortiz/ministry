[1]  As people who have been born of God and have Christ living within them, all Christians must be brought by the Lord's mercy to the point where they are no longer wholly caught up in studying about Christ, doing something for Christ, or even serving Christ, but rather are in the reality of touching and experiencing Him in a living way day by day.
[2]  All this is indeed wonderful, the wonder of wonders, that Christ became a man, accomplished redemption for us, became the Spirit, and has now entered into us to be our life and everything to us; but the question we must now raise is this: How can we touch and experience Christ in a practical way as our very life moment by moment?
[3]  All we have to do is call upon Him, and we will touch Him who is the life-giving supply.
[4]  Again we have to praise and thank the Lord that He has not only told us that we must call upon Him, worshipping Him in spirit and in truthfulness, but He has also given us a very practical and simple way to touch Him in this true worship.
[5]  When we cry Amen from deep within, we sense that we have touched Christ just as when we called, "O Lord, O Lord," because as His name is Lord, so also is His name Amen.
