   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOBER UNTO PRAYERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 4:7-11 Peter goes on to speak about ministering as good stewards of the varied grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 7 says, But the end of all things has drawn near; therefore, be soberminded and be sober unto prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All things on which the flesh rests will pass away, and the end of them, the apostle tells us here, has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This warns us that a life lived in the flesh in the lusts of men v. 2 will soon be ended, for it is related to all things which will shortly pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we should be soberminded and be sober unto prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Literally, to be soberminded is to be of a sound mind; it is to have a mind of sobriety, able to understand things properly and thoroughly without being disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, to be sober unto prayers is to be sober to watch; hence, vigilant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is to be on guard; hence, sober unto prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This equals the Lord s word, Watch and pray Matt 26:41; Luke 21:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to realize that all things will come to an end. Peter says that the end of all things has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, instead of loving material things, we should be soberminded and be sober unto prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not set your mind on a better home, a better car, or a better education.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The end of all such things has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>LOVE AND HOSPITALITY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 8 continues, Before all things having fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Love must be first.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 9 Peter says, Be hospitable to one another without murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Peter wrote this verse according to his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He knew that hospitality can be troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the saints love the Lord, the church, and the ministry, they are willing to extend hospitality to those visiting from other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the saints who show hospitality may be hospitable with murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some may complain about how a saint who once stayed with them conducted himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that our hospitality will be without murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>GOOD STEWARDS OF THE VARIED GRACE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 10 continues, Each one according as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The varied grace of God, as the all grace in 5:10, is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects 2 Cor 13:14; 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As good stewards, by the gift we have received we should minister to the church and the saints such grace, not merely doctrine or any vain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fact that verse 10 is the direct continuation of verse 9 indicates that even showing hospitality is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Showing hospitality to others gives us an excellent opportunity to minister to them the varied grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need grace to prepare food for your guests, to provide transportation for them, and to help them with special needs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It takes patience to wait for them if they are late.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By this we see that in our hospitality we need to minister the varied grace of God to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, in verse 10 Peter does not mean that we minister grace only in hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He means that we minister grace according to whatever gift we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 11 Peter says, If anyone speaks as oracles of God; if anyone ministers as out of the strength which God supplies; that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might unto the ages of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The oracles here are the divine speakings or utterances as revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the ministry of grace, as mentioned in verse 10, our speaking should be God s speaking, God s utterance, that conveys divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 11 Peter mentions the strength which God supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God supplies to us the serving strength of Christ s resurrection life through the Spirit of Christ Phil 1:19; 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>GOD GLORIFIED THROUGH CHRIST IN ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The goal of speaking as oracles of God and ministering in the strength that God supplies is that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This indicates that all our ministry of grace, whether in speaking or in serving, should be full of Christ, so that God may be glorified through Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter concludes verse 11 with the words, To whom is the glory and the might unto the ages of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The relative pronoun whom refers to God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The glory and the might belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Glory is without, and might is within.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Might supplies the strength within us; glory is God glorified upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, glory corresponds to glorified, and might to strength.</S>
