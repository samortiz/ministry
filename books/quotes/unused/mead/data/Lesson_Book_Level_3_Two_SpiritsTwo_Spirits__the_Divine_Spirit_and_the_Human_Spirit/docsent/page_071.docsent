   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Apostle Paul said in Romans 1:9, "For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then he said in Romans 7:6, "But now we are discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, that we should serve as slaves in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter."</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. LIFE AND SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this lesson we are dealing with the practical aspect of the Christian life, that is, the service.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With us as Christians there are always two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first aspect is a matter of the Christian life, a life matter, and the second aspect is a matter of the Christian service, a service matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the Lord's children, on the one hand we need a proper life, a spiritual life, and on the other hand we need a proper service, a spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Matthew 25 the Lord Jesus gave two parables, the parable of the ten virgins, which deals with the Christian life, and the parable of the talents, which is related to our service.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As far as our life is concerned, we should be as the virgins with the testimony of light in our hand as we go out of this world to meet our Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is our life, the life aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need the oil, and we need the testimony of light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to go out of this world, to wait for the Lord's coming back, and to go on to meet His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Immediately following this parable, the Lord gave us the parable of the talents, which is something related to our service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to use the talent, the gift, which the Lord has given us, to do some business and to make some profit for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With the Lord's children there are always these two aspects, the life and the service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to grow in life with the oil, with the light, and with the going out of this world to meet the Lord in His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also need to exercise in a proper way what the Lord has given us as a gift, as a talent.</S>
