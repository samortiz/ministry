   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Late Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Rest of the Seed of the Universal Woman</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we want to see the late overcomers the rest of the seed of the universal woman Rev 12:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the rapture of the man-child to the throne of God and after the reaping of the firstfruits for the Father's satisfaction, a period of time on this earth begins called the great tribulation, the darkest and the worst period of time in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the environment in which the late overcomers are the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After there has been the rapture of the man-child to the throne and the dragon, Satan, has been cast down to the earth, Revelation 12:17 says that he becomes angry with the woman and goes to make war with the rest of her seed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The devil knows his time is short and he is the more enraged v. 12 . The rest of the woman's seed signifies the people of God that were not in the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The people of God that are not in the man-child are the weaker part of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At this point in time, the devil is not making war with the man-child or with the firstfruits because they have been raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is making war with the weaker part among God's people, so this is a terrible point in time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also, in Revelation 14 after the reaping of the firstfruits, you have a solemn warning that goes out to the whole inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>An angel says with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God..and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a serious warning to all people on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Right after this, there is a promised blessing to anyone who will be martyred during this period of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 13 says, "And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will be a period of time where people will die in the Lord and receive a big blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are the late overcomers, the ones who have passed through the entire tribulation but have maintained the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows that in a very dark time the Lord always has a way to maintain the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 15:2 says, "And I saw as it were a glassy sea mingled with fire and those who come away victorious from the beast."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are the overcomers who come away from the great tribulation in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They come away out of the tribulation victorious, and they do this at the cost of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because they stand for the Lord and for His testimony, they will be martyred by Antichrist, the beast.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Revelation 13 Antichrist is likened to a leopard with feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion v. 2 . This shows us that he has all the characteristics of the evil beasts, the evil powers, that have preceded him in human government.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the worst of all the beasts, having all their characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, Antichrist is the consummation, the totality, of all the evil powers throughout all of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We enjoy the consummated God, but Antichrist is another consummation, the consummation of all the evil powers in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Revelation 13:2 says that Satan, the dragon, gives his power, his throne, and great authority to Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Antichrist is slain in the middle of the last seven weeks, the last seven years of this age, and he is resuscitated with the spirit of Caesar Nero that comes out of the abyss v. 3 and Revelation 17:11, note 111, Recovery Version . This is the beast that will be persecuting the weaker part of the people of God during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can see that this will be the darkest time, yet still the Lord gains a testimony through the weaker part of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During the great tribulation they can no longer lean on those in the man-child or the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So they rise up to be the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are seen standing on the glassy sea, which refers to the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The warning to those on the earth who worshipped Antichrist and his image was that they would be judged by the lake of fire, but these late overcomers are standing on it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have nothing to do with the lake of fire, because they have overcome Antichrist, his image, and the number of his name 666 in the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a glory that in every age, no matter how dark it is, the Lord always gets His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We want to be the testimony of Jesus in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not here to be late overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We want to overcome the easy things in this age that seem so hard to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It will be terrible to be on the earth during the great tribulation, but there will still be the testimony of Jesus.</S>
