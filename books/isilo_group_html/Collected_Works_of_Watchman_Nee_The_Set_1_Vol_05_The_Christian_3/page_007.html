From Leviticus 2 we can find the help to explain this parable. The fine flour in the meal offering is the three measures of meal referred to here. It should not contain any leaven (v. 11). Hence, the crucial point here is that the woman has done something that God has forbidden. She ought not to have done this! In this way we see that this parable is the same in spirit as the first three parables. Sin has become more serious and more hidden here than in the first three parables. The meal offering typifies Christ as the bread of life and as food for the priests of God. To put leaven in the meal is to change the nature of Christ. What the woman is doing is a symbol of what renowned churches are now doing.</P><P>This is an important point, and we must spend more time to consider this. In the Old Testament there was a feast, the Feast of the Unleavened Bread. At this feast the Jews were to eat unleavened bread for seven days. In the first day all leaven had to be removed from their houses. From the first day to the seventh, anyone who ate of leavened bread would be removed from the Israelites. Even while our Lord was on earth, the Jews were still keeping this feast according to the letter. When the Lord Jesus mentioned this parable, the Jewish disciples could very easily understand the meaning of this leaven because the practice and work of removing leaven was so common and widespread among them already. Judging from the act of removing the leaven at the feast, the leaven must refer to something negative. The Jews who were listening to the Lord's parable knew definitely that no leaven could be used in the meal offering. Moreover, God clearly forbade that any offering offered to Him by fire contain leaven. It was not hard for the audience of that day to understand the meaning of leaven.</P><P>If we read through all the passages in the Bible that refer to leaven, we can see that in no place is leaven referred to as something positive. The passage that we are considering now is no exception. If we put this parable together with the preceding three parables, we can see that leaven here is not positive. Moreover, when we consider the Lord's own definition of leaven, we have no choice but to consider leaven as negative. Leaven refers to the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Matt. 16:12).</P><P>Christ is our spiritual food, dispensed to us through teachings or doctrines. The Bible often considers the Word as food. We can receive it by faith to meet our need. Christ is the truth. We enjoy Christ through the truth. The teaching of the Pharisees pays attention to outward forms and self justifications. The teaching of the Sadducees is the teaching of the modernists of today. Both teachings oppose the Christ revealed by God and understood by faith. In Mark 8:15, we see in addition to these two things the leaven of Herod. This is the teaching of fame and fortune. According to the Lord's own word, leaven means lust, the devil, and the world. These combine to corrupt the truth of Christ.</P><P>After understanding the style of this parable, we are reminded that Paul has similar words. The Lord Jesus says, "A woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened." Paul said: "A little leaven leavens the whole lump" (1 Cor. 5:6). After reading these two examples, we have to conclude that these two portions are parallel to and complement one another. However, in 1 Corinthians 5, unlike Matthew 13 where the meaning is hidden, the apostle pointed out the meaning of the leaven. Since these two portions are parallel passages, we can find out the meaning of leaven from 1 Corinthians. In verse eight, the apostle explained to us the meaning of leaven. It means "malice and evil." The meaning of being unleavened is "sincerity and truth." In this way, we can draw a conclusion for our study of the meaning of leaven.</P><P>Why does it say three measures of meal? In the Bible, meal refers to nothing other than Christ. If we read the Old Testament, we will see that three measures of meal is a unit of food. It seems that three measures of meal is the basic unit of food. When Abraham offered hospitality to the heavenly guests, he made unleavened bread out of three measures of meal. If we identify Christ there and in this parable, we will readily understand the meaning of this parable. In His status as the Son of Man, the Lord Jesus gives to us food which abides unto eternal life (John 6:27). Because He is man, He can be the food that we need. However, what is the number of "the man Christ Jesus" (1 Tim. 2:5)? Three is the number of God; it signifies the Triune God and the sufficiency of God. "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily" (Col. 2:9). Any number smaller than three will not match the truth revealed here.</P><P>The woman here put leaven into the three measures of meal, but who is this woman? No doubt she is the church. In the Bible, a woman is always a type of the church, whether physical or spiritual, but of the two, which one does the woman here typify, the real church or the nominal church? After reading this parable, we will readily find out what church is symbolized by this woman. The previous parable is in the nature of Babylon because the small seed there grows into a big tree, just like Nebuchadnezzar did. This tree is a symbol of the church's reigning in the world. Once it has an inclination to reign, it unavoidably comes under the influence of emperors and kings. It becomes natural for them to adjust ordinances and change doctrines on the church's behalf. At such times, the leaven is put into the three measures of meal.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 05: The Christian (3) &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
