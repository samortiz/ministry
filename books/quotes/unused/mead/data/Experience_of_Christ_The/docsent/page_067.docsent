   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 2:10 says, "To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What does it mean to say that Paul forgave in the person of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I spent a long time studying this verse before I came to realize Paul's meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My understanding of this is best expressed through an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once I was invited to a brother's home for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At a certain point I asked the brother a question, and then I turned the question to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before she answered me, she first looked at her husband, and he looked at her.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Learning from the look in her husband's eyes what to say, she proceeded to answer me in the person of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many husbands and wives relate to one another in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a wife does not know how to behave in the person of her husband, she is independent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A wife should always speak in the person of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Any wife who speaks according to the person of her husband is a very good wife, for she lives not by herself, but by her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although she has her own personality, she does not live by her personality, but by the person of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the young people need to learn how to live in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The way to experience Christ is to live in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to do everything in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, if you can watch television in the person of Christ, go ahead and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if you honestly cannot watch it in the person of Christ, you should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you look at the Lord as you are watching television, He may tell you to shut if off.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, a married brother must learn to speak to his wife in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he lives in the person of Christ with his wife, he will not argue with her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he checks with the Lord as he is about to exchange words with her, the Lord will tell him to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What a wonderful life we would have if we lived in the person of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul was one who lived in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to 2 Corinthians 2:10, he forgave in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul did not do anything according to his choice, taste, or preference.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, he did everything according to the taste of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The best wife is one who lives by taking her husband as her person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The husbands also need to live in the person of their wives, but with discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is according to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to God's household arrangement, the headship is not with the wife, but with the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, both the wife and the husband need to live in the person of the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then their married life will be sweet and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What a wonderful experience it is to live in the person of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the Greek text, the Greek word rendered "person" in 2 Corinthians 2:10 is the same word as the word translated "face" in 2 Corinthians 4:6, the verse which says that the glory of God is in the face of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that when Paul lived in the person of Christ, he lived in the face of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was a man in Christ, who was found in Christ in a condition based upon faith and conditioned by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to know Christ in his daily experience, Paul did everything in the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ and he were not two, but one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, in Philippians 1:21 he could say, "For to me to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He lived in the person of Christ and was one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Two persons, Paul and Christ, lived as one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need such a life as this.</S>
