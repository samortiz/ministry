   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ as Life Being Small to Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The descriptive word in the third parable is mustard v. 31 . These are parables, figurative records that we must understand in a figurative way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must learn to read the figures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Seed grows into wheat, and wheat is good for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is grown in Matthew 13, then, is good for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the third parable we still have a seed, a mustard seed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A mustard seed is very small but good to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The mustard seed is Christ, who is small to us in order to be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have a hymn that says, "So subjective is my Christ to me!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>/ Real in me, and rich and sweet!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hymns, #537 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Originally, we sang the second line as, "Small in me, and rich and sweet!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, some said that if we sing it in this way, simple people will not be able to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To think this way is the mentality of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In a good sense, are we bigger, or is Christ bigger?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some people may eat turkey for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is the turkey bigger, or are we bigger?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I say to you, we are bigger than anything we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anything we eat must be smaller than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If it is bigger, we can never swallow it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, it may swallow us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If it is bigger than we are, we have to cut it into smaller pieces in order for it to be food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is so small to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times I worship Him, saying, "Lord, I worship You for Your smallness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because You are so small, I can feed on You."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is fine and small, like the mustard seed that is good to grow into something for people to feed on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mustard is not a building material; we cannot build a house with mustard, because it can bear no weight.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is good only for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Matthew 13 the enemy changed the little mustard seed in its form and image to become a great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is against the principle of God's creation in Genesis 1, which says that living things should be "according to their kind" Gen 1:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A mustard plant must be after the kind of mustard, but the mustard in Matthew 13 is not according to its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It changed in nature and in form, which breaks the principle set up for God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The mustard seed changed into a tree, which is good not for eating but as lodging for the birds, which signify Satan's evil spirits with the evil persons and things motivated by them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today's Christianity is mostly good for lodging.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you travel throughout the whole world to find mustard good for eating, you will see that there is almost none.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you go to almost any kind of so-called church, you will get no food.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You will only find a place good for lodging in the evil sense.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the frustrating and damaging work of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Meal for Bread to Satisfy God and Man</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Still, the Lord is victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some wheat has produced grain, and the grain has been made into fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the Scriptures, wheat is for making bread to offer to God as food to satisfy God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From the seed comes the wheat, from the wheat comes the grain, and from the grain comes the fine flour to make bread to satisfy God and to satisfy man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, in the fourth parable in Matthew 13 the characteristic word is meal v. 33 . Even at this point, however, the enemy is not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He still comes in to frustrate by bringing in the leaven to corrupt the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have the seed sown, the wheat grown up, and the fine flour produced to make bread to satisfy God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is God's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, there are still the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This should not be a mere message; we have to check ourselves according to this message.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consider Christ as the seed of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is it snatched away?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Are we the stony ground?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is something within us always choking the seed?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Have we been frustrated by false Christians, either by our friendship with them or by following them in certain worldly ways?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Are we growing now?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is the fine flour, the meal, produced in us, or is there the leaven?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All these four parables reveal life and growth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without life we cannot have the meal to make the bread to offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even if we have life, without the growth we still cannot have the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need life, and we need growth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Precious Stones and the Pearl for God's Building</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the fifth and sixth parables in Matthew 13 we have a treasure and a pearl vv.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>44-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The treasure hidden in the field must be gold or precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Both the precious stones and the pearl are transformed items.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After the growth in life there is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we read the Bible carefully, we can see that both precious stones and pearls are good for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The New Jerusalem is built with precious stones and pearls Rev 21:19-21 .</S>
