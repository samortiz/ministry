   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By Pouring Out His Life unto Death</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaiah 53:12b says that Christ poured out His life unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Hebrew word for life literally means "soul."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, the Lord poured out His soul unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This corresponds with the Lord's word in John 10:17-18: "I lay down My life that I may take it again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This commandment I received from My Father."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Lord's death He laid down His life, and in His resurrection He received it back.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ poured out His human life to be an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every offering, if it is a sacrifice, must be killed, and the blood must be poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No sacrifice that is still living can be an offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every sacrifice must be killed, and the blood must be shed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then it can be an offering accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His death Christ poured out His life in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus far, we can see that in Christ's crucifixion, man did something, God did something, and Christ Himself did something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ's crucifixion could not have been accomplished without the participation of any one of the three parties.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man did the murdering, the killing, but God carried out the legal judgment to kill Him as a legal Substitute that He might die a vicarious death for the ones for whom He died as a Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, He Himself was willing to be such an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He made Himself that offering, and He poured out His life for that purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. To Accomplish God's Eternal Redemption,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>that the Believers in Christ May Be Redeemed</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>unto the Life Union in His Resurrection,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>the Reality of Which Is the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ's crucifixion was for the accomplishing of God's eternal redemption Heb 9:12 , that the believers in Christ may be redeemed forgiven of sins Acts 10:43, justified Acts 13:39, and reconciled to God Rom 5:10 unto the life union in His resurrection, the reality of which is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:9b; Phil 1:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ's redemption includes forgiveness of sins, justification, and reconciliation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As sinners, we all needed forgiveness and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were not only sinners but also enemies of God; thus, we also needed reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ's redemption did all this for us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ's redemption accomplished the forgiveness of sins and justification for us, the sinners, and it also accomplished reconciliation for us, the enemies of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These three things added together constitute Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Redemption is unto a life union in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 5:18 says that justification is "of life."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that justification is for life, or unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are justified that we may have life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This life is a life union in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Christ's resurrection, which followed His crucifixion, we have life, and this life is a union.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We enter into this union by being redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through Christ's redemption, we are justified unto this life union in His resurrection, the reality of which is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ's death was not merely a murder, nor was it a martyrdom; it was a redemption carried out by the Substitute for God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was Christ who bore our sin in total before God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through such a death we were redeemed, forgiven of our sins, justified, and even reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a redemption brings us into a life union in Christ's resurrection, and the reality of that resurrection is Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all need to spend some time to know Christ in His four stages.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since we believe in Him as our Savior, have received Him as our Redeemer, and trust in Him as our life, we should know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank the Lord that there is a chapter, Isaiah 53, that tells us all these things concerning Christ, and thank Him that He has opened this chapter to us in such a way.</S>
