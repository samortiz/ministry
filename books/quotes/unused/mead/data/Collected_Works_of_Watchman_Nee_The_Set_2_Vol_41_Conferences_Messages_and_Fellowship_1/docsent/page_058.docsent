   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REJOICING ALWAYS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A few passages in the Bible speak of rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 5:11-12 says, "Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you." "Rejoice and exult" means "to greatly and jubilantly rejoice." James 1:2 says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, whenever you fall into various trials." What is our tone in the midst of trials? James said that we have to count them all joy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is real victory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A fish has to be in the water before it can survive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the same way, the overcoming life can only survive in an environment of thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If it is placed in an atmosphere of sorrow, it will die.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever our heart is stripped of thanksgiving and praises, it loses its victory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Philippians 4:4 says that we have to rejoice always.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rejoicing in the New Testament is unceasing rather than occasional.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There should never be a time out for our rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever we lose our joy, we lose our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, we must rejoice in the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Peter 4:13 says that believers should rejoice under all kinds of circumstances and be filled with thanksgivings and praises.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many believers do not have a smile on their faces.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is an expression of joylessness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On one occasion Paul and Silas were beaten and chained together by their hands and feet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet they were still able to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As they sang, their mouths might have faced downward, but their hearts were surely faced upward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This thanksgiving and praise shook the earth and rattled open the prison gate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their spirits had gone out, yet their bodies were still there Acts 16:22-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the victory that the Lord is after.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He wants to hear our song in the middle of the night because He knows that the sunrise is only hours away.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>GIVING THANKS IN EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In what should we give thanks?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Colossians 3:17 and 1 Thessalonians 5:18 say that we should give thanks in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should have a habit of giving thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that whatever may happen great things, small things, good things, or bad things we have to give thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One brother was a railway worker.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once while he was working, a train came by and through an oversight one of his legs was cut off by the train.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he woke up at the hospital, he was asked how he felt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He answered, "Thank and praise the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When he was asked, "How can you thank and praise the Lord at a time like this?", he answered, "I do not consider how many legs I have lost.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I consider how many legs I have left."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The tone of victory is one in which we thank and praise in the midst of trials.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our hearts should yield to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should accept whatever He gives us joyfully, and we should rest in His will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not enough for us to merely endure the trials.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The kind of endurance described in the Bible is not a passive endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Colossians 1:11 says that we are empowered unto all endurance with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The kind of endurance that is sustained through the gritting of teeth is of little use to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>An overcoming endurance is one which endures with joy, and only those who fully embrace God's will can endure and suffer with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THANKSGIVING AND PRAISE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE WAY TO VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thanksgiving and praise are the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are also the way to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Second Chronicles 20:21-22 tells of the Israelites overcoming their enemies in battle through praises.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jehoshaphat the king of Judah appointed the Levites to give praise in holy array v. 21, ASV and to go before the army, giving thanks to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They were in holy array; they were not in armor or carrying any weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Others might have marveled at them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, they had to fight, and on the other hand, the victory was not theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They fought from the basis of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First they won, and then they fought this is true victory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Fighting and then winning is not victory, but defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We first believe that we have overcome and then go forth to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We do not fight in order to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is a big difference between these two.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible says that we fight because we have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we see this, we will know how to apply this fact in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Suppose temptations come our way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we see that the Lord is our victory and that He has overcome already, and if we go forth into battle on the basis of this, we are shouting for victory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if we fight in order to win, we are defeated already.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>True victory is knowing that we have overcome and then going to battle on the basis of that knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Such a battle of victory overcomes the enemy through thanksgiving and praises.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once we give thanks and praises, the enemy flees away.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we believe in God's Word, we can break forth into praises.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Psalm 106:12 says that after God drowned the whole army of Pharaoh in the Red Sea, the Israelites believed in His words and sang His praise.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whenever we have the faith, we can overcome and sing God's praise.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have to learn to thank and praise Him unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not bury our thanksgiving and praises.</S>
