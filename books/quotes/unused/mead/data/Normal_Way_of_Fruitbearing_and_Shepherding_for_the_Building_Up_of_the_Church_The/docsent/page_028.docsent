   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED TO SHEPHERD OTHERS IN OUR DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will speak concerning our need to shepherd people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To speak about this is difficult, because this matter touches each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To play politics with people is easy, but to touch people in an honest, frank way is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1956, when a servant of the Lord visited us in Taiwan, he recommended to us the political way to touch people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He illustrated this way by saying that we should never speak the truth about little babes to their mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a baby is beautiful, we can say, What a beautiful girl is this!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the baby is not good looking, however, we should say, Oh, what a girl this is!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I heard this, I could not agree with this kind of political speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I felt that it was a kind of British diplomacy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Lord s recovery we cannot play politics in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I were here to play politics, there would be no need for the present training.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Shepherding Being</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>the Most Demanding Need in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sisters who are mothers know that nothing is as demanding as being a mother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who have never had children do not know the real meaning of demanding.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nothing and no one in the universe is as demanding as children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If an adult catches a cold, he may not ask for anything, but if a little one has a cold, he must be cared for.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A mother can never ask for sick leave.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even if she is about to die, she must first take care of her child s need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the same for fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A proper father must take care of his children s demand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A child s demand is without mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have seen many young sisters who could not be adjusted by their father, mother, or even husband, but once they had children, they learned many lessons from these little ones 1 Tim 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before they have children, some sisters do not practice to rise early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It seems that everything in their world is just right for sleeping late.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After they have children, however, the little ones wake them up very early.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes when I saw this, I wanted to commend the little children and say, Very good!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What no one else could accomplish for many years, you have done in only a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nothing is as demanding as shepherding, not even gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Just as in child raising, everything related to shepherding is not up to us; it is up to the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot say that we have no time or that it is not convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is for those under our care to decide.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every Member in the Church Having</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>the Normal Ability to Shepherd People</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way of Christianity is to hire a pastor to shepherd a church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not what we mean by shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may argue that shepherding is a gift that not every brother or sister has.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, no one would say that raising children is a gift that some have and others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every parent, regardless of how smart or foolish he is, has a talent for raising children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Child raising is not a special talent; it is a talent given by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same way, by our spiritual birth every member in the church has the gift of shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To say that we do not have the gift of shepherding is to annul our spiritual birth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some think that because they are too young and are not pastors, elders, or experienced Christians, they cannot shepherd others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a wrong understanding and concept.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should forget the wrong teachings we received about shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Someone may not know how to raise children, but when the children come, they are forced to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The parents of a young mother may think that she cannot raise her children, but the more they let her do her job, the more she will learn how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to drop the wrong concept and pick up the proper one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even someone who has been saved for only a few days can learn to shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to be the proper, normal members of the church in the Lord s recovery, we need to build up a daily life of the gospel, and we need to go to the Lord for Him to show us who should be under the care of our shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If these two matters are built up in the church, we will have a normal, proper church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A normal church is not merely one in which the members stand to speak something in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is only a small part of our service.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The main part of the service in the church is a daily gospel life and shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our concept must be regulated and radically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should realize that it is a great lack and a shame not to bear fruit each year and have someone under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the members in the churches should bear fruit and shepherd people all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we build up these items, the church will be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord s way is always the best and wisest way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His way is to depend not on spiritual giants but on every member, on those who have a daily gospel life with shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all need a change of concept in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>More than thirty years ago, I came together every Monday morning with a group of serving ones from 8:00 A.M. until the afternoon to mutually learn how to shepherd people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After meeting for three years in this way, there was a great revival in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This was not due to a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It came out spontaneously because of the building up among us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The gospel preaching and the shepherding were adequate and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is what the churches need today.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord has raised up His recovery in many cities, but we are still short of a daily gospel living and of shepherding.</S>
