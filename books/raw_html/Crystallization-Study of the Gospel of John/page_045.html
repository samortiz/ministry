<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Christ Being Resurrection All the Time</H2><P>Christ, as the embodiment of God, is the resurrection all the time, even before He was resurrected. Whether Lazarus died or lived, Christ is always the resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Exercise of Himself as Resurrection</H2><P>Not only was the resurrecting of Lazarus His exercise as the resurrection, but also all the miracles done by Him were the exercise of Himself as the resurrection. When He healed the blind man, that was His exercise of Himself as resurrection. A living person in resurrection has the light of life to see.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Overcoming Death and All the Things Belonging to Death</H2><P>Resurrection is mainly to overcome death and all the things belonging to death. Blindness, dumbness, deafness, and all kinds of sickness belong to death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Everything Christ Does in His Believers<br>Being the Exercise of Himself as Resurrection</H2><P>Before Martha came to Him, Christ was the resurrection when He did the many miracles of healing. Today with His believers everything He accomplishes is the exercise of Himself as the resurrection. Regenerating, sanctifying, renewing, transforming, conforming, and even glorifying are the exercise of Christ as the resurrection who is life eternal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Q. The One Grain of Wheat</H2><P>Christ is the one grain of wheat (John 12:24) for death resulting in resurrection. This refers to Himself as the divine seed to produce many grains (the people who receive Him) to become His many members who constitute His organic Body which consummates in the New Jerusalem. If one grain of wheat remains whole, it is only one grain. But when it falls into the earth and dies, it will grow and bring forth many grains in resurrection. These many grains are to be ground and blended into flour to make a loaf, which signifies the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). Although we are the many grains, we do not like to be ground in order to be blended. But we need to be broken. Then we can be blended with others. We should not remain as whole grains. We have to be broken and ground into fine flour so that we can be blended with others for making a loaf. This loaf is the Body of Christ which consummates in the New Jerusalem.</P>
