   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>J. Pharez and Zarah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From Tamar we go on to her son, Pharez v. 3 . Tamar conceived twins Gen 38:27-30 . At the time of delivery, one boy, Zarah, tried to come out first, but he did not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He put out his hand, and the midwife marked it with a scarlet thread, indicating that he would be the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, Pharez preceded him to be the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, the first became the last, and the last became the first.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The midwife was surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a good illustration of how to gain the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Pharez inherited the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man did not choose him, but God sent him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This proves that it is not up to man s endeavoring; it is up to God s choice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The mother s story tells us one side: that we should be anxious for the birthright, trying our best to obtain it; the son s story tells us the other side: that although we may strive to obtain the birthright, it is actually a matter of God s choice, not our efforts see Rom 9:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I remember a story concerning D. L. Moody.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day a student at his Bible institute said to him, Mr. Moody, by reading the New Testament I have learned that all the saved ones are the chosen ones, predestinated by God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now I have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I preach the gospel and convince people to believe, I may do something wrong and persuade someone whom God has not chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moody replied, My son, just go ahead to do your best.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As people enter the door, they will see written on the outside, Whosoever will may come.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But once they have entered the door, they will look back and see written on the inside, Chosen before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Tamar s story means, Whosoever will may come.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Tamar willed and Tamar came.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But her son s story means, Chosen before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps you are today s Tamar, striving and laboring to obtain the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But once you gain it, you will look back and see that you were chosen before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The birthright does not depend on us; it depends on His choice.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>K. Rahab</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We proceed to Rahab v. 5 . Rahab was a harlot in Jericho Josh 2:1 , a place cursed by God for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although she was a harlot in such a place, she became a grandmother of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How could a harlot become a grandmother of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to answer this question, we need to find the principles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The entire population of Jericho was destroyed except Rahab, her family, and her possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She was saved because she turned to God and God s people Josh 6:22-23, 25; Heb 11:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After she turned to God and His people, she married Salmon, a leader in the army of the leading tribe of Judah and one of the men sent by Joshua to spy out Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time, Salmon became acquainted with Rahab and, in a sense, saved her.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, Rahab married him, and they brought forth a godly man named Boaz.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we must pay our full attention to the principles governing our association with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first principle is that, no matter what our background is, we must turn to God and to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second, we must marry the proper person, not in a physical sense, but in a spiritual sense.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After we have turned to God and to God s people, we must be joined, built up, and involved with the proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Third, we must bring forth the proper fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we will be fully in the portion of the birthright of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It seems that many Christians today have lost their birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They do not have Salmon and Boaz.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you would have a Salmon and a Boaz, you must become involved with the proper believers, with the proper leading ones in the leading tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then you need to bring forth the proper fruit, Boaz, who will be a forefather of David.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must turn to the Lord, and we must turn to the Lord s people; we must also take care of how we become involved with others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we become involved with the proper persons, surely we shall bring forth the proper fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will keep us in the full enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>L. Boaz</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are to know the story of Boaz, we must read the book of Ruth It is a good story.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Boaz is a type of Christ, and Ruth is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The book of Ruth tells us that Boaz redeemed Ruth; he also redeemed the birthright for her.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that Christ, as our real Boaz, has redeemed both us and the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Boaz redeemed his kinsman s inheritance and married the man s widow Ruth 4:1-17 ; hence, he became a notable forefather of Christ, a great associate of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a brother and a Boaz, you should take care of others birthright of Christ, not only your own birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In other words, you should not only take care of your own enjoyment of Christ, but also others enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ruth was the daughter-in-law of Naomi.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As we read this story, we see that Ruth and Naomi had lost the enjoyment, the birthright, but according to God s regulation there was a way to restore the birthright, to redeem it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But it had to be redeemed by someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The principle is the same in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If I lose the birthright, the brothers have a way to redeem it for me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Quite often, some dear ones lose their enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In a sense, they become Naomi or Ruth If so, you need to be a Boaz, able to redeem the lost birthright and marry the redeemed one.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Suppose I am a real Ruth who has lost her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To lose the husband means to lose the enjoyment of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have the birthright, but I have lost the enjoyment of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, I need you, as my brother, to redeem my birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But you need to be somewhat richer in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You need to have some riches with which to redeem my birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then you pay the price to regain my birthright, and you also marry me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This means that you become involved with me.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This kind of spiritual involvement will produce Obed, the grandfather of David.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Boaz became one of the great forefathers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In a spiritual sense, he was the one who enjoyed the largest and richest portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If a brother becomes a Boaz to me, he will be the one with the greatest enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Because he redeemed my birthright and became so involved with me, our involvement in the Lord will eventually bring forth the full enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the church life today we need to have a number of Boazes.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The book of Ruth tells us that there was another kinsman who was even closer to Ruth than Boaz was.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But that man was selfish; he only took care of his own birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He was afraid that taking care of another s might mar his own.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is exactly today s situation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some brothers should take care of me, the poor Ruth, but they are selfish in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ it is quite possible to be selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, a Boaz will be generous and pay the price to redeem my birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All this indicates that we should take care of not only our own birthright, but also others birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Day by day we should take care of others enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The more we do this, the better.</S>
