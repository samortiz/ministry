   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS Date:February 27, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong THE IMPORTANCE OF SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both Brother Lee and I have felt that many brothers and sisters are lacking in spiritual consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order for God to have a way through the church, His children must recognize the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether or not a man knows the authority of the Holy Spirit depends on his spiritual consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he is lacking in spiritual consciousness, he will not know anything about the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if he speaks and acts in the most sincere way, he cannot be truly spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Something may appear spiritual outwardly but not be so in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must learn to discern this matter clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can see men as trees, and we can see a piano as an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, no tree can walk, and no organ will play like a piano.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are lacking in spiritual consciousness, we will never be submissive in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many people believe too much in their own eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They do not see, but they think that they have seen clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They cherish their own subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is hard to say the same thing twice to such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If none of the responsible brothers and sisters have any spiritual discernment and if they merely coordinate by assigning works to the different groups, they may think that they have a spiritual consciousness and that they are sincere in their coordination, but in reality they are in big trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today both Brother Witness and I have the same feeling that there is a lack of spiritual consciousness among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that all the brothers and sisters will learn to touch their spirit's feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They should learn to know what spiritual consciousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can explain red to a blind man all we want, but he will still not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if the entire population of Russia explains red to a blind man, he still would not know it because he has never seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are certain laws in the spiritual pathways.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The operation of the Holy Spirit can only be realized by those with spiritual consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is like saying that the Bible is God's breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the entire Bible can also become letter and form.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once spiritual consciousness is absent, the Bible becomes letter and form.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN SPIRIT AND THE LETTER</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is spirit, and what is the letter?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the difference between the feeling of the spirit and the knowledge derived from the mind or from one's judgment?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Bible the letter is not a good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The letter that Paul refers to in 2 Corinthians is the Old Testament Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the Old Testament is part of the Bible, it is nothing but letter if one does not touch it in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Something as good as the Bible can become letter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For something to be letter means that it was worked on by the Holy Spirit once, but the Spirit is no longer present when applied again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This makes it letter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, yesterday Brother Lee read two verses from the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You might have felt the voice of the Holy Spirit in that reading.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when you explain the same verse to another person, it is not under the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and it becomes nothing but letter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man can be in the book of Romans every day of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He can understand all the objective truths, but he cannot tell you when the Holy Spirit speaks or moves in him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To him, the book of Romans is the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He may wake up early every morning to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He may set aside time every day to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if these are merely rituals, he possesses nothing but the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although outwardly the spiritual shell is still present, inwardly nothing of the spirit is present.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must have a consciousness of the spirit within before we can release something of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only then will our words not be the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose Brother Lee read Romans 2:18-19 on the Lord's Day afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There might have been the spirit within Brother Lee, but there was not the consciousness of the spirit within me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I listened with my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, I only received the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If I want to touch the spirit, I must have the spirit myself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brother Lee had the spirit and the word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I listened, I had to have the spirit and the word as well.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only spiritual organs can realize spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The objective letter that Brother Lee read, when mingled with the spirit, became God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Subjectively, I have to understand his word with my mind, but I must also touch the spirit behind Brother Lee's word with my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If I do not touch the spirit behind the word, his word will only be letter to me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, this has nothing to do with whether or not a man's mind understands.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is a matter of whether or not we are touching the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may expound God's word clearly, and others may understand it perfectly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if we do not touch the spirit of God's word with our spirit, we have merely the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If a doctor operates on a patient in the way of letter, the sick man may turn into a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is more true in the spiritual realm.</S>
