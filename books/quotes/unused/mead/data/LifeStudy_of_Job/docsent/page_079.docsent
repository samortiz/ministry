   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will consider Elihu's first correction and refutation of Job</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. HIS ANGER BEING KINDLED A. Against Job</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The anger of Elihu was kindled against Job because he justified himself rather than God 32:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. Against Job's Three Friends</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Elihu's anger was kindled also against Job's three friends because they found no answer but had condemned Job v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Elihu thought of himself as wise, but in being angry against Job and his three friends he was very foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not wise to be burning with anger.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to learn to be slow to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are angry, we should not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Particularly in this matter of anger, we need to learn not to act in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we allow ourselves to calm down when we are angry, we will be saved from making foolish mistakes caused by speaking or acting in anger.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Elihu had waited to speak with Job because the others were all older than he vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>4-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verses 6 and 7 he said, "I am young,/And you are aged;/Therefore I shrank back and was afraid/To declare to you what I know./I said, Let age speak,/And let the multitude of years make wisdom known."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Following this, he declared that it is not the great who are wise nor the old who understand justice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then to these older ones Elihu said, "Hear me;/I too will declare what I know" v. 10 . Elihu's word here indicates that he was quite proud.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Elihu's detailed explanation in verses 11 through 13 is a further indication that he was lacking in wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a wise person says something, he speaks in a direct manner, without unnecessary words.</S>
