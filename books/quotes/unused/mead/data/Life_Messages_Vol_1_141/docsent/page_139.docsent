   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX IN OUR SPIRIT GOD'S GOOD PLEASURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Nothing is so neglected by Christians as our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In fact, most Christians are unaware that they have one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How many know that this is where regeneration transpires?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regeneration means having another life added to our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not merely having our behavior changed or our being renewed; even Confucius taught the need for that.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regeneration is a new birth, bringing the eternal, uncreated life of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is accomplished by the Spirit of God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our first birth is a marvel, but the second birth far exceeds it in wonder.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Who designed the intricate structure of the eye?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who formed our two ears?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot fathom how God forms all our parts in just nine months' time, so detailed and so well suited to their function.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet as wonderful as our natural birth is, our second birth is much more wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us answer some questions before we continue the message.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I come from a small locality and feel that I should have the habit of functioning in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But since we have been hearing how the meeting life must come out of our private life, I have had a problem about sharing because my private life is not that glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes I spend my time with the Lord sleeping on my Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then when I check in the meeting how my time with the Lord was, I feel as though if I say something, it will be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your habit of functioning in the meetings should be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not function out of habit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The proper church life surely depends upon our proper daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Day by day we need to live and walk in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This will result in some experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Come to the meetings with the riches you have experienced of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the meeting stay in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Don't decide to function or not to function.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Don't think you have to function according to your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As you stay in your spirit, when the time comes, the Spirit may impress you to function.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then you share in the spirit the riches you have experienced in your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Christian life must be a walk in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The riches in the meetings are the outflow of this daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In a certain meeting I was trying to sing a hymn with the saints, but the brother sitting next to me kept talking with me about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I found it very frustrating, because I was trying hard to be in the spirit and to get something out of the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I struggled to will myself to stay in my spirit and to love this brother, but I could not keep it up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How do our mind, emotion, and will interact to get us into the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as you are endeavoring and thinking how to handle your situation, you are outside the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are in your spirit, you will not be bothered by the interrupting brother.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You will not even pay that much attention to the singing of the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All your consideration of how to handle this brother is apart from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you remain in your spirit, you become the most simple person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Neither the singing nor the bothering brother affect you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In spirit you just join what you should join.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not to say that problems do not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But being in spirit is like being in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The problems do not upset you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I know it is not easy in the beginning to exercise this way, but we need to keep practicing.</S>
