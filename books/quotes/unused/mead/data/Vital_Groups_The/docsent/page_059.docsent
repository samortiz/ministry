   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE SIXTEEN HOW TO CONTACT PEOPLE 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that in all of our contact with people, we must cherish them with the goal of nourishing them with the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We ourselves must be constituted with the riches of Christ revealed in the Bible, if we are going to dispense these riches into others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible was first written, then translated, and finally interpreted and explained.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to our old way, many of us have been listening to messages interpreting the Bible for years, but when we go to contact people, we still do not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why I have shared that we need to follow the pattern of the saints in Taiwan to practice PSRP-pray-reading, studying, reciting, and prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All of this requires time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Pray-reading cannot be done lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we need to study the truths word by word, term by term, and phrase by phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For instance, John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then verse 14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many read these verses without understanding them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why we need the word to be interpreted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts 8 gives us a very good example of this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Ethiopian eunuch whom Philip contacted was reading from Isaiah, and Philip asked him, "Do you really know the things that you are reading?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The eunuch responded, "How could I unless someone guides me?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Philip interpreted the word to this eunuch, and he believed in the Lord and was baptized vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>35-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some people have said that all we need is the "pure Word," but how can we understand it?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 8 shows that we need the Word interpreted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our study equips us to interpret the Word to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By my study of the Word throughout the years, I saw that grace is God gained and enjoyed by us and reality is God realized by us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to gain Him, receive Him, and enjoy Him as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we have to realize Him as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although points like this have been made clear in our Life-study of the Bible, we may not pay attention to them to study them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to be constituted with the truth, we need to pray-read and then study.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Pray-reading verses such as John 1:1 and 14 lays a good foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we can study the crucial points of these verses with the help of the life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With this help we can find out what grace and reality are.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to study the truths word by word, term by term, and phrase by phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Spontaneously, we will be able to recite what we have pray-read and studied.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In addition to our personal study, we also need to study with others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of study cannot be carried out in big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It can be carried out mutually in vital group meetings of six to not more than ten saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have inherited much from the foregoing interpretations of the Word and have had a life-study of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the Lord has taken us further to have a crystallization-study.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this study I have to spend time not merely to present messages as I did with the life-study, but to present outlines.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to pray-read, study, recite, and prophesy with the points of these outlines.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are equipped to recite the outlines, we will spontaneously know how to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second point of outline one of the recent Thanksgiving conference says, "His Christ's humanity through His incarnation became a shell to conceal the glory of His divinity."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the beginning was the Word, who is God, this Word became flesh, and this flesh was a shell to conceal the glory of Christ's divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why the first banner of the conference says, "The glory of Christ's divinity was concealed in Him as in a grain of wheat."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The shell of the grain of wheat conceals the grain's life and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we prophesy with points like these, those whom we contact will want to hear what we say.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This new way of pray-reading, studying, reciting, and prophesying-PSRP-has been passed on to many places.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What I am speaking here is a kind of instruction to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My new way is PSRP.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the way for us to cook and to eat the riches which have been released in these recent years.</S>
