<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SONG OF MOSES</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Deut. 31:14-23, 30; 32:1-47</H1><P>In this message we will cover the song of Moses.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JEHOVAH COMMANDING MOSES TO WRITE A SONG</H2><P>In 31:14-23, 30 Jehovah commanded Moses to write a song.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Telling Moses<br>That His Days Drew Near for Him to Die</H2><P>In verse 14 Jehovah told Moses that his days drew near for him to die and that he should call Joshua to be with him in the tent of meeting that Jehovah might charge him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah Appearing in a Pillar of Cloud<br>and Telling Moses That This People Would<br>Rise Up and Go as Harlots after the Strange Gods<br>of the Land Which They Were Entering<br>and Would Forsake Him and Break His Covenant</H2><P>Jehovah appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud, which stood over the entrance of the tent, and told Moses that he was about to lie down with his fathers, that this people would rise up and go as harlots after the strange gods of the land which they were entering, and that they would forsake Him and break His covenant (vv. 15-16). His anger would burn against them, and He would hide His face from them (v. 17a). They would be devoured, and many evils and troubles would befall them because of all the evil they had done, for they turned to other gods (vv. 17b-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Charging Moses to Write This Song<br>and Teach It to the Children of Israel and Put It<br>in Their Mouth, That He Might Have This Song as<br>a Witness against the Children of Israel</H2><P>Jehovah charged Moses to write this song and teach it to the children of Israel and put it in their mouth, that He might have this song as a witness against the children of Israel (v. 19). Jehovah would bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, and they would eat and become satisfied and grow fat, and they would turn to other gods and serve them and despise Jehovah and break His covenant (v. 20). When many evils and troubles befell them, this song would respond as a witness before them because it would not be forgotten in the mouth of their seed; for He knew their intention before He brought them into the land (v. 21). So Moses wrote this song and taught it to the children of Israel (v. 22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jehovah's Charge to Joshua</H2><P>In verse 23 Jehovah charged Joshua and said, "Be strong and take courage, for you will bring the children of Israel into the land which I have sworn to them; and I will be with you."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Moses Speaking to All the Congregation of Israel<br>the Words of This Song</H2><P>Moses spoke to all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were completed (v. 30).</P>
