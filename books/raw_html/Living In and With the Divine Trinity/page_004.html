<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Determined Counsel of the Triune God</H2><P>Acts 2:23 says that Christ was delivered up by the determined counsel of [the Triune] God (see note 1 of verse 23&#151; Recovery Version). Among the Three of the Godhead, there was a council, and by this council a determined counsel was made. The Wuest translation of the New Testament says that Christ was delivered up by the counsel of God "in the council held by the Trinity." The determined counsel was made by the Triune God, who had held a divine council. The three-one God made a decision that the Son had to become a man and be crucified on the cross. The crucifixion of Christ was a fulfillment of God's determined counsel in eternity without beginning.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Father Choosing Us in the Son<br>before the Foundation of the World</H2><P>The Father of our Lord [the Son] chose us in Christ [the Son] before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:3-4). The Father chose us, but He did it in Christ, the Son. He did not choose us directly. God the Father chose us in Christ as the element, the sphere, and the channel. Thus, in eternity past the Triune God was there fellowshipping, loving, foreordaining, working, and choosing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN CREATION</H2><P>Genesis 1:1 reveals that [the Triune] God created the universe. The Hebrew word for "God" in this verse, Elohim, is plural in number. The subject "God" is plural, and the predicate "created" is singular. The plural God created the heavens and the earth. The Three of the Godhead were creating; then Genesis 1:2 mentions the Spirit of God. It says that the Spirit of God was brooding upon the face of the waters (ASV&#151;note). The Triune God's Spirit was brooding upon the face of the waters just like a hen brooding over its eggs.</P><P>The Triune God can also be seen in the creation of man. God said, "Let us make man in our [the Triune God's] image" (Gen. 1:26); so "God created man in his own [His Son's] image" (Gen. 1:27). God's own image is the Son's image. This is proved by Colossians 1:15, which tells us that Christ is the image of the invisible Triune God. Hebrews 1:3 says that the Son is the express image of God's substance. Thus, we can see that the Divine Trinity was working in creation.</P>
