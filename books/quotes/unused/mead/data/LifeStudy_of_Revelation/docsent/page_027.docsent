   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. His Believers Being Born into the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The believers of Jesus have been born into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 3:5 proves this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse, Jesus said to Nicodemus, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were regenerated into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How could we have entered into the kingdom by regeneration if the kingdom had been suspended?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Into what, then, were we born again?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As John 3 states clearly, we have been reborn into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>C. The Church Life Today Being the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Matthew 16:18 and 19 the Lord said to Peter, On this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows that, in a proper sense, the church is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 14:17 also indicates that we in the church are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The proper church life is the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the heavenly rule in the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all have been regenerated with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this life there is the divine nature, and with this divine nature there is a ruling, a reigning, a governing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This governing is both divine and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We, the regenerated ones, are under this reign today; we are under this government and control.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to exercise this rule over ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you still need someone else to rule over you, it means that you are fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be under the heavenly rule in everything we do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In a previous message we spoke about being the fighting army of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if you are not under the ruling of the divine life, you will never be selected to be in His army.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being chosen to be in this army depends upon obeying the heavenly rule in the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The divine life brings us into the divine kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The kingdom into which we are reborn in John 3:5 is the very kingdom mentioned by John in Revelation 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How could we ever be joint partakers in the kingdom if we had not been reborn into it?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After we have been reborn into the kingdom, we should remain in it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you still argue with your wife or husband, it means that you are an escapee from the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you remain in the kingdom and live in it, you will never fight with your husband, your wife, or anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the enemy may tempt you to fight, the ruling of the heavenly kingdom will restrain you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>D. His Believers Suffering Persecution</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>for the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be in the kingdom in Jesus today is not a glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the kingdom in Jesus becomes the kingdom in Christ, that will be the time for glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today, the kingdom in Jesus is a kingdom of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Matthew 5:10-12 the Lord said that His believers suffer persecution for the sake of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are suffering for righteousness sake, then we are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are certain things which we cannot do because they are unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All of humanity today is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we agree with this unrighteousness, people will welcome us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we stand for righteousness, people will oppose and persecute us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suffering persecution for the kingdom proves that we are in the kingdom of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not think that it is a glory to be in the kingdom today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No, to be in the kingdom now is to bear shame and to suffer persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more we are in the kingdom, the more we shall suffer and be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But praise the Lord this suffering is a strong sign that we are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Being in the kingdom today is a matter of being in the suffering in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although we are joint partakers in the kingdom in Jesus, we are not yet the co-kings in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When He comes back, we shall be His co-kings in the kingdom in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At that time, we shall no longer suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not say to others, You must honor me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am a partner in the heavenly kingdom, and one day I ll be a co-king with Christ in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more you say this, the more you will be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today is not a reigning day but a suffering day.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we are not in the reigning kingdom but in the suffering kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the reason that Paul said that we must enter into the kingdom of God through much tribulation Acts 14:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The way to enter into the ruling kingdom is through suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The tribulation Paul referred to in Acts 14:22 was mainly the persecution at the hands of the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All believers in Christ undergo this kind of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul seemed to be saying, You Christians, the believers of Jesus, must suffer persecution from the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In principle, it is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If there were no religion in the world today, we would not suffer as much persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As we have already pointed out, most of the troubles, persecutions, rumors, and oppositions can be traced to one source religion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>While we are suffering today, we are in the kingdom where we are being exercised, trained, prepared, and qualified to be Christ s army and to reign in His kingdom as His co-kings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>JOINT PARTAKER</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>IN THE ENDURANCE IN JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In 1:9, John also said that he was a joint partaker in the endurance in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>For both the tribulation and the kingdom we need endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many saints, even among us in the Lord s recovery, lack endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some have suffered persecution from their relatives, friends, and neighbors, but eventually they exhausted their supply of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>While they were able to withstand the persecution for a certain time, they lacked the endurance to bear it for a longer time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He endured persecution Heb 12:2-3 , and He is still enduring men s opposition and reproach today.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Consider how much, even today, people oppose and mock the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the one hand, He is sitting in the heavens; on the other hand, He is still being mocked, opposed, and persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many of us might expect the Lord Jesus to say to His mockers, Repent or I will send a great earthquake to destroy you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Lord Jesus has been mocked for nearly twenty centuries, but He has not fought back.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, He has continuously suffered all these attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some may say, Jesus, I hate You, but there is no response from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the endurance of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Not many of us have heard of the endurance of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have heard of the power of Jesus, the love of Jesus, the holiness of Jesus, the righteousness of Jesus, but not of the endurance of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Nevertheless, as we live in Christ, we not only partake of His life and holiness, but also of His endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we abide in Christ, we partake of His endurance and have the endurance to bear suffering and opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord s word is even called the word of endurance 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Today the whole world is opposing and rejecting Him, but He does not fight back.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He simply endures it all.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Now as we have fellowship with Him and abide in Him, we partake of His endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As His followers, we must follow Him on the same pathway with endurance Heb 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In this way we also can endure persecution, rumors, rejection, and opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is a strong proof that we are those who are waiting for the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>As we wait for His coming back by being a joint partaker in His tribulation, kingdom, and endurance, we are being disciplined, trained, prepared, and qualified to be His fighting army.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Are you waiting for the Lord Jesus to come back?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you are, then you also must be a joint partaker in His tribulation, kingdom, and endurance.</S>
