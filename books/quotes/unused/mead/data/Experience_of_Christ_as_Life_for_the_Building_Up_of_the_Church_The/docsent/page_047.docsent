   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE ANOINTING OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE COMPOUND SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Exo 30:23-26, 29, 30; 2 Cor 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have pointed out that the aspects of the Spirit mentioned in 2 Corinthians are different from those mentioned in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that there are different kinds of experiences of the same Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Corinthians the Spirit is the revealing, gift-dispensing, and indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But 2 Corinthians shows us some deeper experiences of the same Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that in this second Epistle there are nine aspects of the substantial and subjective work of the Holy Spirit within us: the anointing, sealing, guaranteeing, writing, life-giving, ministering, liberating, transforming, and transmitting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ultimately, the Spirit transmits all that Christ is with the fullness of the Godhead into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These aspects are very deep, substantial, and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this chapter we would like to say more concerning the anointing aspect of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament we are told that we have a wonderful thing called the anointing 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has anointed us and has attached us unto the anointed One 2 Cor 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The anointed One is Christ, the Son of God, whom God has anointed above all His partners, His companions Heb 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By being attached to Him we all have been anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we share the anointing from the Holy One.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This anointing abides in us and teaches us in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The anointing is the moving of the ointment, the moving of the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to consider the difference between oil and ointment, because both of them typify the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Exodus 30 speaks of both olive oil and the compound ointment vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The oil is composed of only one element, the element of the olive, but the ointment is composed of oil plus a number of elements.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The compound ointment is composed of one basic element, olive oil, blended and compounded together with four kinds of spices.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This compound ointment in Exodus 30 is a wonderful picture and type of the all-inclusive, compound Spirit in the New Testament Phil 1:19 .</S>
