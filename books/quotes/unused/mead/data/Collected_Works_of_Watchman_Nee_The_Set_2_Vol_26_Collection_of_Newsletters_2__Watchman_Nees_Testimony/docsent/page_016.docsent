   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question:If a believer's wife does not believe and the believer allows her to prepare the demonic feast when it is their turn to care for the family worship of demons, or if a believer's father and mother are not believers and he cannot stop them from worshipping demons, does the believer have a part in either of these two sins of idolatry?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Answer:The husband is the head of the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The wife should obey the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the husband allows her to sin, it is as if he had sinned himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Children should obey their parents and not control them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The children cannot be held accountable for the parents' sin in worshipping idols.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The two stand in different positions Eph 5:22; 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the believer should stay far away from matters of idolatry demonic feasts .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mr. Nee, please read through the answers to these questions about idols and publish them in Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The local government here has recently set up a militia.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Can the believers refuse to join it?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a matter of law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I hope you will study this and give us some advice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Greetings to Mr. Chang Kuang Hsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Additional Note from Wang Yu T'ing</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Note from Watchman: Brother Wang's answers concerning the matter of idols are very correct.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We believers should keep ourselves from doing these things which bring on the Lord's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I deeply believe that even if we lose something of a worldly inheritance, God will bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Read Hebrews 13:5-6.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With regard to the matter of the militia, we must remember: 1 We should obey those with authority over us Rom 13:1 ; 2 we cannot kill, even in war Matt 26:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, when our country organizes a militia, we cannot disobey.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, we cannot go to war for any reason.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, I think:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1 If they require us to be trained, we can go; but when there is a war, we cannot fight.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2 Our training invariably leads to conscription so that when there is a war, we will be forced to go against our will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It would be better for us to not attend the training at all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3 If we believers cannot obey the authority by fulfilling the law, then we should obey our country by accepting the punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They may have a severe penalty of a jail sentence or a fine for those who do not enter the militia, but we should obey them in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brothers, we must be faithful unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not procrastinate in regard to our testimony for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A LETTER FROM BROTHER LUKE HSUAN</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Tu:</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have enclosed the draft of a letter I wrote recently for the purpose of leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please look it over and notify the responsible brothers or all the brothers so that they will know that I am definitely walking in the same way with you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May the Almighty Lord lead me, as a weak and useless little lamb, to go on, and may He cover and protect me until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>May the Lord bless you!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Luke Hsuan</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>July 23</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Mr. Pastor and the saints called in grace together by the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After being called in grace by the Lord, He enlightened me to know that a Christian is already in His name and cannot take on another name i.e., Anglican .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, a wife cannot add another man's name on to her husband's name.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If she does this, what kind of woman is she?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In addition, the Lord has shown us how much the denominations have deviated from the clear teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He hates: 1 divisions 1 Cor 1:10-13 ; 2 the flesh, which is according to the fashion of the world 3:3-5 ; and 3 factions, works of the flesh Gal 5:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to obey the Lord, I have especially written this letter to ask you to strike my name from your record.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From now on I have no relationship with the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps you will not agree with this action, but I still hope that you will be noble Bereans and search the Scripture to see whether or not this doctrine is right.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May the Almighty Lord bless you personally.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A Christian,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hsuan Hsiang Pao</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I believed and was baptized in 1927 under the name of Hsiang Pao or Ling Sheng.</S>
