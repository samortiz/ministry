   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RAISING A FLOCK OF LAMBS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would emphasize the fact that if we would raise Christ as a lamb, we must first have Him as the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I know from experience that when we raise Christ as a bull for a sin offering, we also raise Him as a lamb for a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Offering Christ as the sin offering is the way to raise Christ as a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 14:1 says, And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As part of a description of the hundred and forty-four thousand with the Lamb, Revelation 14:4 says, These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a strong verse related to growing Christ as a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who are faithful follow the Lamb wherever He goes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To follow Christ as the Lamb is to raise Him as a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, we shall raise Christ as a flock of lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This does not mean, of course, that there is more than one Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is uniquely one, but in our experience we may have Him in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, experientially we may raise Christ as a flock of lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To understand a matter in a doctrinal way is one thing, but to view the same matter experientially is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regarding Christ, I do not want to remain merely in doctrine, but I long to have the adequate spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who care primarily for doctrine often oppose those believers with experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Toward the end of the last century and in the first part of this century, certain Bible teachers criticized Andrew Murray because he emphasized experience more than doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His books on spiritual experience have been helpful to thousands of seeking Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His masterpiece is The Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have received great help from this book, and I encourage you all not only to read it, but also to study it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apart from the writings in the Lord s recovery, no book other than The Spirit of Christ has been so helpful to Christians in knowing Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, Andrew Murray has been condemned by certain Bible teachers, in particular by some of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, Jessie Penn-Lewis has also been severely criticized by these same Bible teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Years ago, a certain bookstore in China sold all of Brother Nee s books with the exception of The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who operated this bookstore knew that one chapter in The Spiritual Man was a translation of Mrs. Penn-Lewis writings on spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They regarded that book as unclean because it contained a portion of her writings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although thousands of believers have been helped by the writings of Jessie Penn-Lewis, some who focus on doctrine condemned her not only as a heretic, but even as a witch.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we speak about raising Christ as a flock of lambs, we are talking about our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My concern here is not merely with teaching the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With the Bible as my basis, I wish to speak concerning the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, speaking from the experiential point of view, I would say that we can have Christ as a flock of lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In ancient times, the children of Israel brought the firstlings of their flocks and of their herds to Mount Zion to offer to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All these firstlings typified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have pointed out that Christ is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in our experience we may have Christ in many different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is only one Christ, but the experiences of Christ are countless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE OFFERINGS FOR GOD S EATING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have seen the way to raise Christ as a bull for the sin offering and as lambs for the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Exodus 29 the lamb is not for propitiation; rather, the lamb is a burnt offering as food for God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was offered to God for Him to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many Christians have never heard that Christ may be offered not only for propitiation, but also as food for God s eating.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those with some knowledge of theology may wonder about this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, according to the Bible, certain offerings were not for atonement, not for propitiation, but were for God s eating.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is clearly portrayed in Exodus 29.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this chapter the bull was offered as a sin offering; that is, it was offered for propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The lambs, however, were offered to God for His eating.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this reason, Exodus 29 does not mention blood with respect to the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The blood is for redeeming, for propitiation, and for atonement; it is not for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the lambs offered as the burnt offering were wholly for God to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do you know by what way God eats His food?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God eats with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When God comes to eat the food you have prepared for Him, He will eat it by His holy, consuming fire.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Perhaps you have never heard before that fire is the means by which God eats His food.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now we know how to raise Christ as a bull for a sin offering and as a lamb for a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The whole lamb was burned.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that it was absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No part of the lamb of the burnt offering was for the offerer or for the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The lamb was God s food and was entirely for His eating.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we continue to practice offering Christ as our sin offering, we shall live by Christ as the lamb, as the One obedient to God and meek before man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then in the meetings we shall have Christ as many lambs to offer to God as food for His satisfaction.</S>
