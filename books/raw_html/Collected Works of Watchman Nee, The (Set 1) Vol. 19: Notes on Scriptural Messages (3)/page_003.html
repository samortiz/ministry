<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE CORPORATE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 45</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:13; Rom. 9:3; 1 John 4:7; James 4:7; Eph. 5:22-24; 1 Cor. 12:25; Eph. 5:21; Hosea 7:8</H1><P>During the past few days I have been paying attention to one thing, which is what a Christian has to be in order to be a cake that is turned. What is a cake that is not turned? It is one that has heat on one side and no heat on the other side. To be a turned cake is to be cooked on both sides. This is a great principle in the Bible. In many matters a Christian has to pay attention to both sides. If he pays attention to only one side, he will be like a cake not turned. One side will be either burned and overcooked, and the other side will still be watery and uncooked. If the sisters have vegetables or meat that are burned on one side and raw on the other side, it means that the food has not been turned. Please remember that it is most important to be turned. Anything that is not turned is burned on one side and raw on the other. The meaning of being turned is to pay attention to both sides. A person should pay attention to one side as well as to the other. He should learn from one side as well as from the other.</P><P>The message this afternoon may not be a principle of spiritual life, but it is a principle of a believers' daily living. This principle is the balance between the corporate life and the individual life. On one hand, we have to pay attention to the corporate life. On the other hand, we have to pay attention to the individual life. On one hand, we are members. But on the other hand, we are also the Body. This is why we have to pay attention to our life as members and to our life in the Body. We are not alone but with all the ones who constitute the Body.</P><P>In the Catholic Church today, all the authority rests in the hands of the pope; all Catholics listen to the pope. There is no such thing as sects with them. But Protestantism with five hundred or more years of history had, by a few decades ago, over fifteen hundred sects. Since then, there may be even more. The Catholic Church is unified, and from the first day until now, everyone has been following the orders of the pope. Catholics are very obedient to the pope. But with Protestants, there are many sects, each with its own beliefs and ideas. Catholics have gone to one extreme; the conscience of the individual is not important and everyone simply follows the pope. Protestants, on the other hand, only care for their own conscience and ignore the views of others. Once a few people develop a different view, they put up a sign and start another group. The result is many denominations. Catholicism is an unturned cake, and Protestantism is also an unturned cake.</P><P>The Bible is in between these two extremes. It speaks of personal liberty, the voice of the conscience, and it also speaks of listening to others and submitting one to another. We are the Body; yet at the same time, we are the members. Every one of us should be an independent individual in this world. At the same time, every one of us should submit to other brothers and sisters. We have to maintain our life as members and also maintain the Body life. We have to pay attention to the corporate life and also pay attention to the individual life. If we pay attention to one aspect only, we will become an unturned cake. If we only pay attention to others and do not have any ideas of our own, we will become an unturned cake. Before God, we have to pay attention to the individual as well as to the Body. Today we will mention some differences between the individual life and the corporate life, but you have to excuse me for not being able to go into detail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. "WHETHER WE WERE BESIDE OURSELVES,<br>IT WAS TO GOD;<br>OR WHETHER WE ARE SOBER-MINDED,<br>IT IS FOR YOU"<br>(2 CORINTHIANS 5:13)</H2><P>Being beside ourselves is being crazy; we do this to God. But we are sober-minded for others. On one hand, this is very personal; on the other hand, this is very corporate. Being beside ourselves is a personal matter. Being sober-minded is a corporate matter. For example, a person may study the Bible by himself in the morning. He may receive some light from the Lord and unconsciously hit the table a few times. There is nothing wrong with this. While I am standing here today, if I hit the table when I think of a verse, would you not say that I am unsound? Paul was beside himself before God but sober-minded before men. If you are alone by yourself, you can hit the table or chair and be beside yourself with joy before God. But if you are before men, you have to be sober-minded. Many people are bound before God; it seems that they do not know how to pray. Actually, a person's heart should be as hot as possible before God. When we are before God by ourselves, we can be very free and jump up and down in an ecstatic way or shout "hallelujah" all the time. But if you are in a meeting and others are with you, or someone can hear you in the next room, you cannot shout and cry as you wish. You have to be sober-minded before men. I may be speaking too frankly, but this is the teaching of the Bible. Paul said that we can be beside ourselves only before God, while before men we have to be sober-minded.</P><P>An unseemly thing today is that men display the ecstasy that they should have before God to others. The Bible never permits this. Can you pray when you are in your room with only your underwear and no socks? We all can do this. But if you are in a meeting, you surely cannot pray this way. What you can do before God may not necessarily be permissible before men. We still have to be sober-minded before men for their sake.</P><P>What is the meaning of being sober-minded? Being sober- minded is being careful and having self-restraint. Being sober-minded is being polite; it is not being crazy, but proper. If you never pray by yourself and only pray in front of men, and if you never read the Bible in your own room and only read in front of people, you are like a shop that exhibits every item of its merchandise and has nothing left in the warehouse. This is not being beside yourself before God; it is living a fallen life, one that God will never bless. There is the need for soberness before men. There is also the need for being beside ourselves before God. If we do both, we are a turned cake.</P><P>If I lived in a rural place with no one around me, not even shepherds or ranchers, I could shout and pray as loud as I wanted. If I did this, no one would touch me. But I live in Wen-teh Lane. Even though I live in a room by myself, my neighbors would think that I am sick or that someone had died in my room if I suddenly shouted in the middle of the night. Please remember that a person can only be beside himself before God; he must take care of soberness before men. You have to learn to be sober before men and beside yourself before God. Many people are sober before God and men. They are lifeless before men and God. Paul was beside himself before God, but he was very unassuming before men. The letters he wrote were serious in their tone, yet when he met men face to face, he was very unassuming. He was very normal. We should learn to be beside ourselves before God and sober before men.</P><P>A few years ago when I was sick, I went for some rest to the place of a brother, who was very good in prayer. His room was next to my room but I often could not sleep at night because of my fever and bodily weakness. I noticed once that a light was on in his room. When I knocked at his door and asked why he was not in bed, he told me that he was about to go to bed. After a while I went over to see him again, and he was still not in bed. He finally went to sleep about two o'clock in the morning. I am not against praying the whole night, but you should remember that you can only be beside yourself before God. If you are beside yourself before men, others will not be able to stand you. You may not need to sleep, but others do. You may want to stay up late, but others do not. When I saw him the next day, I said, "Brother, I am not saying this because I did not sleep well last night. But if you continue to do what you are doing, it will not be good for you and for others." He did not believe my words. Later, he began to vomit blood. Before God, we can be beside ourselves. But if we are beside ourselves before men, we are an unturned cake.</P><P>Brothers, please do not be offended by my frank words. I hope that you will take care of both sides. On one hand, we should be lively before God. On the other hand, we should be very normal before men. If you want to be a special Christian, only be one before God. Do not exhibit all your treasures before men. Do not speak with a special tone of voice or walk in a special kind of way. We should act very normal before men. We should wear what others wear and eat what others eat. We have to be a turned cake. If we are beside ourselves before God and men, we are an unturned cake. We have to realize that both aspects are precious. God is pleased with both. We have to be zealous before God and normal before men.</P><P>The brother that I spoke of earlier was married. I have asked others about this brother. I have been told that his wife will fix a meal and he will not come to the table. He will not eat his lunch at noon and sometimes does not even come by two o'clock. At five or six o'clock in the afternoon, someone still has to remind him to take his lunch. He is beside himself before God, but he is not very sober before men. This is not the right attitude for a Christian. Do not think that just because you are zealous, you can eat lunch at six o'clock in the afternoon. If you are all alone, you can have lunch at midnight, but if your wife and others are waiting, you should keep the time. You cannot discard manners before men. On one hand, we should be as zealous as possible before God, but on the other hand, we should do our best to take care of the brothers and sisters when we are among men.</P>
