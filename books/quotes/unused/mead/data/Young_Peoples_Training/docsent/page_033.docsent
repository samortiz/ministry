   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today, the Holy Spirit is the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This enables us to understand John 7:37-39.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to quote these verses: Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit mentioned in these verses is the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit of God was there from the very beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but the compounded Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that at that time Jesus had not been crucified and resurrected and had not ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not until Jesus had been crucified and resurrected and had ascended to the heavens that the compounding of the anointing oil was accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since Jesus resurrection and ascension, the Holy Spirit has been the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is included in this compound Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everything is here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The compound Spirit includes the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the compound Spirit we have the number one, the Creator, and the number four, the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This Spirit also includes Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It contains the effectiveness of the death of Christ and the power of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Recall that the measures of the cinnamon and the calamus denote the splitting of the second of the Triune God on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How much is contained in the compound Spirit: the divine nature, the human nature, the Creator, the creature, the Triune God, death, resurrection, ascension, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is wise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If He merely taught us about this, it would be difficult for Him to explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everybody knows that a picture is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How much easier it is, for example, to look at my head than to describe it in writing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Likewise, due to our weakness, it is difficult for God to tell us what the compound Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, in His wisdom, He used the picture, the symbol, of the anointing oil in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you would know the compound Spirit, you must consider the compounded anointing oil in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not a doctrine; it can be confirmed by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This holy anointing oil that abides in us contains God Himself and the humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It contains the killing power to cross us out, and it also has the resurrection power to enliven us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, it contains the intensified ability to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All this is here in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we have this compound Spirit, our daily living, our daily cooking, becomes filled with sweet spices.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christianity today is truly poverty stricken.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christians lack both the proper knowledge and the adequate experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But thank the Lord that through the past fifty years He has not only shown us many things, but He has also caused us to experience them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I experienced the compound Spirit before I saw the light regarding this matter in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day, after having considerable experience, I read Exodus 30 again, and everything became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I first began to say that the death of the Lord Jesus is included in the Spirit, one of my co-workers, being a little cautious, said that it is not so right to say that the Lord s death is included in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That was in 1954.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I took this brother s advice and spent much time with the Lord, asking Him what term I should use.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord said that it was better to say that the effectiveness of the Lord s death is included in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I told that brother that from now on I would not say that the death of Christ is included in the Holy Spirit, but that the effectiveness of the death of Christ is included in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At that time, I had not seen Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This chapter was not opened to me until approximately eight years ago in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After receiving this light from the Bible, I gave definitions of all the items related to the anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since that time, I have had more utterance to speak of the compound Spirit.</S>
