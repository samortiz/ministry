<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SECRET OF LIVING, WALKING,<br>AND HAVING OUR BEING IN AND ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXPERIENCING LIFE IN THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Now we need to spend some time to see how to experience life in the spirit. The experience of life is absolutely a matter in the two spirits: the divine Spirit and the human spirit. The Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the life-giving Spirit. He is the Spirit of life as the breath and the Spirit of power as the wind. This Spirit is both God and Christ. God, Christ, and the Spirit are one. They are not three Gods. They are the Triune God, one God with three mysterious and wonderful Persons. The Triune God became a man. He died on the cross, was buried, resurrected, and then He ascended to the heavens where He was enthroned and crowned with glory and honor. After all these accomplishments and attainments, He came down as the Spirit of power, the all-inclusive, mighty, living Spirit.</P><P>From that time He began to work and to move to gain His chosen people. His people were all chosen before the foundation of the world in eternity (Eph. 1:4). After He accomplished all things for His economy, He came down as the all-inclusive Spirit. He is the breath and the wind. He is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. He is the Spirit who gives life and the Spirit of power. As such a Spirit He picks up all His chosen people and puts them into Himself to make them one Body. In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13). By this baptism the Body was produced and the new man was born. Now our life today is the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit.</P><P>Our spirit is the central part of our being. When we live in our body, we are a very shallow person in the flesh. When we live in our soul, we are deeper, but still not so deep. We need to live in our spirit, the deepest part of our being. We may be sincere in our soul, but this sincerity is not the deepest sincerity. Our sincerity should be in our spirit. Our spirit is the deepest part of our being.</P><P>When we called on the Lord Jesus for the first time, we were saved. At that time the Lord Jesus as the divine Spirit, the Spirit of life and power, the life-giving Spirit as the all-inclusive Spirit, came into our spirit and we were regenerated. That which is born of the divine Spirit is our human spirit (John 3:6b). Our human spirit was regenerated by the divine Spirit, who is the realization of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. He came into our spirit and remains here to be our life. In our spirit we have the divine Person as our life.</P><P>Before we were saved, we did not have a life in our spirit. But now that we are saved, the divine Person, the divine Spirit, who is Christ Himself, is in our spirit to remain here and be our life. The divine Spirit is with our spirit, and these two spirits have become one spirit. This is why 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit." We are one spirit with the Lord. Our oneness with Him is not in our flesh or in our soul but in our spirit. Today Christ as the divine Spirit lives and stays in our spirit. Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit."</P><P>Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God. When we consider how poor we are, we may wonder how we can be the children of God. This is a doubt from our mental consideration. But when we turn to our spirit, we have the witness and the assurance that we are the children of God. If we were not the children of God, we would not call God "Abba, Father" (Rom. 8:15). The mind may doubt, but the spirit cries, "Abba, Father!" We have the assurance that we are the children of God, not in our mind, but in our spirit. We have to learn the lesson of rejecting the doubts in our mind and praising the Father from our spirit.</P><P>The Triune God is the all-inclusive Spirit within our spirit as our life. He stays here, dwells here, lives here, moves here, and acts here. The center of God's salvation is that this all-inclusive Spirit, who is Christ and God, is dwelling, living, moving, and acting in our spirit as our life. We are one with Him in our spirit.</P>
