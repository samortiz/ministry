   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PSALM 76 THE VICTORY OF GOD IN HIS DWELLING PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 76 tells us that God's dwelling place is where God defeats His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the arrangement of all the Psalms, this signifies that the defeat of the enemies of God follows the desolation, just as Psalm 76 follows Psalm 74.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This certainly fits today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today, after the desolation of the church, God is defeating His enemies in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 1 and 2: "In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Salem means peaceful, perfect and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is where God's tabernacle is located.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Zion means a fortress, or safety.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore Salem signifies peace, and Zion speaks of the safety of a fortress.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here in God's dwelling place we have peace, and here we have safety.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 3: "There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Selah."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must underline the word "there."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is in God's dwelling place, in the local churches, that God defeats and destroys His enemy and smashes all his instruments of war.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 4: "Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The desolaters of God's sanctuary are the mountains of prey, but Zion is more excellent and more glorious than all the desolaters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not forget that all these Psalms are written in poetic form; hence, we must understand them in a poetic way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now let us put all these four Psalms together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Psalm 73 we see the personal sufferings of the seeking saints, then in Psalm 74, the desolation of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Psalm 75 speaks of Christ's intervening to judge the desolaters, and Psalm 76 declares the victory of God in His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Firstly, God strips His seeking saints of material things to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Secondly, they have seen the desolation of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thirdly, they have come to know God's intention that they may enjoy Him in an absolute way and then enjoy the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's house has lain desolate for so long because they failed to give God's Anointed the proper and pre-eminent position.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Fourthly, at the set time God's Anointed will come in to deal with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Fifthly, God's victory is in His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is in the church as the city that God defeats all His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must still come back to the dwelling place of God, to Salem, to Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Salem is peace, and Zion is safety; so it is there that we have peace and safety.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Altogether, in these four Psalms we see that the enjoyment of the house of God depends entirely upon the position Christ is given among God's people.</S>
