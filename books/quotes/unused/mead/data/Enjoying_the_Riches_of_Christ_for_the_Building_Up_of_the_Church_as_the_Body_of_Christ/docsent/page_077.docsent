   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR THE ALTAR, ALERTNESS, AND THE PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The returned ones did not firstly rebuild the temple; they firstly rebuilt the altar Ezra 3:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to have the rebuilding of the church life, we need first to have an absolute consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before building up the church, first set up the altar and put all things on it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This sequence is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The altar signifies consecration and absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The altar means that everything is absolutely for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Put everything on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The altar is not only for the trespass offering; it is mainly for the burnt offering to be offered morning and evening, daily, continually, and willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before a strong church can be built up in a city, the first thing we must rebuild is the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to put everything on the altar what we are, what we do, what we are able to do, what we have, and what we are for.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must be definite and absolute to put everything on the altar, reserving nothing for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Ezra, they first built the altar and offered on it daily, and then they laid the foundation of the temple vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>8-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the first temple was built, the people rejoiced when it was completed, but with the rebuilt temple, they did not wait until it was completed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the time when only the foundation was laid, the people became "crazy."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is because for the rebuilding, the foundation is more important.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After the foundation was laid, the subtle ones came in 4:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today the situation is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must always be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some may come and say that they will help us in the recovery, the rebuilding, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must be careful to not receive their word too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Ezra 4, the returned ones told the subtle ones, "You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to Jehovah the God of Israel" v. 3 . Some may say that we are too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not that we are narrow; it is that we know the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Ezra 4, the subtle ones were frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After laying the foundation, the people did not start right away to build the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They needed the prophets to come in to help them 5:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today in principle it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to be absolute and on the alert, and we need the prophets to come in to strengthen us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE RECOVERY BEING FOR THE LORD'S GLORY, THE ENEMY'S SHAME, AND OUR FULL SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I look to the Lord that we may see that today is a day not of revival but of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord today does not care much for revival.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He cares for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be recovered means to come back to the spirit, and to come back to the spirit means to come back to the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must give up anything that divides.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regardless of how good a teaching, gift, or practice may be, as along as it is divisive, we must drop it and come back to the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The divisions are a shame to the Lord and a boast for the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we must drop any kind of divisive factor and come back to the spirit to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not care for any doctrine, practice, or gift.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We care only for the oneness in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the way to have the rebuilding of the Lord's temple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the Lord's recovery, and it is a glory to the Lord and a shame to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is also our full satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have the full satisfaction in our spirit because we realize that we are in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Again I say, today is a day of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What we need is not a revival, but a return to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here and there, in all the big cities in the United States and in all the leading countries on this earth, the Lord will recover His church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will be a real shame to the enemy, and this will pave the way for the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the church is recovered and rebuilt, the Lord will come back with His glory as the Bridegroom to meet the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a glory to Him and a real and full satisfaction to us.</S>
