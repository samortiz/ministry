   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE THE SIGNS IN JOHN TWENTY-ONE 1 Scripture Reading: John 21:1-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many years ago I wondered why chapter twenty-one was included at the end of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I thought that this chapter was too simple to be the last chapter in a book that covers profound, divine, and mysterious things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But eventually I came to understand that without such a chapter, we would not know how to experience in a practical way the divine and mysterious things revealed in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter one of the Gospel of John, we have the eternal Word, which was with God and was even God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This eternal Word became flesh and lived on earth to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, He went to the cross and died there to accomplish God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He took away the sin of the world, He judged the world, He cast out Satan, the ruler of the world, He dealt with our serpentine nature, and He released the divine life from within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All this was accomplished as a result of the Lord's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In resurrection the Lord brought us into the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, through His resurrection we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to chapter twenty, in resurrection the Lord came back in the form of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, He became the pneumatic Christ, and as this pneumatic Christ He breathed Himself into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the wonderful revelation of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would ask you to consider the last two verses of chapter twenty: "Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It seems that these verses are the conclusion of this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many readers of the Gospel of John may have the feeling that they have come to the conclusion of this book when they have completed chapter twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if we consider this matter more carefully, we shall realize that there is the need of a concluding chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THREE PRACTICAL QUESTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have seen that in chapters one through twenty we have a revelation of the eternal Word becoming flesh to accomplish everything related to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After dying an all-inclusive death, this One became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and as the Spirit He breathed Himself into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although this is marvelous, up to this point nothing has been said concerning our practical living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How are we to live?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How should we earn a living?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peter may have taken the lead to ask, "Lord Jesus, it is wonderful that You are now the life-giving Spirit, and that You have been breathed into us, but, Lord, how can we make a living here on earth?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A second question we may have after reading chapter twenty concerns the carrying out of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be sure, God's purpose has not been fully carried out in chapter twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, the breathing of the Lord into His disciples was the beginning for them to carry out God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is indicated by the fact that before He breathed on them and told them to receive the Holy Spirit, He said to them, "As the Father has sent Me, I also send you" v. 21 . This word indicates the Lord's commission, for His sending was His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But how in a practical way should the disciples carry out the Lord's sending?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What should they do to fulfill His commission?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another question concerns the disciples' future.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How should they follow Him in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They had followed the Lord for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But after the Lord's death and resurrection, they could no longer follow Him in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord's resurrection was a new beginning with respect to their following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How, then, should the disciples follow Him after His resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have asked three questions: the first, concerning the practical living of the disciples; the second, concerning the way to carry out the Lord's commission; and the third, concerning the way to follow the Lord after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we did not have chapter twenty-one, we would find it difficult to answer these three practical questions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John 20:20 says, "The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the church meetings sometimes we are like the disciples in that we also are happy and joyful in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, after the meeting we may have certain questions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may wonder how to make a living in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps we will say to ourselves, "In the meeting we received a commission from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But what should we do to carry out this commission?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We were deeply touched by Him in the meeting, and we even received the holy breath through the Lord's breathing upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But how should we follow Him now?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What will be our future as followers of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we shall see, the answer to these questions is found in chapter twenty-one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this reason, John 21 is an intimate chapter, and we appreciate it very much.</S>
