   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH THE SOUL-LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now I want to point out another side of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we have been born of the Spirit, we still have the flesh with us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have the flesh without and the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To grow in life means to have the Spirit within you increasing all the time and the flesh without decreasing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Colossians 3 says that in the new man, the Body of Christ, the church, there is no natural person vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, there is no American, Chinese, Canadian, Japanese, Mexican or any other race in the new man, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All of us in our flesh are like ugly worms, but within us there is something beautiful, which is the spiritual, heavenly, divine "butterfly."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord came that we might have life for the purpose of producing the Body, and in the Body there is nothing old.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we are old in our natural man, so we need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why we need to drink the Lord, eat the Lord, abide in the Lord, and breathe in the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in order to be transformed, our soul-life must also be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our mind, emotion, and will our entire soul must be dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In John 6:44-45 the Lord said, "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up in the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is written in the prophets, 'And they shall all be taught of God.'</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Father draws us to His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, by enlightening our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The real meaning of repentance is to have a change in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even today we still need some change in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our mind can frustrate us from coming to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Day by day, morning and evening, we need a change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need the enlightenment of the Father so that we may realize our oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our mind needs to be taught by the Father afresh every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need the Father's teaching not man's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Father's teaching enlightens our mind that we may see the things in our concept and understanding that replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We might have something good in our mind which replaces Christ, so we need to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to have a change of mind, a change of our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Never be satisfied with what you understand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Never remain in your old concept.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John 5 the Lord told the Jewish people that they had the knowledge from the Old Testament, but they would not come to the Lord Jesus for life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to be enlightened and have our mind renewed again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In John 6 there is the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then in John 7 there is the dealing with the will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus said, "If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know..." v. 17 . This means that if we are going to know Christ and know the Father's intention, we must be submissive to take the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we will see that the Father's will is for us to enjoy His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may be exercising to drink the Lord, eat the Lord, abide in the Lord, and breathe in the Lord, but in many things we do not want to have a change of mind, and we do not want to have our will subdued to the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, we may have the feeding, the eating, but not the proper digestion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may exercise to enjoy the Lord, yet you are not willing to be enlightened in your mind and subdued in your will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, it is difficult for you to partake of the Lord in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Also, it is difficult for you to realize how much the Son of God means to you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The proper drinking and eating of the Lord must be realized in the change of the mind and in a submissive and subdued will.</S>
