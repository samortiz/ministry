   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY OF CHRIST, AS THE CHURCH OF GOD,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING AN ORGANISM LIKE THE HUMAN BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Body of Christ, as the church of God, is an organism like the human body Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The difference between an organism and an organization is life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A table is an organization with pieces of wood joined to other pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At first all the material for a table may be piled in one place without any organization.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when the craftsman puts the pieces together, he organizes them into a table.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A table is an organization, but a man is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As an organism, every man was conceived as a child in his mother's womb and remained there for nine months before being born out of that womb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The various parts of a child's body are not added to him along the way; they are already present and develop by the organic growth of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, a man is altogether an organism, not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Body of Christ is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, when believers, the constituents of the Body, do not live Christ, the church cannot be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today there are many different kinds of Christian groups, but among these groups we cannot see one organism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Strictly speaking, even among us it is difficult to see a proper organism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What I have seen is mostly organization.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today among Christians, organizations are mushrooming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seems that to begin a so-called church is easier than setting up a restaurant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are street churches, home churches, state churches all kinds of organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not the Body, because the Body is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As believers, we all have Christ in us, but we must live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we all live Christ, an organism is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The aggregate, the totality, of this kind of living of Christ is an organism, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Constituted with All the Living Members of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Body of Christ is not only built but is constituted with all the living members of Christ Rom 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Needing to Grow for Its Building Up</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not grow, there can be no building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The building of the Body of Christ depends absolutely on our growth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We grow in the growth of God within us Col 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When He grows in us, we grow in His growth, and this growth is the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today Christians easily come together, and they are also easily scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At first they are happy to come together, but after a while they begin to be unhappy with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, they separate from one another, and in some cases they become enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our eyes need to be opened and enlightened to the revelation in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, concerning the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to this revelation, the church as the Body of Christ is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, it must be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then it must grow, and by growing it builds itself up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The growth is organic, and the building is even more organic.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not organic in us, because we are not organic, but it is organic in God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Plants themselves are organic, but the soil in which they grow is not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even the nutrients of the soil are not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Being organic is a matter on the side of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church as the Body of Christ is organic on the life side, that is, on the side of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before we were regenerated, we did not have God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today, however, we have God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through regeneration God has been born into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, we not only have God added into us; we also have God born into us organically.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From the time of regeneration we have an organic union with Him.</S>
