<h2 class="head1">ARMED WITH THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>The church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must be full of life and strong in the truth. The church as the pillar is composed of all of us. Therefore, even the young sisters must know the truth. This is the reason that I encourage everyone, especially the young people, to get into the Word. All the divine facts are contained in the Word and conveyed to us through the Word. When the Spirit shines upon the Word, we have the heavenly television. The light shines upon the facts in the Word, and we know the truth. Then we should always be ready to rise up and practice the truth. From now on the whole church must be armed with the truth. If we are all under the heavenly television regarding matters such as the constitution of the church, the headship of Christ, and hierarchy, the church will be strong. It will be not only a house of life, but also a pillar of truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASE OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>In 1 Timothy 3:15 the Apostle Paul says that the church is not only the pillar of the truth, but also the base of the truth (Gk.). A pillar, which is a standing column, needs a solid base. The Greek word for &ldquo;base&rdquo; in this verse actually means a bulwark, a solid structure that upholds the pillar. As the pillar of the truth, the church must also have a solid base, a strong bulwark. A bulwark affords protection and defense, especially during a time of war. The church must be so solid in the truth that it will be a bulwark of the truth during times of fighting. This bulwark should be so solid that nothing, not even the &ldquo;bombs&rdquo; of the enemy, can shake it. The pillar rests upon such a bulwark. In order to be the pillar and base of the truth, we all must be solid, strong, clear, and rich in the truth. Every local church must be a solid bulwark and a high pillar. In every locality the pillar must be built up higher and higher to testify the truth to the whole universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRUTH BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Although the Apostle John was absolutely for life and the Spirit, in his last two Epistles he did not emphasize life and the Spirit; instead, he emphasized the truth. In 2 John 1 he speaks of loving in the truth and knowing the truth. In the next verse, he says, &ldquo;For the truth&rsquo;s sake, which abideth in us, and shall be with us forever&rdquo; (Gk.). If you compare these verses with John 14:16 and 17, you will see that truth is the Spirit. John 14:16 and 17 say that the Spirit of truth will be in us and that He will abide with us forever. Then 2 John 2 says that the truth abides in us and will be with us forever. Therefore, the truth is actually the Spirit. Hence, 1 John 5:6 says, &ldquo;the Spirit is the truth&rdquo; (Gk.).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT AND THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>We must have both the Spirit and the Bible. Without the Bible, the Spirit cannot be the truth. We need to get into the Word so that we may have not only the Spirit, but also the Spirit of truth. Eventually, this Spirit of truth is the truth itself.</p>
<p>In 3 John 4 the Apostle John says, &ldquo;I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth&rdquo; (Gk.). In Romans 8, however, Paul tells us to walk according to the Spirit. Actually walking in the truth and walking according to the Spirit are one. When we walk according to the Spirit, we are walking in the truth; and when we walk in the truth, we are walking according to the Spirit. Never try to separate the Spirit from the truth, for these two are one.</p>
<p>Remember, apart from the Bible, the Spirit can be only the Spirit. Only when the Spirit is one with the Bible is the Spirit the Spirit of truth. How we thank the Lord that in His economy He has given us both the Spirit and the Word! Together these two constitute the Spirit of truth that sets us free and sanctifies us.</p>
