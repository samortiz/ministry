   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Not Fainting Burning Dimly</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>nor Being Discouraged Bruised ,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>until He Has Established Justice in the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Himself does not faint burn dimly nor is He discouraged bruised , until He has established justice in the earth Isa 42:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Hebrew word for "faint" is the root of the word for "burn dimly."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That means He was a torch made of flax who did not burn dimly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To burn dimly is to faint.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ never fainted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He does not extinguish the dimly burning flax, but He Himself never burns dimly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be discouraged means to be bruised.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ was never discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He will never faint or be discouraged, until He finishes His commission to establish justice in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Justice here refers to salvation as the result of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our salvation, the salvation which we have received, is the result of God's judgment on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ as our substitute was judged by God according to His righteous law, completely fulfilling all the requirements of that law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The result was salvation to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To establish justice in the earth means to establish God's salvation, which is the issue of God's judgment on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His commission was to establish such a salvation in the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ will come again when He finishes the establishment of God's justice, God's salvation, in this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Justice is righteousness passing through judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A person may be righteous without justice being exercised with him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he is brought to the court, the judge makes a judgment that he is just.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, justice is the issue of righteousness through judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Recovery Version of Isaiah, 42:1 says that "He will bring forth judgment to the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 3 says that "He will bring forth judgment in truth," judgment in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 4 says, "Until He has established justice in the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Judgment and justice are the same Hebrew word in these three verses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Justice is righteousness under judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When righteousness has been judged, it becomes justice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Justice is the verdict of the judgment on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I may have righteousness, but if I have never been judged, I cannot have justice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After my righteousness has been judged, the result of that judgment is justice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The justice in Isaiah is equal to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To establish justice on this earth is to establish God's salvation in this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To bring forth justice is to bring forth God's salvation to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Justice is the salvation of God and the verdict of the judgment of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Righteousness is the fulfillment of God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have any item that does not fulfill the law, you are not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If your being and your behavior fulfill every part of the law, you are righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If this passes through judgment, your righteousness becomes your justice, and this justice is your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without such a justice, you will be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we can proclaim that on the whole earth there is justice!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This justice is the verdict of God's judgment over the righteous One, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The declaration of this justice is the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Salvation in God's gospel is very lawful and very just.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I did a lot of preaching fifty years ago in China.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Chinese are very logical.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some would ask me, "Do you mean that if I were a bank robber, I could be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If so, your God is not righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is quite logical.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How could a bank robber be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you said Confucius could be saved, that might be logical to these Chinese, but what about a bank robber?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I answered them in the following way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A bank robber should be sentenced to death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But this bank robber has a Savior, and the Savior died for him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This Savior not only died for him but also paid back all the things he had stolen from the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now the judge must forgive the robber.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Is this not righteous?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not just righteousness, but also justice declared by the verdict issued by the judge in the court.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>My explanation did much to convince these logical Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They were convinced that the God whom I preached is a righteous God, a just God, a God who carries out judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sinners have been redeemed by One who is qualified to die for them and to repay all their debts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Based upon Christ's death, God forgives all of us, the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is logical and just, and this forgiveness is a kind of justice.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If God would not forgive us now that our debt has been paid by Christ, there would be no justice.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may say that this justice is forgiveness and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now the salvation, or the gospel we preach, is this kind of justice that comes out of God's judgment over Christ's righteousness.</S>
