   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A DEPUTY AUTHORITY CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE A MISTAKE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Self-motivated service cannot find acceptance in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In fact, no one can render any service at all by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A man must serve by standing on the ground of resurrection before his service can be approved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord does not want us to be misguided to assume that authority comes from someone other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not the authority; we are only here to represent authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The flesh has no place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must also tell others that everything wrong comes from us and everything right comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every time we talk to men or deal with matters, we have to remember that we cannot trust in ourselves and that we have to understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot go out on our own and make suggestions or decisions lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Authority does not rest with us; we are merely the deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we act according to our own will, we will create big problems.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church cannot be without authority, and the church cannot tolerate the misuse of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has only one mind, which is to build up His own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the church submission to authority is absolute, and fear and trembling on the part of the deputy authority should also be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without submission there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the same time, a deputy authority must not make suggestions or decisions loosely, and he must not speak carelessly or dictate others' pathways.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is wrong to judge the brothers or to interpret the Bible lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our submission must be absolute, and our representation of authority must also be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are two problems in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One is the lack of absolute submission, and the other is the misrepresentation of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must learn not to speak loosely or make proposals casually.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our spirit has to be open to the Lord all the time, and we have to look to His light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not, we will implicate God in our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may even say that we are acting in the Lord's name or on His behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, none of our actions are of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must learn to submit on the one hand, and learn to represent God on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, we must know the cross, and we must know resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether or not the church will have a way to go on depends on how we have learned this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AUTHORITY BEING BASED ON MINISTRY, AND MINISTRY BEING BASED ON RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A man's authority is based on his ministry, and his ministry is based on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without resurrection there is no ministry, and without ministry there is no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without resurrection, Aaron could not serve.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His service was based on resurrection, and his authority before men was also based on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Resurrection enables us to serve before God and establishes us as an authority before men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God will never appoint a man who has no ministry to be His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Authority today is not a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without a spiritual service, there cannot be any positional authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only after a man has a spiritual service before the Lord can he have authority before men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that God will appoint you as an authority among His children only after you have acquired a spiritual ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, authority is based on one's ministry before God, and ministry is based on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason, there is no dispute in the matter of authority, for there is no dispute in the matter of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ministry is something given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, authority is also something decided by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a ministry has not been given to you, no authority has been assigned to you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All authority is based on service.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Without service there is no authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Aaron had authority because he had a service before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His censer could make propitiation and stop the plague, while the censers of the other 250 leaders were cursed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The rebellion in Numbers 16 was not only a rebellion against authority, but a rebellion against ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Aaron had a spiritual ministry because he was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was able to be the authority because he had such a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not have any authority that extends beyond our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No one can acquire an authority that goes beyond his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not boast of any authority that is apart from our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to learn to be faithful in our ministry before the Lord and faithful in our authority before men.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should have the attitude that we will not go about in things too great or too wondrous for us Psa 131:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to learn to be faithful to our portion before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many people make the mistake of thinking that anyone can assume authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Little do they realize that any authority which issues from a ministry never goes beyond its own service to rule over God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Your measure of authority before men must match your ministry before God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The amount of service you have before God determines the amount of authority you have before men.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As soon as authority goes beyond ministry, it becomes a positional authority, and it is no longer spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Authority issues from ministry, and when it flows to others, it brings the presence of God with it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Ministry grows out of resurrection and is rooted in God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a minister misrepresents authority, his ministry will stop, just as Moses' and Aaron's ministries were stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to learn to maintain the Lord's authority and not to say things loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Otherwise, we will suffer God's judgment.</S>
