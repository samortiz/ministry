   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE TENT OF MEETING AND ALL THE OFFERINGS Scripture Reading: Gen 1:1, 26-27; 50:26; Exo 1:1; 40:34, 38; Lev 1:1-17; 6:8-13; Heb 10:5-7; 9:14a; Phil 2:7-8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first important matter in regard to seeing Christ as the reality is to realize that Christ is the reality by which we worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the universe, the relationship between man and God is man's worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we work must all be for the worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So when we mention worship to God, it includes all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To take Christ as our reality means to take Christ as our being, our doing, our living, and even as our worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I believe that we know something of Christ as reality in a general way, but we are not so clear concerning Christ as reality in details.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This has been buried in the Bible for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although it is in the Bible, it has never been adequately discovered and unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But I believe that in these last days this very thing has been more and more opened up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It has been more than ever before discovered and unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So we need to spend some time to see Christ in the pages of the Old Testament as well as the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Testament is so simple and brief, while the Old Testament gives us a picture in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Just in the one book of Leviticus, we can see all the details of Christ as the reality to us by which we worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE SITUATION IN GENESIS AND EXODUS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the above verses, we have read both the first and last verses of Genesis and Exodus before coming to Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and of course, God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man was created by God to express God Himself and to represent God for His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man was the center of God's creation to express Him and to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But at the end of the book of Genesis, we see that the man created by God died and was put into a coffin in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How poor and pitiful!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If this were the end of the Scriptures, we all would be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But this is not the ultimate consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After Genesis, there is Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a way out, an exit praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the beginning of Exodus is not as glorious as the beginning of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the beginning of Genesis, God created the heavens, the earth, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But man fell, died, and was put into a coffin in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then Exodus begins with all of the children of Israel in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone, without exception, was in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How poor!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But how glorious when we reach the end of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead of a coffin, there is a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead of a dead corpse, there is the shekinah glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The coffin was individualistic, while the tabernacle is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever there are the words, "the tabernacle of the congregation" or "the tent of the congregation," we should read "the tent of meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I really like this term "meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not a tent of individuals, but a tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>GOD ON THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Exodus there was a tent of meeting for God's dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was no longer just in the heavens; He was also on the earth in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we come to the book of Leviticus, we find that God speaks out of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On Mount Sinai, God spoke from the heavens, but since God has a tent of meeting on the earth, He can speak out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Out of all the coffins, God raised up a people and brought them out of Egypt to build them together to become the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Where were we before we were saved?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We were just in a coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And we were not in a corporate coffin, but in so many separate and individualistic coffins in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the young brothers and sisters and all the older ones were in the same situation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We were all "in a coffin in Egypt."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But, hallelujah, the day came when the Lord called us out of the coffins and brought us out of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We had a real exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And now He has brought us together in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today we can all declare that there is a tent of meeting in Los Angeles!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no need for God to speak out of the heavens because He has a tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord is speaking today out of the local churches, and the local churches are the tents of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After God's creation and the fall of man, through His redemption, there is a tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is so marvelous to me!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am so excited because I see the tent of meeting!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should never be disappointed or defeated, because we have the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The tent of meeting is a glorious victory over all the deadening works of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God is so victorious and successful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should all be excited, and we should excite others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Just look at the people today in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everybody has such a sad face, and they are all so disappointed, but we are so happy and excited.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Praise the Lord, today in the city of Los Angeles, in the district of Hollywood, there is a tent of meeting!</S>
