   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AN ANSWER CONCERNING TAKING A JOB TO SERVE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Yu-xian:</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With regard to your question in your letter of April 24 see Issue No. 1 of this publication , the answer is as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A saved person should be a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, his service should be in coordination with the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he receives grace to serve in a way which occupies his time and strength, of course he cannot, and should not, take a job.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If he receives grace to serve, but all his time and energy are not completely consumed, he should use the rest of his time and energy to do a job.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But this job is just a second job; his true profession is serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A person should not idly wait on God and look for His arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He should always serve God in the church in the place where he is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If he has extra time and energy, he should take a job.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May you have peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>August 16, 1948</S>
