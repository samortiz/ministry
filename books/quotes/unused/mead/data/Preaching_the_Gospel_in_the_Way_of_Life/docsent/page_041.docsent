   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOSPEL BEING A LIFELONG MATTER OF LIVING AND LABORING IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Learn to fellowship with the Lord and to live in, by, and with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Learn to walk in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then in this way, if we have the desire to cooperate with the Lord, He will open the way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He will pave the way for us to contact our neighbors, schoolmates, classmates, and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is by this that we will bring people to the Lord; it is by this that we will bear the real fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I say again, this is not a work, a movement, or an activity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a Christian living, and since it is a living, it must be normal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A living is not miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must have a living in a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times the Lord did some genuine miracles in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have no doubt about this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I saw this kind of thing, but it did not happen most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most of the time the gospel is normal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We live for Christ, and we walk with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We come together, we pray, and we declare and proclaim the Lord's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then the Lord will pave the way and open the door for us to bring people in.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a lifelong matter, a matter for the long run.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must change our idea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot have these things as something in a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Matthew 28:19 the Lord spoke concerning the preaching of the gospel, saying, "Disciple all the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition, the apostle Paul said that when he preached the gospel, he travailed Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To travail is to bring forth, to deliver, a child.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All mothers know how much they are spent in travail for their children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to spend, and we have to be spent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not only preaching the gospel; we are living here for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is our life, and this is our living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to have long-lived preaching, we have to make this matter normal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Anything that is normal has a long life, but nothing miraculous can have long life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can never live in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to live by the normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I do not oppose the miraculous way, but that is neither in my hand nor in your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That is in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our duty and our responsibility must be normal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are here for the preaching of the gospel, so we must have a living for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE GOSPEL REQUIRING A PRACTICAL, REAL TESTIMONY IN OUR DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This requires us to be overcomers; it requires a real overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our life must be victorious and overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is especially true in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not a heathen country.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although there is a good number of unsaved ones, nearly all the people have heard something about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, in this country there is an even greater need for a testimony in our daily walk, a testimony in the way we live.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must have a practical, real testimony in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If someone is a teacher, he must be different from the other teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the office as a co-worker or employee, we have to be different, not in the negative sense but in a very positive sense.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In addition, we have to spend something, and we have to be spent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We cannot do the work of preaching in a light way or in the way of a dream that we will receive special power in order to bring in many people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to history, a greater percentage of people has been saved through a proper testimony than through the so-called miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I was not brought to the Lord in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I did see a great number of people brought to the Lord through the miraculous way, but regrettably not many of them still stand fast.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is mostly those who are brought to the Lord through the testimony in the lives of the believers that stand steadfast and grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From my whole Christian life I cannot point out many persons who were saved through miracles that could stand fast and grow adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are some, but very few.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, I can point out many others who stand fast in the Lord and grow adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Through what means were they saved?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was through a life testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must all realize that the preaching of the gospel must be a part of our life.</S>
