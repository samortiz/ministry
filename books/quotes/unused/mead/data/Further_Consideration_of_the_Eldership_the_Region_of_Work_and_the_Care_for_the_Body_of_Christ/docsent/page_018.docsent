   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I must testify in honesty that I have been commissioned by the Lord to carry His truth and bring His recovery to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The recovery is based upon the truth that Christ has only one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even if these divisive ones move to a city in which there is not a church, they have to be checked concerning what kind of relationship they have with the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One of the tests of a genuine local church is that it should have universal fellowship with all the other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When these dissenting ones came to me, I told them that regardless of what they did, I would not make any division or set up new churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But I also told them that I would not tolerate anything that was against the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Later, they began to say that once an apostle establishes churches and appoints elders in them, he should keep his hands off of these churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I pointed out that Paul did not keep his hands off of the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He established the church in Ephesus, appointed elders there, and went back to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He stayed there at one time for three and a half years Acts 20:17, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he could not go to them personally, he wrote to them Eph 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How could the apostles be commissioned only to set up the churches without building them up?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is altogether illogical and unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I shared this, they had no ground to teach concerning the so-called autonomy of a local church as put forth by G.H. Lang in his book The Churches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is not an organization that can practice autonomy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even the United States, a nation of organization, cannot have absolute autonomy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this country, the states do not have an autonomous defense, diplomacy, or postal system.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The postal system, the diplomacy, and the defense of the country are national matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even in a nation like the United States, absolute autonomy cannot be practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The ones in this recent rebellion taught this because they wanted me to stay away from the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their teaching issued in division.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later, one of them said that there was not only one apostle but also a number of apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said that he could present a list of the brothers among us who were apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Another brother asked him for this list.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of the ones on this list had been my students.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After this I went to Taiwan and gave a message on the different kinds of apostles see chapter two of A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need pp.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>21-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of what I presented, they changed and said that there were only twelve apostles eleven plus Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They said that the one selected in Acts 1, Matthias, was a wrong one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was the old teaching of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We knew this and rejected it many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Nee rejected this wrong teaching in The Normal Christian Church Life see chapter one pp.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>20-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When they got to know this, they eventually said that there were no apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I said in the past that all the saints could function as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows that the ones involved in this recent rebellion do not care for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They do not care for the oneness, for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not do anything without taking care of the Body.</S>
