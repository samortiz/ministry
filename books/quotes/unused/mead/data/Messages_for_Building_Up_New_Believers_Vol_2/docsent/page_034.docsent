   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Telling Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 16 says, But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you go to him by yourself and speak to him with a proper motive, a good attitude, and gentle words, and he still does not hear you, then go and tell others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, you must tell someone else only after he has rejected your words.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You must not tell others loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a problem arises between two of God s children and if both of them go to the Lord and deal with it, everything will be solved easily.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But suppose one is not careful with his words and the problem spreads to the ear of a third person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The problem will be compounded, and it will be hard to solve.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there is no contamination of a wound, the healing process is relatively simple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If dirt gets into a wound, not only does the level of pain increase, but the dirt makes it harder for the wound to heal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Unnecessarily spreading a problem to a third person is like adding dirt to a wound.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Any problems between the brothers and sisters should be dealt with directly by the involved persons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only time we should tell another person or persons is when one party will not receive the admonition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The purpose of telling others is not to multiply the gossip but to invite others to exhort, help, and fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The one or two more here should be experienced persons in the Lord; they should be those who are weighty in their spiritual measure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You should present the case before them and ask for their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They should check whether the fault lies with the offending one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The mature ones should pray and consider the matter before the Lord and then arbitrate according to their spiritual discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If they feel that the fault lies with the offending brother, they should go to that brother and say, You are wrong in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By doing this you have cut yourself off from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must repent and confess.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The one or two more must not have a loose tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not invite talkative persons to such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Talkative ones can never convince people; instead, invite those who are trustworthy, honest, spiritual, and experienced before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way every word will be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>E. Finally Telling the Church</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 17 says, If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we cannot deal with the problem by ourselves, we should bring one or two with us to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the other person still refuses to hear them, we have to tell it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Telling the church does not mean that we publicize the matter when the whole church is gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It means telling the responsible elders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the conscience of the church also feels that this brother is wrong, he must be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the offending brother is one who walks before God, he should lay aside his own view and accept the witness of two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If he does not accept the witness of two or three, he should at least accept the verdict of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The unanimous view and judgment of the church reflect the heart of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The brother should realize that it is wrong to ignore the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He should be meek and not trust in his own feelings or his own judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, he should accept the feeling of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What if he still refuses to hear?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 17 continues, If he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a serious word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In other words, if he refuses to hear the church, all the brothers and sisters in the church should no longer communicate with him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since he does not want to face his problem, the church should consider him as a Gentile and a tax collector and should have no fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Though he is not excommunicated, all the brothers should consider him as a Gentile and tax collector, and no one should pay any attention to him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If he speaks, no one should listen.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If he comes to break bread, everyone should ignore him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If he prays, no one should say amen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If he wants to come, he can come.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If he wants to go, he can go.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But everyone should consider him as an outsider.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If God s children will hold such an attitude in one accord, it will be easy to restore a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The purpose for dealing with him in this way is still to restore him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 18, which says, Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven, is related to the previous verses.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord in heaven acknowledges what the church does on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the church considers a person who refuses to hear the church as being wrong, the church will look upon him as a Gentile and a tax collector, and our Lord in heaven will acknowledge the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verses 19 and 20 are also based on the preceding portion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why does the previous verse say that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established ?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here we see that the principle of two or three is the principle of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If two or three act upon a matter in one accord, and if these two or three deliberate something before God in one accord, God will acknowledge the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Matthew 18:18-20 is spoken in the context of our dealing with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When a matter is brought up to two or three people and then to the whole church, the Father in heaven will acknowledge such a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Here we want to mention something in passing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How does the church make important decisions?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Acts 15 shows us that when brothers come together, everyone can speak and debate.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even those who are for the law can stand up and speak their mind, even though their opinion is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In other words, all the brothers have equal opportunity to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But not all the brothers can arbitrate matters.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All the brothers can express how they feel before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After the elders have listened to all of them, they should speak their feelings before God and make a final judgment on the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The responsible brothers may have the same feeling before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This feeling is the feeling of the church; it is also the conscience of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After they have spoken, everyone should submit and go along with them in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The church does not muzzle people s mouths or forbid anyone to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But no one should speak carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the time comes for a decision, the elders should speak under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and all the brothers and sisters should listen to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the Holy Spirit s authority is present in the church, such matters can be resolved easily.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If the Holy Spirit has no authority in the church and there are many opinions of the flesh, the church will not be able to arbitrate anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must learn to submit to the authority of the Holy Spirit and to listen to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>May God be gracious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May we be like our Master who is so full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If a brother offends us, we should forgive him from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Moreover, we should bear the responsibility of restoring him according to the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>May the Lord lead us to live such a life in the church.</S>
