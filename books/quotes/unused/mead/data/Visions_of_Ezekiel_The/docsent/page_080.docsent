   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Enjoying the Riches of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Finally, all the priests enjoyed the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the heave offerings, all the firstfruits, all the top produce of the people of the Lord belonged to the priests 44:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All of the riches of Christ were for their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have God as their possession, and they have Christ in all His rich aspects as their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The responsibility of the priest was to present the offerings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The record in Ezekiel may seem to be peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moses told the people of the Lord to offer one lamb out of ten to God, but Ezekiel told them to offer one out of two hundred 45:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that if you do not produce a large quantity of the enjoyment of Christ, you are not qualified to offer anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Though you may produce 199 lambs, you are still not qualified to make an offering to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you desire to offer one lamb, you must first raise up two hundred lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Your richness in the experience of Christ qualifies your offering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Moses' law, if you have ten lambs, you are qualified to offer one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But according to Ezekiel you must have twenty times more.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must have two hundred lambs in order to be qualified to offer one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am afraid that none of us can come up to the standard in Ezekiel concerning the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The principle is the same with the wheat and the barley.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ezekiel 45:13 says, "This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of barley."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One homer is equal to ten ephahs and the offering must be one sixth of an ephah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that you have to offer one part out of sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moses' requirement was one out of ten, but Ezekiel's requirement was one out of sixty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even if you have four ephahs of wheat, you are not qualified to offer anything: you must have at least a homer of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once you have a homer of wheat, then you can offer one-sixtieth to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You must be rich in wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moses' requirement did not force you to be so rich, but Ezekiel's requirement forces you to be very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The offering of oil also required an abundant supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ezekiel 45:14 says, "Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is a homer of ten baths; for ten baths are a homer."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One homer is equal to ten baths and you must offer one tenth of a bath of a homer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means you offer only one percent, one out of a hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must be rich in the produce of Christ in order to offer an offering of oil to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are not rich, you are not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of the wheat and barley, you must offer one-sixtieth; of the oil, you must offer one-hundredth; and of the lambs you must offer one two-hundredth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ezekiel only mentions three categories for the heave offering: the barley and wheat, the oil, and the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The heave offering was heaved up into the air and signified the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the highest Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our service to God we need to heave Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to offer the ascended Christ, the highest Christ, to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Moses' law, there were many kinds of heave offerings, but in Ezekiel's writing there were only these three categories: the wheat and barley, the oil, and the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the book, The All-Inclusive Christ, we pointed out that wheat signifies the incarnated Christ who died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From the time of His incarnation to the time of His crucifixion, He was the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Barley signifies Christ in resurrection, because in Palestine barley is the first grain to be harvested.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, barley signifies the firstfruit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus fed the five thousand with loaves made of barley John 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The wheat and the barley signify Christ from the time of His incarnation all the way to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The oil, of course, signifies the Holy Spirit, and the lamb signifies the redeeming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These are the main aspects of the heave offering which we need to offer in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All these are related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the lamb.</S>
