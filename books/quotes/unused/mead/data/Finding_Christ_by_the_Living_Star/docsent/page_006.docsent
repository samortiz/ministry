   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AFTER THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And when you come and see, do not see Him after the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Jesus came into His own country, the people said, "Is not this the carpenter's son?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is not His mother called Mary?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And His brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And His sisters, are they not all with us?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matt 13:55-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They knew everything, but this was the knowledge of Jesus according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Matthew 22:43 we read that David in spirit called Him Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not follow those people in the flesh, but follow David in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now let us apply this practically to the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you would come to see the local church for example, the church in Los Angeles that is good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But do not see it after the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you see it according to the flesh, you will say that there are many peculiar people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not know any man after the flesh, but after the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once we knew Christ after the flesh and considered Him the little man of Nazareth, but now we know Him no longer in this way 2 Cor 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know Him after the spirit; in spirit we call Him "Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Forget about the outward things, forget about the flesh; try to see the church not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you beheld the tabernacle in the Old Testament outwardly, you could only see the outer badger skins Exo 36:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no beauty with the badger skin; it is quite mean and common.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But what was within the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Oh, there was the gold, the silver, the precious stones the beauty of precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Would you rather see the church outwardly or inwardly?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Outwardly speaking, the church is clothed with badger skin there is no beauty, just the toughness and even the wildness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But, hallelujah, within there is something of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Within, there is Jesus; within, we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can we find Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yes, we need the Bible, but we must see the living star.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE STAR THROUGH THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This matter of the star is not just in the Book of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the main things of the Bible, as a rule, begin in the Old Testament and go right through the New Testament to the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With this matter of the star there is no exception.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is mentioned and revealed first in Numbers 24:17, "There shall come a star out of Jacob."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the context of that verse, this star that comes out of Jacob is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ comes as the star.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then immediately in the very opening of the New Testament, we have the star again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The wise men said: "We have seen His star in the east" Matt 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They did not say, "We have seen a star," or "We have seen the star," but, "We have seen His star."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No doubt this is the fulfillment of the prophecy in Numbers 24.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The star prophesied in the Old Testament now has come and was shown to these wise men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have seen clearly that the revealing of this star was absolutely outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord God never cares for religion; anything that becomes religious, He will pass by.</S>
