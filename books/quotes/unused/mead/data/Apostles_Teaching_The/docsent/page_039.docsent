   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is strongly proven by Revelation 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this verse the Lord says, To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The paradise of God here refers to the New Jerusalem in the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, Revelation 3:12 indicates that the New Jerusalem will be a prize to the overcomers in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom will be a prize only to the overcoming saints, whereas the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion to all the redeemed saints for eternity.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They all will be the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The bride in the new heaven and the new earth will not be as she was in Revelation 19.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She was then composed of the overcomers only.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the bride in Revelation 21 will be enlarged to include all of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This bride will be the wife of the Lamb for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must remember that the New Jerusalem is not a literal, physical city.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AND THE LAMB THEMSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>FOR GOD S REDEEMED</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>TO WORSHIP HIM WITHIN IT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This New Jerusalem will be the eternal temple the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb Themselves for God s redeemed to worship Him within it Rev 21:22 .</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a common portion to all God s chosen and redeemed people in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is proven by verses 12-14 in Revelation 21, which say that the New Jerusalem bears the names of the twelve tribes and the names of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The twelve tribes represent the Old Testament saints, and the twelve apostles represent the New Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This presents a clear view that the entire New Jerusalem is a total composition of the Old Testament saints under God s first covenant and all the New Testament saints under God s second covenant, the new covenant.</S>
