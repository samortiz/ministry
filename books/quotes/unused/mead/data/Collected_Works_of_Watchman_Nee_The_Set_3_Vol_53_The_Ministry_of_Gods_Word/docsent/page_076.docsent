   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This is analogous to the principle of quoting Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suppose we have to quote the Scripture today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First we have to touch something in our experience, and then five, ten, or more verses will come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we must cultivate these verses in our spirit; we cannot cultivate them in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The same is true in our conversation with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Words which are relevant to the subject should be cultivated in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can only minister to others what we have cultivated in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have something but do not cultivate it to keep it alive, it does not do us any good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even our own experiences from five years ago have to be kept and cultivated in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If they are kept in the spirit, our spirit can use them when we talk with others about them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The same can be said of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If our spirit cannot use it, it cannot become part of our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our word must be formed by God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words we speak must be God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These words must not be a product of our thoughts or something we have picked up from others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They must be something that God has created and formed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has to try a man with fire for years before a few words can be wrought into him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are produced through prolonged years of carving and molding.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must realize that such words are the words of the constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Holy Spirit has to work on us for a long time before these words can be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These words are a kind of trust or earnest from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we experience something from the Lord and we are led through such an experience, some words are formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These words are truly our own, yet at the same time, they are truly God's. It is by this process that our words become God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One can only speak such words if he has walked through the depths of the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such words have been washed and tried by God; as such, they are God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be clear that the source of our speaking is the discipline we have received from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our speaking is based on the light we have in ourselves, and the light of the word we have received is based on the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even our reference to others' experience is based on the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to learn our lesson in the depths of the valley before we can announce it on the heights.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must see something in our spirit before it can become light to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every word that we speak has to be pressed out, squeezed out, and harnessed from the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever kind of person we are, whatever kind of trials we suffer, and whatever lessons we have learned will be reflected in the kind of words we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word is produced through trials, pain, defeat, and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No minister of God's word should be afraid when God leads him into such circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once we know this way, we will praise Him, saying, "Lord, You are about to give me some more words."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first few times we may act foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may wonder what is happening to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But after a while we should no longer be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should realize that some words are produced the first time we go through a trial.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>More words are produced the second time a trial comes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After we go through such experiences again and again, the words become more abundant and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then, whenever we face a trial, a suffering, a failure, or a weakness, we will have a clear voice within, saying, "Lord, You are giving me more words again."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will become wise in the acquisition of words.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the church of God, a minister of the word should take the lead in suffering, not merely in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we cannot walk ahead of the church in the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we have no word to minister to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a very serious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must be ahead of the church in the matter of trials before we can have something to minister to it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Otherwise, we can do nothing, and all of our ministry of the word is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We cheat ourselves as well as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The hymn "Let Us Contemplate the Grape Vine" Hymns, #635 climbs higher and higher with each stanza.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the end it shows us that the more we sacrifice, the more we can give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are not a sacrificing one, we have nothing to give to others, and we cannot be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The ministry of the word is a speaking that issues from one's depth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the source of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without this, there is no speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Finally, we have to remember the basic principle which Paul put forth in 2 Corinthians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He said, "For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The phrase response of death can also be translated as the judgment of death.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is this judgment of death?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul goes on to say that God had a purpose in all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was to teach him not to have confidence in himself but to have his confidence in God who raises the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This was his comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When other brothers and sisters went through the same trial, he was able to comfort them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>"For even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our comfort also abounds.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comforting and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comforting, which operates in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And our hope for you is firm, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you are of the comfort" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the basic principle underlying the ministry of the word: taking the lead to suffer in all kinds of trials and then ministering to others what has been learned.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are first comforted, and then we comfort others with the comfort with which we ourselves have been comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is a very basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For this reason, we should never use shallow words in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, we should speak what we have learned through our repeated trials.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many expressions, words, and illustrations cannot be used, because our speaking becomes shallow as soon as we use them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>During ordinary times we have to learn to speak accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord has to discipline us until our words echo the words of the Bible more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should learn to use the terms and the expressions found in God's Word more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The words of the ministry are words that issue from within through discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The source of the word is the discipline we have received; the word is acquired through discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>For this reason, we must never despise the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If a word does not have its origin in the discipline of the Holy Spirit, it is a vain word, and the church does not receive any benefit from it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brothers, do not regard the discipline of the Lord lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must learn our lessons by passing through the fire.</S>
