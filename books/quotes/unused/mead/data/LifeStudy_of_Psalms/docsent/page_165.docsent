   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>An example of a biblical symbol or photograph is the tree of life in Genesis 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible the tree of life is not actually a literal tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, the tree of life is a symbol of God as the source and reality of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that the tree of life is a symbol of God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Other symbols in the Old Testament are types of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first of these types is Eve, the wife of Adam Gen 2:18-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From Ephesians 5 we know that the relationship between husband and wife portrays the great mystery Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the picture of Eve as the counterpart, increase, and enlargement of Adam, we would not realize that the church is the counterpart, increase, and enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, we need the type of Eve to symbolize what the church is to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Old Testament also uses the tabernacle and the temple as symbols to unveil another aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eve, the tabernacle, and the temple are all photographs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is not only Christ's counterpart, symbolized by Eve, but also God's house, God's dwelling place, symbolized first by the tabernacle and then by the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we did not have these two symbols, we would not understand many of the details concerning the church being God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From this we see that the biblical way is to use symbols to portray spiritual things, and we need to keep this in mind as we come to Psalm 45.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Psalm 45 was written in praise of King Solomon, who was a symbol, a type, of Christ with a wife composed of many "daughters," of many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God had no need of a king to symbolize Christ in this way, Solomon would not have been created.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible clearly reveals that God's intention is that a man have only one wife, yet Solomon had hundreds of wives 1 Kings 11:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As far as Psalm 45 is concerned, we should understand this not ethically but typically.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ethically, Solomon should not have had many wives.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Typically speaking, however, there was the need for a man with hundreds of wives so that God would have a particular type of the church composed of many believers from many nations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Solomon with his wives is a type of Christ with His corporate wife, a wife composed of believers from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation Rev 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Solomon did not follow God's regulation about having only one wife, and many readers of the Bible would condemn him for this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, in Psalm 45, written in praise of Solomon, Solomon is a type of Christ as the One with a corporate wife.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would understand this, we need a mind that is renewed and enlightened with spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the reason I have pointed out that we should not come to this psalm with our natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The natural mind is of no avail in understanding Psalm 45.</S>
