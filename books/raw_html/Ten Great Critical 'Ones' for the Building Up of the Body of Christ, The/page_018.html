<h1 class=series>THE TEN GREAT CRITICAL “ONES” FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIX</h1><h1 class=title>ONE TESTIMONY—ONE EXPRESSION, ONE BODY—ONE ORGANISM, AND ONE CITY—ONE CONSUMMATION</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>One testimony—one expression:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Christ is the faithful Witness of God testifying in His human living what God is—Rev. 1:5; 3:14.</li>	<li>The believers are the witnesses of Christ for the spreading of His gospel—Acts 1:8:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Testifying the human living of Christ—Acts 10:37-39a.</li>		<li>Testifying His death, resurrection, and ascension—Acts 2:30-36; 3:15; 10:39b-41.</li>		<li>To save sinners to be the members of Christ for the building up of His Body—Acts 2:37-42; 4:10-12; 10:42-43.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The local churches, composed with the believers to be the Body of Christ, are the golden lampstands—Rev. 1:11-12.</li>	<li>All the golden lampstands are identical in nature, shape, and function to be the one expression of Christ:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In the unique oneness of the Spirit of the unique Body of Christ (Eph. 4:3-4).</li>		<li>In the unique fellowship of the unique Spirit, participating in the unique flow of the Triune God (1 John 1:3; 2 Cor. 13:14).</li>		<li>In the unique move of the unique God for the unique accomplishment of His unique economy (Eph. 1:10; 1 Tim. 1:4b).</li>		<li>In the unique blending in the unique life of Christ for His unique testimony in the universe (1 Cor. 12:24).</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>One Body—one organism:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God in His move.</li>	<li>The constitution of the divinity of the processed and consummated Triune God with the humanity of all His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people—Eph. 4:4-6.</li>	<li>The accomplishment of God’s economy according to the good pleasure, the heart’s desire, of His will—Eph. 1:5.</li>	<li>Built with Christ’s life as its element, the Spirit of reality as its essence, and the person of God as its source—Eph. 4:4-6.</li>	<li>Built up by the perfected saints who are perfected by the gifted members—Eph. 4:11-12.</li>	<li>Built up with the mature believers as its constituents through their growth in the life of Christ unto maturity—Eph. 4:15-16.</li>	<li>Built by itself in love—Eph. 4:16:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Joined together through every joint of the rich supply (the particular gifted members).</li>		<li>Knit together through the operation in measure of each one part (all the saints).</li>		</ol></li>	<li>It will consummate in the New Jerusalem—Rev. 21—22.</li>	</ol></li><li>One city—one consummation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The title the holy city, New Jerusalem implies that it is not only holy but also new—Rev. 21:2:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>It is holy because it is separated and sanctified unto God as something belonging to God according to His holy nature.</li>		<li>It is new because it, as the main part of God’s new creation, has God’s nature of newness—2 Cor. 5:17.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The holy city New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the work for God’s new creation out of God’s old creation through all the four ages of man’s history (the age before the law, the age of law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom), from God’s making the spirit for man and putting man in front of the tree of life to the accomplishment of this city for the good pleasure of His will, which is the intent of His eternal economy.</li>	<li>It is the unique constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people chosen by Him in eternity past.</li>	<li>In its humanity it is the tabernacle of God (the dwelling place of God among men who is the unique King reigning over the entire new heaven and new earth), and in its divinity it is the temple of God (the dwelling place of God’s redeemed people serving Him as a royal priestly family who are the kings reigning over the nations around the New Jerusalem in eternity)—Rev. 21:3, 22.</li>	<li>The materials of its structure:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Its base is gold, signifying the nature of God—Rev. 21:18b.</li>		<li>Its gates are pearls, signifying the issue of Christ’s redeeming death and life-dispensing resurrection—21:21a.</li>		<li>Its wall with its foundations is precious stones, signifying the product of the transforming Spirit—21:18a, 19-20.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Its street upon its golden base joining to its throne is gold, signifying God’s nature, and is uniquely one, spiraling from the top of its base to reach all its twelve gates—21:21b.</li>	<li>Its glory is the most excellent glory of God shining in Christ throughout the entire city—21:11.</li>	<li>Its light is God shining in Christ the Lamb as the lamp—21:23.</li>	<li>Its throne is the throne of the Lamb-God upon its golden base joining with its golden street as its center for its government—22:1b.</li>	<li>Its supply is:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The tree of life, signifying the all-inclusive Christ of life, growing on the two banks of the river of the water of life—22:2.</li>		<li>The river of the water of life, signifying the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit, flowing from the throne of the Lamb-God—22:1a.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>It is the wife, the counterpart, of Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God—21:9b, 2.</li>	<li>Every part of this unique city expresses the unique oneness of the Body of Christ. Today our work for the Lord with its issue should be governed and directed by this pattern. What is unveiled in the vision of this unique city should be the model of what we are and how we work.</li>	<li>The restored but not saved nations, the sheep, come from the judgment of Christ on His throne of glory, justified and sent by Him (Matt. 25:31-46) to be the people who are the subjects of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</li>	</ol></li><p>A Concluding Note<br><p>All of us, the co-workers and the elders, need to see the vision of these ten great critical “ones.” Every “one” should be a strong principle that directs, corrects, adjusts, and regulates us for the performing of the proper oneness of the Body of Christ today and the keeping of us on the right track of the Lord’s work, so that we will not be ashamed at the judgment seat of our Lord but rather be rewarded by Him for the participation in His kingship and priesthood in the kingdom.</p></ol>
