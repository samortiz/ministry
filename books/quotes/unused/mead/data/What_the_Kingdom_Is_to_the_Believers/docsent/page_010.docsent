   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE WHAT THE KINGDOM IS TO THE BELIEVERS 3 GOD S KINGDOM, RULING, AND GLORY Scripture Reading: Luke 19:11-13, 15; Psa 2:6-7; Dan 7:13-14; Acts 2:33, 36; John 16:13-15; Rev 22:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The kingdom is a crucial truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we truly know the Bible, we will realize that the entire story of God in the universe is a story of ruling, that is, a story of obtaining a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is easy to see that for a great person to fulfill his desire and manifest his glory, he must possess authority and acquire a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he cannot acquire a kingdom and exercise his authority in it, he will have no way to carry out his plans and show forth his glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever the kingdom is mentioned in the Bible, it is usually associated with authority and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consider, for example, the Lord s prayer in Matthew 6.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the end of this prayer three items are mentioned together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord prayed, Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory v. 13 . Daniel 7:14 also puts these three items together, saying that the Son of Man was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom from God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without a kingdom, God has no way to exercise His authority; without the exercise of His authority, God has no way to fulfill His desire; and without the fulfillment of His desire, God has no way to express His honor and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verses 9 and 10 of His prayer in Matthew 6, the Lord mentioned three things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, the Lord prayed, Your name be sanctified v. 9 . This is a matter of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For God s name to be sanctified on earth is a matter of God s being glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord continued, Your kingdom come v. 10a , and then went on to pray, Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth v. 10b . This shows that the carrying out of God s will is a matter of the exercise of His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the sovereignty of a nation cannot be exercised in a certain place, the laws of that nation cannot be executed there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to execute a law and accomplish a purpose, a nation must be able to exercise its sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Laws are related to the will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to carry out His will on earth, God must extend His authority to the earth, and in order to extend His authority to the earth, He must obtain a kingdom on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once He acquires a kingdom, He will be able to exercise His authority, carry out His will, cause His name to be sanctified, and receive glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we see that these great matters the will of God, the glory of God, and the sanctification of God s name depend on God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once God has His kingdom, His will will be done, His name will be sanctified, and He will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The key to these matters is whether or not God can obtain His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The foundation of God s kingdom is the throne of God s rule.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SATAN AND MAN HAVING REBELLED</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AGAINST GOD S AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible clearly shows that the only thing Satan wants to do in the universe is to overthrow God s throne.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 14 reveals that Satan wanted to exalt his throne to be equal with God v. 13 . This means that Satan intends to violate God s sovereignty, usurp God s authority, and overthrow God s throne; he intends to establish his own kingdom in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 12 the Lord Jesus spoke of two kingdoms, the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said, If I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you v. 28 . He also said, If Satan casts out Satan...how then will his kingdom stand? v. 26 . This shows that there are two kingdoms in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One is God s kingdom, and the other is Satan s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One is God s exercise of His authority, and the other is Satan s usurpation of God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One is God s establishing of His throne for the exercise of His authority, and the other is Satan s overthrowing of God s throne for the setting up of his own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The matter of authority is mentioned in the very beginning of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Genesis 1 shows that God gave man the authority to have dominion over all the living things in the sea, in the air, and on the earth v. 26 . The way Satan stole man away from God was to seduce man to rebel against God, to usurp God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When man sinned, he did not merely violate a rule; even more, he revolted against God, rebelled against God, and put God s authority aside, denying God s authority and rejecting God s rule.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as Satan rebelled against God, man also rebelled against God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first creatures God created were the angels, among whom the archangel led many to rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later, God created man, who also rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One can say that man and Satan acted as a team to rebel against God.</S>
