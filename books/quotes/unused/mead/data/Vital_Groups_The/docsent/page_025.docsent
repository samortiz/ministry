   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All these divine and mystical teachings of our great Shepherd and Comforter are not only His unveiling and enlightening but also His nourishing to us for our growth and maturity in His divine life that the eternal economy of God may be consummated through us.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must be shepherds with the loving and forgiving heart of our Father God in His divinity and the shepherding and finding spirit of our Savior Christ in His humanity.</S>
