   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNCHANGEABLE PURPOSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God wanted to have man to rule for Him on this earth, but man did not attain to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Genesis 3 the fall took place and sin entered; man came under the power of Satan, and everything seemed to come to an end. Satan was seemingly victorious and God was seemingly defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition to the passage in Genesis 1, there are two more passages in the Scriptures which are related to this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are Psalm 8 and Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 8</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Psalm 8 shows that God's purpose and plan have never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the fall, God's will and requirement for man remained the same without any alteration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His will in Genesis 1, when He created man, still holds good, even though man has sinned and fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though Psalm 8 was written after man's fall, the psalmist was able to praise; his eyes were still set upon Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Holy Spirit did not forget Genesis 1, the Son did not forget Genesis 1, nor did God Himself forget Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us see the content of this psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 1 says, "O Jehovah our Lord,/How excellent is Your name/In all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All who are inspired by the Holy Spirit will utter such words: "How excellent is Your name in all the earth!"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Though some people slander and reject the Lord's name, yet the psalmist loudly proclaimed, "O Jehovah our Lord,/How excellent is Your name/In all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not say, "Your name is very excellent."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Very excellent" does not have the same meaning as "how excellent."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Very excellent" means that I, the psalmist, can still describe the excellence, whereas "how excellent" means that even though I can write psalms, I do not have the words to express, nor do I know how excellent is the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So I can only say, "O Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only is His name excellent, His name is excellent "in all the earth"!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The expression "in all the earth" is the same as in Genesis 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we know God's plan, every time we read the word "man" or the word "earth" our hearts should leap within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 2 continues, "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings/You have established strength/Because of Your adversaries,/To stop the enemy and the avenger."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Babes and sucklings refer to man, and the emphasis in this verse is upon God using man to deal with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus quoted this verse in Matthew 21:16: "Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These words mean that the enemy may do all he can, but it is not necessary for God Himself to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God will use babes and sucklings to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What can babes and sucklings do?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It says, "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings/You have established strength."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's desire is to obtain men who are able to praise; those who can praise are those who can deal with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verses 3 through 8 the psalmist says, "When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers,/The moon and the stars, which You have ordained,/What is man, that You remember him,/And the son of man, that You visit him?/You have made him somewhat lower than angels/And have crowned him with glory and honor./For You have caused him to rule over the works of Your hands;/You have put all things under his feet: /All sheep and oxen,/As well as the beasts of the field,/The birds of heaven and the fish of the sea,/Whatever passes through the paths of the seas."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we were writing this psalm, perhaps we would add a parentheses at this point: "How pitiful that man has fallen and sinned and been cast out of the garden of Eden!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No more can man attain to this."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But thank God, in the heart of the psalmist there was not such a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In God's view the earth can still be restored, the position given to man by God still exists, and His commitment to man to destroy the work of the devil still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, starting from the third verse, the psalmist again narrates the same old story, completely ignoring the third chapter of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the outstanding feature of Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's purpose is for man to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is man worthy?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But since God's purpose is for man to rule, man will surely rule.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 9 the psalmist again says, "O Jehovah our Lord, /How excellent is Your name/In all the earth!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He continues to praise, as though he were not even aware of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Though Adam had sinned and Eve had also sinned, they could never withstand God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man can fall and man can sin, but man cannot overthrow the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even after man fell, God's will toward man remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God still requires man to overthrow the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Oh, what an unchangeable God He is!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His way is unswerving and utterly straightforward.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must realize that God can never be overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this world there are some who receive many hard blows, but no one has been attacked daily and received continual blasts like God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet His will has never been overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What God was before man's fall, He is after man's fall and after sin entered into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The decision He affirmed aforetime is still His decision today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He has never changed.</S>
