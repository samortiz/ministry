        <h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BRING<br />
THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD TO THE LORD</h2>
<p>I hope that the newly saved brothers and sisters will pay attention to this matter. Once you are saved, you should gather your family members together and declare to them, &ldquo;From this day forward, my household belongs to God.&rdquo; You need to declare this whether or not they belong to the Lord and whether or not they agree. You are the head of the house and you should do this. You should take the matter into your own hands. You should declare that your household will serve the Lord. When you exercise your faith to stand firm this way, you will prevail.</p>
<p>If those who are saved through us are saved household by household instead of one by one, what a difference it will make! Brothers and sisters, do not be too loose with your children at home. One of the greatest failures of the Protestants is that they are too loose with their next generation; they allow their next generation to have the freedom to choose their own faith. The Catholics do not have to preach the gospel. Their increase through natural birth alone is greater than the increase the Protestants have in a lifetime. Have you seen Catholics preaching the gospel on street corners like the Salvation Army? No. They just propagate through natural birth, generation after generation. Two become four, and four become eight. Every Roman Catholic child automatically becomes a Roman Catholic. The Catholics do not pay much attention to increase from the outside. As long as a person is born into Catholicism, he is dragged into the religion whether or not he eventually becomes a true believer. It is no wonder that the Catholic population exceeds the Protestant population by more than three times. Do not be nonchalant in this matter, and do not allow your own children to drift away.</p>
<p>Let me repeat: A new believer needs to declare right from the start that his household belongs to the Lord. Not only must he be the Lord&rsquo;s individually; he also must declare that his household is the Lord&rsquo;s. Take full control of this matter, and it will be done for you. You have to declare again and again at home, &ldquo;As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. All who live in this house should decide to serve the Lord.&rdquo; You should bring your family to the Lord. You should not make any excuse. Do not allow anyone to drift away.</p>
<p>Household salvation is one of the greatest principles in the Bible. Once you are saved, your whole household should be saved. As an individual you must first stand firm for the Lord, and then your household will change. I hope that you will pay attention to this matter. This is a great blessing. If you do this, you will bring more people to the Lord. (<em>Messages for Building Up New Believers,</em> vol. 2, pp. 319-320)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>When we invite people to come to a meeting of the church, many will come by themselves. If we go to visit people in their homes, we will reach their whole household. From this we can realize that &ldquo;door-knocking&rdquo; reaches the household, not only one person. When we knock on people&rsquo;s doors, we are observing the principle of God&rsquo;s economy. It is a shame if we despise the God-ordained way of reaching people with the gospel. We must take this God-ordained way of preaching the gospel, which is according to the biblical revelation. (<em>Exercise and Practice of the God-ordained Way,</em> pp. 71-72)</p>
<h2 class="head1">GAINING THE WHOLE FAMILY</h2>
<p>When you go out to visit people, do not care for the number, but care for the family. Our goal is not to get only one individual. Our goal is to get one family. When we talk to people, our talk must pave the way to get the whole family. If it is only a couple, we have to have the goal not merely to gain the wife or the husband but to gain both. If the mother is pregnant, we must have the intention that we will gain this child also. We should gain every member of the family.</p>
<p>When you go, always exercise to gain the whole family. If you are preaching the gospel to a seventeen-year-old young man, you have to consider his parents. By baptizing this young man, you may spoil your work on the whole family. You have to exercise your wisdom to decide whether you should baptize him or not. If you do not baptize him, this does not mean that you give him up. Rather, this is a kind of preparation for you to get his parents and to get his whole family. If you go out persistently, you can gain at least two solid families each year. (<em>Exercise and Practice of the God-ordained Way,</em> pp. 81-82)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>However, no matter how good an example is set by the parents, how the children develop depends on God&rsquo;s mercy. On the one hand, the parents must keep a high standard, but on the other hand, they need to trust in the Lord. Day by day we should tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, these children are not mine; they are Your possession placed in my custody for a period of time. Lord, what I am doing with them is simply fulfilling my responsibility. How they will turn out, Lord, depends absolutely on Your mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is possible for parents to be selfish concerning the spiritual welfare of their children. If their children get saved and become spiritual, they are very happy. However, these parents may not be happy to see the children of other families becoming more spiritual than their children. Most parents in the church hope that their children will become the future apostles, elders, and deacons. Thus, even in this matter, we are selfish.</p>
<p>I once read of a certain woman who prayed desperately for her child to be saved. Although she prayed daily for years, still her child was not saved. One day she inquired of the Lord why He did not answer her prayers and keep His promise. The Lord told her that He would surely keep His promise and answer her prayers. However, she was too selfish. If she would stop praying so much for her child and begin to pray for the children of others, she would see His faithfulness. From that time onward, she began to pray for other children to be saved. After a short while, her child was saved.</p>
<p>This story illustrates the fact that we may be selfish even in praying for the salvation of our children. Not to pray for our children is wrong, but to be fully occupied with prayer for them in a selfish way is also wrong. Hence, the matter of the salvation of our children and their spiritual welfare is also a test to us. (<em>Life-study of Ephesians,</em> pp. 521-522)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>Although the Lord promised a child to Abraham, the child did not come for many years. The Lord even put Abraham into a situation in which he was forced to pray for the household of Abimelech so that they could have children (Gen. 20:17). If we were Abraham, we might have found it difficult to pray. We might have said, &ldquo;I am too pitiful. I have been praying for myself for many years, yet I have not received a child. How can I pray for them?&rdquo; However, when Abraham prayed, God answered the prayer not only for Abimelech but also for Abraham (21:1-2). If we turn our prayer from ourselves to others, we will receive what we desire (Job 42:10). It is because we are too self-centered in our prayer that the Lord needs to teach us a lesson. If we water others, we will be watered, and if we care for others, we will be cared for. (<em>The Normal Way of Fruit-bearing and Shepherding for the Building Up of the Church</em>, p. 39)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>I have seen many devoted Christians. Among them, one was Brother Nee. Not all of Brother Nee&rsquo;s brothers were properly saved. Brother Nee&rsquo;s mother was a sister who loved the Lord very much. It is no wonder that she would weep for her sons. I have seen many others like this. Even among us there are many good sisters who love the Lord very much and pray for their children nearly every day, even though their children do not believe. On the other hand, some parents are not so devoted, yet their children love the Lord. Eventually, I have bowed down before the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s word is true. We should raise up our children according to the Lord&rsquo;s teaching. This is our duty and we should do it, but eventually their salvation and seeking of the Lord depend upon God&rsquo;s eternal choosing and predestination. If our raising of our children could decide their spiritual future, this would be against God&rsquo;s predestination.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say who is chosen. We simply must do our duty to raise up our children according to the teaching of the Lord. Whether or not they have been chosen is not up to us. Some may say, &ldquo;Because it is not up to us, we need not do much.&rdquo; However, this also is wrong. (<em>A Word of Love to the Co-workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord,</em> pp. 12-13)</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
