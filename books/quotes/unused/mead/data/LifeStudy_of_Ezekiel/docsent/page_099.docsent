   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WOODEN INCENSE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The incense altar is made wholly of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every part, including the horns, is made of wood v. 22 . This is altogether different from the incense altar in the tabernacle erected by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The incense altar in the tabernacle was made of wood overlaid with gold, signifying humanity overlaid with divinity Exo 37:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The incense altar standing in this temple is made only of wood, signifying only the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the tabernacle and in the temple there were the altar, the lampstand, and the showbread table.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But here in Ezekiel the altar is also the table 41:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As an altar it is good for us to offer something to God, and as a table it is good for God to minister something to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The altar is for us to offer something to God for His satisfaction, and the table is good for God to prepare something for us for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the one altar serves two purposes: for us to God, it is the altar; for God to us it is the table.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We offer something of Christ to God on this altar, and God prepares something of Christ for us on this table.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both are upon the humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whatever is on this altar-table must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ on the altar is incense for God, and Christ on the table is food for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we offer Christ to God on it, it is the altar for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God prepares something of Christ for us on it, it is the table for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, Christ on the altar is incense, and Christ on the table is food.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The main point here is that the walls were covered with wood and that the incense altar was made of wood, signifying the humanity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The wooden incense altar was three cubits high and two cubits long.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This signifies the Triune God in resurrection as a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The altar, which was made of wood, was put in a place of wainscoted wood carved with cherubim and palm trees.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that if we are those who manifest the glory and victory of Christ, we will have the altar-table for God and us to have fellowship together in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here God enjoys the incense we offer in Christ and we enjoy the food supplied by God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this way, both we and God enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is satisfied because of the fragrance in Christ, and we are satisfied by the food supply in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we need to see that this mutual enjoyment can only be in an atmosphere and situation where there is a manifestation of the glory and victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we overcome through Christ and manifest the image and glory of Christ, then we will have an altar-table for us to fellowship with God and enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This fellowship and enjoyment issue from our victory in Christ and through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>NO LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this temple there is no lampstand for giving light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the tabernacle, there was no window, or opening, in the Holy Place, so it needed the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in the temple described in the book of Ezekiel, there are many windows letting in light and air.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, there is no need of a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE DOORS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both the outer temple and the inner temple had doors at the entrance v. 23 . At both gates there were two doors, each of two folding sections.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The gates were simply openings, but within the gates were doors which could be opened and closed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we apply this to our situation today, we may say that when positive ones, such as the apostles, come, we should surely open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, when negative ones, such as wolves Matt 7:15 , come, we must close the door.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Does the local church in your place have doors?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am concerned that the church in your locality may have only ways in but may not have gates with doors.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the church life we need the gates with the doors.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the one hand, we should be open to positive people and positive things; on the other hand, we should be closed to negative people and negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should shut the door and refuse to let them in. The function of the doors is similar to that of screens on windows: They are open to let in the positive things, but they are closed to keep out the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Each gate has two doors which are made of two pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This makes a total of four pieces on each gate Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>41:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fact that each door is made of two folding pieces shows us that the doors are flexible, turning and folding.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes in the church life the leading ones are not flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They do not know how to be folded and turned.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church needs turning, folding, flexible doors that are easy to open and easy to shut.</S>
