   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now in this message we need to consider thirty-five items of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the Word John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we say that Christ is the Word, we are not speaking of who Christ is, but of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Word is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I may have a great deal of feeling within me, but if I have no words, my feelings cannot be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when my feelings are expressed in words, then you are able to understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is the Word, the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although no one knows God, Christ as the Word speaks for God, defines God, and even declares God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hallelujah, Christ is the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 1:4, speaking of Christ as the Word, says, In Him was life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, Christ is life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Life causes us to be living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To come to the Word and be made living by it means to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if instead of becoming living, you are deadened, this indicates that you did not receive life; rather, you received death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every time we receive the Word in which there is life, we become living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is the Word, and He is also life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 1:4 also says that this life is the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, Christ also is light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you have life, then you have light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Anyone who is dead is absolutely in darkness, for death denotes darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, life indicates light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as we are living, we shall be in the light and be able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when someone dies, he is in darkness and sees nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 1:14 says, And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Grace is Christ for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is also the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Reality means the realization of what God is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Grace is related to life, and reality is related to light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Life is the essence, the substance, of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you have life, you will enjoy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Light is the realization of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you have light, you gain reality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, grace is connected to life, and reality is connected to light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to John 1:14, Christ is also the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ in the flesh was God s tabernacle, God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>John 1:29 indicates that Christ is the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This verse says, Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As the Lamb, Christ took away our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE LADDER</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John 1:51 says, Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This verse reveals that Christ is the ladder which Jacob saw in his dream Gen 28:10-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Jacob s dream is fulfilled in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ, the heavenly ladder, joins earth to heaven and connects God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In chapter one of the Gospel of John we have Christ as the tabernacle; in chapter two we see Him as the temple John 2:19, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is the temple of God, God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE BRASS SERPENT</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>John 3:14 reveals that Christ is also the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the children of Israel committed sin against God, many of them were bitten by serpents and died.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the children of Israel cried out to Moses, the Lord told him to lift up a brass serpent on a pole.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Everyone who looked at that serpent was forgiven, healed, and kept alive Num 21:4-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In John 3:14 the Lord said to Nicodemus, As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was lifted up as the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He died so that the serpent might be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As the Lamb, He died on the cross to take away our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But as the brass serpent, He died on the cross to destroy the old serpent, Satan, the devil Heb 2:14 .</S>
