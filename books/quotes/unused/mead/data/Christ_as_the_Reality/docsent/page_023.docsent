   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE HUMANITY OF JESUS IN LUKE Scripture Reading: Lev 2:4-7; Luke 2:40, 49, 51-52; 3:21-22; 4:1, 13-14, 18a, 22a, 28-30; 5:15-16; 6:11-12; 9:55; 10:21; 11:53-54; 19:41, 47; 22:28, 44, 51, 61; 24:19 DIFFERENT DEGREES OF THE MEAL OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we consider the humanity of Jesus in Luke, I feel that we still need to consider the appreciation of the meal offering in different degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We mentioned in the last chapter the different appreciations of the Lord Jesus as the burnt offering and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In each of these two offerings, there are three degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With the burnt offering there is the bullock, the sheep or goat, and the turtledove or pigeon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This does not mean that there are only three kinds of appreciations of Jesus as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It simply means that there are many different degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some are higher, some are lower, and some are between.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we come to the meal offering, there are also three degrees of appreciation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is something out of the oven, something out of the pan, and something out of the frying pan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all know what an oven is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is an enclosed container for cooking or baking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is entirely enclosed, unlike the pan, which is open at the top.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet the pan is deeper than the frying pan, which is the most open and shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of these different cooking utensils signify differing degrees of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The suffering in the oven is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the deepest and most hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seems that nothing is going on, but something is suffered in a hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the pan, the suffering is not so hidden or deep.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is rather open to everybody.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And the frying pan is even more shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, we can see the suffering in these three kinds of cooking utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we must realize that there is no difference with the Lord Jesus Himself; the difference is only in our appreciation, in our apprehension and understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How much we appreciate the Lord's suffering depends on how much we apprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The appreciation comes out of our apprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The cakes and the wafers in the oven are the most definite in form.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul mentions in Galatians 4:19 that Christ must be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cakes and wafers have a definite form.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the pan the fine flour is soaked and mingled with oil and divided into four portions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is inferior in form to the cakes and wafers in the oven, but it is not inferior in substance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The substance is the same as the cakes and wafers, but the form is not as definite or full.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the frying pan, the third category, there is just some fine flour and a little bit of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It has almost no form.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nor does it say that the flour is mingled with the oil, but just that the fine flour is with the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These three degrees should not be a mere doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must put these things into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do believe that we have brought something of Christ as the meal offering to the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But there is the matter of degree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is what we bring to the meeting definite in form and with the greatest suffering?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Or is it just a little of Christ, not having such a definite form, and with only fine flour and a little oil from the frying pan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I was young in the Lord, I appreciated Him so much.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But now when I look back, I realize that my appreciation of the Lord at that time was just the meal offering baked in the frying pan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There was no form and not much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By the Lord's mercy, I do believe that today I have some appreciation of the Lord as the cakes and wafers in the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is definite in form and with a greater suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE PROPER WORSHIP IN REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever we come to the church meetings, we must come with something of Christ as the meal offering, and some of the more mature ones must come with a meal offering baked in the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some of the younger ones will bring something of Christ as the meal offering from the frying pan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is still good.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all must bring something of Christ to the meetings as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We will present this as a kind of present to God to constitute the proper worship to Him in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Strictly speaking, among today's Christians, there is the service, the work, the preaching, and the teaching, but there is almost no worship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The worship that God desires is that the people of God would bring the very Christ whom they have experienced in their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy were all written about the worship to God, but there is hardly a word telling us to bow down and prostrate ourselves before the Lord.</S>
