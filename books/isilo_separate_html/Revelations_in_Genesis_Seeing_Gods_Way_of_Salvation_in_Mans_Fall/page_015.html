<h1 class="title">THE SECOND FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BACKGROUND, CAUSE, PROCESS,<br />
AND RESULT OF THE SECOND FALL</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we considered various details of the first fall of man and God&rsquo;s corresponding way of salvation. In this chapter we will consider the second fall of man. The fall of man involved more than one step. When a person falls, it usually involves more than one step. The first step of a fall must be avoided because it is rare for a fall to involve only one step. Adam&rsquo;s fall was like falling down a set of stairs. According to the record in Genesis, there are four steps to man&rsquo;s fall. By the fourth fall, man had fallen to the uttermost.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BACKGROUND OF MAN&rsquo;S SECOND FALL</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s second fall involved Cain. The first involved Adam, but the second involved Cain. Adam and Eve were Cain&rsquo;s parents. When Adam and Eve fell, they waited in fear and trembling for God&rsquo;s judgment and their death, but God came and promised that the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent on the head (Gen. 3:15). God promised that a seed of the woman would deal with her enemy. When Eve gave birth to a son, she thought that she had acquired the God-promised seed and named him Cain, which in Hebrew means &ldquo;acquired.&rdquo; Adam&rsquo;s hope and Eve&rsquo;s hope were in Cain; they thought that he was the promised seed of the woman. However, eventually Adam and Eve realized that Cain was not the object of their hope. He must have caused them much trouble, because they showed their discouragement and disappointment when they begot a second son and named him Abel, which means &ldquo;vanity.&rdquo; Vanity may be likened to vanishing vapor.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve were once full of hope, but their attitude changed, and they felt a sense of vanity. They hoped that the seed of the woman would save them, but Cain was not this seed. They were disappointed with Cain. Hence, when they begot Abel, they also had no hope in Abel. Nevertheless, God was pleased with Abel. This is wonderful. God does not value what man values; He values what man does not value. In other words, God does not want what man wants; He wants what man does not want.</p>
<p>There is a principle in the Bible: God does not want the first but the second. Cain was born first, and Abel was born second. Abel was the second. God does not want the first; He wants the second. This principle also applies to Abraham&rsquo;s sons, Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael was the first, but Isaac was the second (21:9-13). It also applies to Isaac&rsquo;s sons: Esau and Jacob. Esau was the first, but Jacob was the second. God did not want Esau; instead, He wanted Jacob (25:22-26; Rom. 9:12-13). In Exodus God also did not want the firstborn of the Egyptians (11:5). In the New Testament, in Luke 15, the older son was well behaved, but he did not have the enjoyment of his father&rsquo;s riches. Instead, the younger son, who left his father, enjoyed all his father&rsquo;s riches (vv. 11-32). When I was young, I was indignant after reading this portion of the Bible. I asked myself whether all firstborns were bad and whether all who were born second were good. Slowly, I came to understand the meaning of this principle. In the Bible the firstborn always signifies Adam, but the second signifies Christ. Adam is the first man, but Christ is the second man (1 Cor. 15:45-47). This means that all those who are &ldquo;first,&rdquo; who are in Adam, are rejected by God. God accepts only the &ldquo;second,&rdquo; those who are in Christ.</p>
<p>Before Cain fell, Adam was full of hope for Cain. Adam&rsquo;s disappointment was expressed in the name Abel. What man hoped in was the opposite of what God wanted. This reveals that everything depends on God, not on man. Everything is with God, not with man. When things depend on man, man fails and falls, but when things depend on God, man is accepted by God and does not fall.</p>
<p>The background of man&rsquo;s second fall is that man had already fallen, man had God&rsquo;s promise to save, and man had God&rsquo;s way of salvation. Therefore, man should have been saved by God. Regrettably, man still fell.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cause of Man&rsquo;s Second Fall</h2>
<p>There were two causes of man&rsquo;s second fall.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Man&rsquo;s Being Gained by Satan</h2>
<p>The cause of man&rsquo;s first fall was that man was tempted by the serpent. The cause of man&rsquo;s second fall was that he was gained by Satan. Being gained by Satan is very close to being tempted by the serpent, but there is a distinction. In Genesis 3 Satan hid in a serpent and tempted man to fall; Satan was outside of man. In chapter 4 Satan was no longer outside of man; he was within man. Therefore, even though Satan was not mentioned, he was fully involved in man&rsquo;s second fall, for he was hidden inside Cain. The New Testament says, &ldquo;Cain was of the evil one&rdquo; (1 John 3:12). This indicates that Cain was of the devil. In man&rsquo;s first fall Satan tempted man from without, but by the time of man&rsquo;s second fall Satan was hidden in man. Man had only to be slightly careless and act on his own in order to be gained by Satan.</p>
<p>Christians are often afraid of being tempted by the devil to sin. However, Satan is mixed with our fallen nature; he does not need to tempt us. Whenever we act on our own instead of rejecting ourselves, we are being gained by Satan. Because Satan was not in our forefathers before the first fall, there was a need to tempt them from without. After Adam fell, however, Satan was mixed with man&rsquo;s fallen nature and no longer needed to tempt man. If man does not deny himself and instead relies on himself, he will follow Satan and be gained by Satan.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
