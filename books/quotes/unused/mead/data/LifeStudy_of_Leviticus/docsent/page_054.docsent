   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FRANKINCENSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third element is frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In typology frankincense signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The sweet savor of frankincense signifies the fragrance of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How sweet Christ is in His resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>SALT</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fourth element of the meal offering is salt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In typology salt signifies the death, or the cross, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Salt seasons, kills germs, and preserves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the effect of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>NO LEAVEN OR HONEY IN THE MEAL OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The meal offering is to have neither leaven nor honey.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Leaven signifies sin and other negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Gospels the Lord Jesus speaks of the leaven of the Pharisees, the leaven of the Sadducees, and the leaven of Herod Matt 16:6, 11-12; Luke 12:1; Mark 8:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Honey signifies the natural human life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It signifies our natural life not in its bad aspect but in its good aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not think that people are always bad, for sometimes they are very good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But this natural goodness is honey.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hatred is leaven, but natural love is honey.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Likewise, pride is leaven, but natural humility is honey.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Honey seems to be different from leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, after a period of time honey can ferment, and this fermentation will issue in leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that whether we are good or bad, the result will eventually be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the reason Genesis 2 speaks of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may be either good or bad, but in either case the result will be leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may use divorce as an illustration of the fermentation of honey.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With a marriage that ends in divorce, a certain kind of honey natural love has fermented and issued in leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From this illustration we see that the issue of both hatred, which is leaven, and natural love, which is honey, is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The negative things are leaven, and the good aspects of the natural life signified by honey eventually ferment and become leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The life Christ lived on earth was a life without leaven and without honey, and we should live the same kind of life today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to have the four positive elements fine flour, oil, frankincense, and salt but not the two negative elements leaven and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If this is our situation, we will be a proper meal offering, an offering composed of humanity oiled with divinity in resurrection through Christ's death and without leaven and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of life is food to satisfy God and also to nourish us as God's serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE PORTRAIT IN THE FOUR GOSPELS OF CHRIST'S HUMAN LIVING ON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the four Gospels we have a portrait of Christ's human living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was God in eternity, but through incarnation He became a real man, and He lived on earth as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit in Christ's Human Living</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ's humanity has much to do with the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was conceived of the Holy Spirit Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From the time of conception, that is, from the very beginning of His manhood, His humanity was wrapped up with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Apart from the Holy Spirit, Jesus could not have been conceived and born.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord's conception and birth were altogether of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His humanity was mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ's human living was based on this mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the Lord Jesus came forth to minister for God, He was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"As Jesus was baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form as a dove upon Him" Luke 3:21b-22a .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fact that the Holy Spirit descended in the form of a dove, which is known for its gentleness, indicates that the Spirit of God is a person and not merely a power, channel, or instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Holy Spirit as a person came upon the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that just as oil was poured upon the fine flour, the Holy Spirit was poured upon the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the one hand, in His humanity He was mingled with the Holy Spirit; on the other hand, the Holy Spirit was poured upon Him and anointed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first part of Luke 4:1 speaks of "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was full of the Spirit, thoroughly oiled with the Spirit, because He was mingled with the Spirit and because the Spirit had been poured upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He thus behaved and worked in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything He did in His ministry was done in the Spirit in the essential Spirit and also in the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is a man mingled with the Spirit and with the Spirit poured upon Him.</S>
