After the conference I may go with Brother Weigh. He will go to Hsia-Kwan and Bao-Shan and work there. Presently, Brother Lin Kwang-tsao is engaged in construction work with the Highway Department in Hsia-Kwan. When will Brother Nee return? We remember him!</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Hsu Jung-jieh, March 19</p><h2 class="head2">The Work in a Few Places in West Hunan</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Recently there was a week of gospel meetings in Chou-Jia-Dien in the Alliance Gospel Hall. There will be ten days of edification meetings for believers on March 6-15. Some may come from Ch'ang-Teh. We will have two meetings every day. After the meetings we will visit Brother Chang Gung-jih in Tung-Ping, An-Hua. Later, we will pass by Yuan-Jiang and Yi-Yang and then go to Chi-Li and Dah-Yung. May the Lord grant me a healthy body to work in these places on my return journey. Please pray for me. May the Lord open a great door for the preaching of the Word in west Hunan. Brother Shang Jiu-tze has decided to travel with me.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Han Fu-shen, March 1</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>A seventeen-day conference is about to conclude in Chou-Jia-Dien. God has blessed us. Brother Mei Han-ke and his whole family have been greatly revived. Soon a few people will be baptized. We intend to leave Ch'ang-Teh for Dah-Yung around the twenty-second or twenty-third of March. Dah-Yung has invited us a few times and is very hungry and seeking. In April they will have their annual retreat and have invited Brother Han to go. After staying in Dah-Yung for a month or so, we intend to go to Chi-Li. Then we will turn to Szechuan or to Yuan-Ling. May the Lord open a great door in west Hunan and glorify His own name through us useless ones.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Shang Jiu-tze, March 12</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Lan Tsi-yi, Hankow</h2><p>Since quitting the work at the refugee center, I have been living with Brother Hu in Chen's house in Bai-Tse Alley. During the past days I have been remaining quietly in the Lord, praying, studying the Bible, and learning to take God's dealing. Through His enlightening I have realized that I do not know God. I am not yet perfected and am far from being a vessel of the Lord. There is some comfort in the work at the orphanage.</p><p>During the past two or three months, the Lord has been showing me that much of my zeal for Him in the past, much of the work I was engaged in, and many of the things that I have written to the saints in my correspondence were done out of ignorance. Many of my prayers and pursuits, though honest in motive, were but expressions of my ignorance. I thought that it was good to be pure in heart and honest in conduct. Now I know that ignorance is a sin, and I am beginning to understand the meaning of the words: "We should imitate faith but not the act of faith." I am still inquiring of God and looking to Him day by day as to what my future should be. He delights not in the strength of the horse or the legs of man. He takes pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that hope in His mercy. The brothers in Hankow are all well.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi, March 15</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_091.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_093.html">Next</a> </body></html>
