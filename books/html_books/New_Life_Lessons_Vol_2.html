WITH THE LORD</h1>
<p>One of the most important and practical things in the life of a Christian is to live in fellowship with the Lord. All those who desire to grow in life must pay attention to this one thing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE MEANING OF FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</strong>  1 John 1:3b</p>
<p>In the Bible the word <em>fellowship</em> means &ldquo;joint participation, partaking in common.&rdquo; When we believed into the Son of God, He entered into us, and we received the divine life. As a result, this life flows within us, creating a flow between us and God.</p>
<p>This fellowship is carried on by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit. Hence, it is also called the &ldquo;fellowship of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo;</strong> 2 Corinthians 13:14</p>
<p>Hence, our fellowship with the Lord is according to the Holy Spirit in our spirit in the flow of the divine life, that we may have a direct, intimate contact with God. This keeps us in the participation and enjoyment of the divine love and grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. A LIFE OF FELLOWSHIP&mdash;<br />
ABIDING IN THE LORD</h2>
<p>The Christian life is a life of fellowship. No Christian can live normally apart from God or independently from God. This relationship can be illustrated by that between the branches and the vine:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I [the Lord] am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him,...for apart from Me you can do nothing.&rdquo;</strong>  John 15:5</p>
<p>Our mutual abiding in the Lord is the mutual fellowship. Every believer in Christ is a branch in this true vine of the Lord. Once we see this fact, we should maintain the fellowship between us and the Lord, so that we will not be cut off from the enjoyment of His rich supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE CONDITIONS FOR FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>According to the Word of God and the believers&rsquo; experience, it is possible for this fellowship to be broken. Hence, in order to enjoy this fellowship with the Lord, we must fulfill some requirements.</p>
<p>1. WALKING IN THE LIGHT</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another.&rdquo;</strong> 1 John 1:7a</p>
<p>God is light. If we want to fellowship with Him, we must also be in the light. In order for us to be in the light, we must abide in the Lord. Once we are not in the light, the fellowship is cut off, and we feel uneasy, empty, and darkened.</p>
<p>2. CONFESSING OUR SINS</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&rdquo;</strong>  1 John 1:9</p>
<p>All unrighteousness is sin. Sin means wrongdoing either against God or against men.</p>
<p>Once we sin, we must confess before God. He will forgive us according to His Word and based upon the redemption of the blood of Jesus. In this way the broken fellowship will be recovered, and we will have a conscience without offense to enjoy Him without interruption.</p>
<p>3. LOVING GOD AND THE BROTHERS</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him.&rdquo;</strong>  1 John 2:10</p>
<p>God is light. He is also love. As we live in God, spontaneously we love the brothers, which indicates that we are abiding in the light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE PRACTICE OF FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>Most of the problems experienced by Christians are related to the matter of fellowship. It is very crucial that all the saved ones learn this lesson.</p>
<p>Now let us look at some practical ways to fellowship with the Lord. According to our experience, these practical ways are mainly prayer and the reading of the Bible. We have covered these two topics in the previous lessons. Here we will only point them out in a brief way, including the steps of fellowship.</p>
<p>1. PRAYER</p>
<p>The purpose of prayer is to contact God and fellowship with God, not mainly to ask for things. There are a few key points to prayer:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Speak the truth from the heart</strong></p>
<p>When you come before God, you should first calm down your thoughts. Then you should pray according to the inward sense. Do not compose, and do not worry if you are saying the right thing or not. Just come as a child comes to his parents, saying whatever you feel in your heart. Let every word you utter be out of sincerity.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Do not pray from memory</strong></p>
<p>While you are fellowshipping with the Lord, do not try to recall all the things that you should pray for while neglecting to contact God. Do not be so entangled with petty affairs that you lose God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Under the enlightenment, confess your sins, relying on the blood</strong></p>
<p>In your prayer, if you feel that you have sinned, you should confess your sins thoroughly one by one, relying on the blood of Jesus, and ask God for forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>(4) Praise and give thanks</strong></p>
<p>After you have confessed your sins thoroughly, often you will want to express praise and thanksgiving to the Lord. You should do this uninhibitedly.</p>
<p>2. READING THE BIBLE</p>
<p>When you read the Bible for fellowship, you must remember a few things:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Do not read for the sake of studying</strong></p>
<p>When reading the Word, avoid merely studying to gain knowledge. You should turn to God in a simple and spontaneous way.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Seek after the Lord with a single heart</strong></p>
<p>Our Lord is in His Word; He Himself even is the Word. When you read the Word you should come to contact this living person.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Sense the nourishment and supply in the Word</strong></p>
<p>When you use your spirit to read the Word and to maintain your contact with the Lord, you will have the sense of enlightenment and satisfaction within.</p>
<p><strong>(4) Turn the feelings you receive in the spirit into prayer</strong></p>
<p>In this kind of reading for fellowship, often you will touch the feelings of God. If you turn all these feelings into prayers to God, this will be the best fellowship you have with Him.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are a few more practical points which you should take care of:</p>
<p>3. TIME</p>
<p><strong>(1) At every time</strong></p>
<p>A Christian cannot be separated from God at any time. Whether in the morning or in the evening, he should exercise to have fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Set aside a definite time</strong></p>
<p>On the one hand, we need to live in the fellowship all the time. On the other hand, we need to set aside a definite time to fellowship with the Lord. The best time is in the early morning. It is also very good if we can spend some more time in the evening, or at any other time. This will help our life of fellowship tremendously.</p>
<p>4. PLACE</p>
<p><strong>(1) In every place</strong></p>
<p>Whether at home, in the meeting hall, at school, in the office, on the road, in the car, or in any place, we can have fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Select a place</strong></p>
<p>Although we can fellowship with the Lord anywhere, many times we need to find a quiet place for fellowship in order to avoid interruption and to enter in more singlemindedly and deeply. This is also very important.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE EFFECT OF FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>We can look at this from two sides:</p>
<p><strong>1. The negative side:</strong> Fellowship eliminates gradually, step by step, all the things that need to be dealt with. Among these the main items are sins, the world, and the old man. If we have good fellowship with the Lord, there will not be a single time in which there is no dealing on the negative side.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.&rdquo;</strong>  1 John 1:7</p>
<p><strong>2. The positive side:</strong> This fellowship adds the element of God into us bit by bit. This is like the process of metabolism in our body; there is a continual exchange in which the old elements are taken away and the new elements are added in. The more we live in the fellowship, the more this metabolism operates.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Corinthians 1:9</p>
<p>The more we enter into fellowship with the Lord, the more we enjoy Him as our portion from God, and the more we are filled and occupied by Him.</p>
<p>From the above two sides of the effect of fellowship, we can see that the growth and the transformation of a Christian hinges completely on his fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p>Now let us summarize the effect of fellowshipping with the Lord with the following words:</p>
<p><strong>It is a cycle of the spiritual life.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0736318208_01.jpg" width="265" height="127" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>The divine life that we received from God produces a fellowship of the divine life. This fellowship of the divine life brings in the divine light. The divine light increases the need for the blood of Jesus, which causes us to receive more of the divine life.</p>
<p>Such a cycle will bring us onward in the growth of the divine life until we reach its maturity.</p><h1 class="msg">CONSECRATION</h1>
<p>After a person is saved, if he desires to grow in life and to allow God to do a thorough work on him, he must consecrate himself to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE BASIS OF CONSECRATION&mdash;<br />
THE REDEMPTION OF GOD</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;You are not your own...For you were bought with a price.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Corinthians 6:19-20</p>
<p>The Lord shed His priceless blood on the cross to purchase you. Therefore, you belong to Him.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But now, having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God...&rdquo;</strong> Romans 6:22</p>
<p>When we were saved, God redeemed us from under the curse of the law. We were rescued from the hand of Satan, from sin, from the world, and from death.</p>
<p>Consecration is our recognition of God&rsquo;s legal claim on us, giving God the right that is due Him.</p>
<p>Hence, it is reasonable that we consecrate ourselves to God. This is our &ldquo;most reasonable service&rdquo; (Rom. 12:1).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE MOTIVE OF CONSECRATION&mdash;<br />
THE LOVE OF GOD</h2>
<p>1. THE CONSTRAINING OF LOVE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For the love of Christ constrains us, having judged this, that One died on behalf of all; therefore all died; and He died on behalf of all, that those who live may no longer live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and has been raised.&rdquo;</strong>  2 Corinthians 5:14-15</p>
<p>The love which Christ exhibited in His substitutionary death is our motivating power; it constrains us to live to Him.</p>
<p>2. THE BESEECHING OF LOVE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 12:1</p>
<p>3. THE CALLING OF LOVE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Jesus said to Simon Peter...do you love Me more than these?&rdquo;</strong>  John 21:15</p>
<p>The Lord often asks within us, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than the world? Do you love Me more than knowledge, fame, parents, wife, and children?&rdquo; Who can resist His love?</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE INCENTIVE<br />
TO CONSECRATION&mdash;<br />
THE REVELATION OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">(1) Seeing the Eternal Purpose<br />
of God in the Universe, Resulting<br />
in Our Giving Ourselves to It</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the multifarious wisdom of God.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 3:10</p>
<p>When Paul saw the purpose of God, he gave himself willingly to be the prisoner of Christ Jesus (Eph. 3:1).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, when Nehemiah saw the will of God, he strove to do a good work even unto death (Neh. 2:18; 6:11).</p>
<h2 class="head2">(2) Seeing the Preciousness<br />
of the Lord, Resulting in Our Life-long Commitment to Him</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life.&rdquo;</strong>  John 6:68</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ.&rdquo;</strong>  Philippians 3:8</p>
<h2 class="head2">(3) Seeing the Coming Glory,<br />
Resulting in Our Willingness<br />
to Suffer and to Sacrifice for Him</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Jesus...for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame.&rdquo;</strong> Hebrews 12:2</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE MEANING OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>Consecration is not to donate money, to become a preacher, or to work for the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>1. It is to hand over our rights to God and to have God rule over us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. It is to offer ourselves as a sacrifice to God for His satisfaction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Present your bodies a living sacrifice.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 12:1</p>
<p>A consecrated person is like a bullock or a lamb that is offered on the altar:</p>
<p class="indent1">his <strong>position</strong> is changed, and<br />
his <strong>use</strong> is changed.</p>
<p>Formerly, he was in his own hand, for his own use.</p>
<p>Now he is in God&rsquo;s hand, for God&rsquo;s use.</p>
<p>This makes him a sweet-smelling savor,<br />
a sacrifice well-pleasing to God,<br />
to satisfy God.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE RESULT OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>1. BECOMING A SWEET-SMELLING SAVOR</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.&rdquo;</strong>  Leviticus 1:9</p>
<p>Before man&mdash;we become ashes.<br />
Before God&mdash;we become<br />
a sweet-smelling savor.</p>
<p>2. LETTING GOD WORK ON US</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 2:10</p>
<p>When we consecrate ourselves to God we are saying that we consent to His working on us, in order that He may work Himself with all His riches into our being.</p>
<p>3. GROWING IN LIFE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.&rdquo;</strong> Romans 6:19</p>
<p>When we consecrate ourselves to God, God&rsquo;s life has the opportunity to work in us to separate us from everything that is common, so that we may be sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE PRACTICE OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>1. WHAT DO WE CONSECRATE?</p>
<h2 class="head2">(1) Ourselves</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;They gave themselves first to the Lord...through the will of God.&rdquo;</strong> 2 Corinthians 8:5</p>
<h2 class="head2">(2) Our Bodies</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Present...your members as weapons of righteousness to God.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 6:13</p>
<h2 class="head2">(3) Our Possessions</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on the earth,...but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,...for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&rdquo;</strong>  Matthew 6:19-21</p>
<h2 class="head2">(4) Our Best</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;All the best...the firstfruits of them which they [the Israelites] shall offer unto the Lord.&rdquo;</strong>  Numbers 18:12</p>
<h2 class="head2">(5) Our All</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;...put in all the livelihood which she had.&rdquo;</strong>  Luke 21:4</p>
<p>2. PASSING THROUGH THE GATE OF<br />
CONSECRATION&mdash;THOROUGHLY,<br />
ONCE FOR ALL</p>
<p>You should have a thorough confession and prayer once before the Lord. You must hand over to Him everything that you are, everything that you can do, and everything that you have.</p>
<p>Please itemize below everything that you should consecrate to God:</p>
<p>3. WALKING IN THE WAY OF CONSECRATION&mdash;DAILY RENEWING OUR CONSECRATION</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it.&rdquo;</strong>  Leviticus 6:12</p>
<p>To walk in the way of consecration, we need to consecrate daily and consecrate everything.</p>
<p>Please remember: Your consecration has been accepted by God, and you cannot repent of it.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Lord, I consecrate the following completely to You:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h1 class="msg">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<p>After a saved person has consecrated himself, he should learn to live in the spirit and walk according to the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE THREE PARTS OF MAN&mdash;<br />
SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Thessalonians 5:23</p>
<p>The above passage points out strongly that man has three distinct parts: spirit, soul, and body.</p>
<p>There are three different realms in the universe: physical, psychological, and spiritual. Because man has three distinct parts, he can contact the things in these three realms.</p>
<p><strong>1. The body:</strong> This is our outer part, which has five senses. It is in this part that we have &ldquo;world-consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2. The soul:</strong> This is our self, which is the ego, the personality. It is between the body and the spirit, and includes our mind, emotion, and will. It is here that we have &ldquo;self-consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>3. The spirit:</strong> This is the deepest part of our being, where we have &ldquo;God-consciousness.&rdquo; Here we can contact God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE HUMAN SPIRIT&mdash;<br />
THE KEY TO CONTACTING GOD</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him.&rdquo;</strong>  John 4:23</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 2:22</p>
<p>Today our spirit is the dwelling place of God. We must worship Him in this unique place, our spirit.</p>
<p>According to the teaching of the Bible, and based on the believers&rsquo; experience, there are three functions of the human spirit:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0736318208_03-1.jpg" width="264" height="122" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Conscience:</strong> This is the discerning faculty. It discerns right and wrong, and consequently condemns or justifies (Rom. 9:1).</p>
<p><strong>2. Intuition:</strong> This is the faculty by which we have the direct sense of God and receive knowledge from God (1 Cor. 2:11).</p>
<p><strong>3. Fellowship:</strong> This is the faculty by which we worship, contact, and communicate with God (1 Cor. 2:13).</p>
<p>These three parts work constantly together, and their functions are deeply related.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE LORD IS THE SPIRIT&mdash;<br />
THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The last Adam [Christ] became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Corinthians 15:45b</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And the Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo;</strong>  2 Corinthians 3:17</p>
<p>The Spirit is the coming of the Triune God to His chosen people. In order to accomplish this divine economy, Christ passed through four major steps: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0736318208_03-2.jpg" width="286" height="153" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Through such a process, the Spirit of God, who formerly possessed only divinity, is now compounded with the elements of Christ&rsquo;s humanity, His human living, the effectiveness and fragrance of His death, and the power and effectiveness of His resurrection, to become an all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE HOLY OINTMENT&mdash;<br />
A TYPE OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The holy ointment in Exodus 30:23-25, as a compound of pure olive oil and four kinds of spices, is a full type of the compound Spirit of God.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0736318208_3-3.jpg" width="265" height="81" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>1. Myrrh: signifies the death of Christ.</p>
<p>2. Cinnamon: signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>3. Calamus: signifies the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>4. Cassia: signifies the power and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&rdquo;</strong>  John 7:39</p>
<p>This means that before the Lord was glorified, the compound Spirit was not yet in existence. It was after His resurrection that the compound Spirit was completed and entered into the believers to become one spirit with them.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Corinthians 6:17</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE MEANING OF<br />
LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Christ today is the Spirit. As such a Spirit, He comes with all His riches into our regenerated spirit to join Himself to us to be our life and everything. If we realize this, we should live in the spirit.</p>
<p>1. WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</p>
<p>The basic rule in the life of a Christian is to be led and regulated by the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;As therefore you received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&rdquo;</strong>  Colossians 2:6</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo;</strong> Galatians 5:25</p>
<p>Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit is the sphere of our daily living. If we walk in Him, we will enjoy all His riches.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there are many commands, such as &ldquo;Love your neighbor as yourself,&rdquo; &ldquo;Being subject to one another,&rdquo; &ldquo;Abstain from fleshly lusts,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let us not become vainglorious.&rdquo; We must realize that these words are not for us to strive to keep by our own effort. It is only when we speak, walk, and behave according to the Spirit that we can live out all these virtues of Christ.</p>
<p>2. SETTING THE MIND ON THE SPIRIT</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 8:6</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth.&rdquo;</strong>  Colossians 3:2</p>
<p>The mind represents the person and is the key to our daily walk. Our mind should not be independent from the spirit. Rather, it should obey the Spirit and mind the things of God.</p>
<p>3. OBEYING THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And as for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things...&rdquo;</strong> 1 John 2:27a</p>
<p>The anointing is the inward moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit. It guides us in all things, not through the outward teaching of words, but through the inward anointing of the spiritual sense, teaching us inwardly.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should not live in the realm of right and wrong, of do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts. Rather, we should just take care of our inward feeling purely and directly. In this way the essence of God will be added to our whole being; we will be saturated with Him and will abide in the fellowship of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE PRACTICE OF LIVING<br />
IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Since living in the spirit is so crucial to our Christian experience, how then should we practice this in our daily life?</p>
<p>1. BY CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;No one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Corinthians 12:3b</p>
<p>When we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; with a proper spirit, we are in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, to call on the Lord Jesus is the simplest way to turn to the spirit to enjoy and experience the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>2. BY PRAYING</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Unceasingly pray.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Thessalonians 5:17</p>
<p>To pray unceasingly does not mean that we continue to pray for many things. It means that we contact God in our spirit so that we live in an atmosphere of prayer all day long. In this way we enjoy His anointing.</p>
<p>3. BY PRAY-READING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</p>
<p>The word of God is spirit; it is also God Himself. When we pray with the Lord&rsquo;s Word, our minds will be preserved to be set on the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE RESULT OF LIVING IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>1. OVERCOMING THE FLESH</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.&rdquo;</strong> Galatians 5:16</p>
<p>2. FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENT OF THE LAW OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 8:4</p>
<p>3. ENJOYING LIFE AND PEACE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 8:6b</p><h1 class="msg">EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h1>
<p>In the previous lessons we saw that the Christ who passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and ultimately became the Spirit, has now entered into us to be our life. He is the center and focus of our Christian life. All of our spiritual experiences are intimately related to Him.</p>
<p>In this lesson we will help you to know more concerning this living person, that you may enjoy Him more and apply Him to your daily life in a practical way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SUBJECTIVE CHRIST<br />
IN OUR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals Christ in two aspects:</p>
<p>1. THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT</p>
<p>Christ resurrected and ascended to be the Lord of all.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;God has made Him both Lord and Christ&mdash;this Jesus whom you crucified.&rdquo;</strong> Acts 2:36</p>
<p>Today He is our High Priest in the heavens interceding for us.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus.&rdquo;</strong>  Hebrews 4:14</p>
<p>One day He will come back from the heavens.</p>
<p>2. THE SUBJECTIVE ASPECT</p>
<p>Christ resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit to enter into the believers&rsquo; spirit to become their life and to transform them.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And we all...beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image... even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo;</strong> 2 Corinthians 3:18</p>
<p>Finally, He will be magnified in us, so that for us to live is Christ.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death; for to me to live is Christ.&rdquo;</strong> Philippians 1:20-21</p>
<p>As the ascended and glorified Lord, Christ is objective; but as the indwelling Spirit within us, He is subjective, experiential, and enjoyable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. CHRIST IS THE PORTION<br />
OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>1. CHRIST IS THE UNIQUE PORTION GIVEN BY GOD TO THE SAINTS</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.&rdquo;</strong> Colossians 1:12</p>
<p>The word <em>portion</em> in Greek can also be translated &ldquo;lot.&rdquo; This is based on the background of the good land recorded in the Old Testament. God gave the good land to His chosen people to be their inheritance and enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;A land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.&rdquo;</strong> Deuteronomy 8:7-9</p>
<p>The good land with all its riches is a type of the all-inclusive Christ as everything to us.</p>
<p>2. ENJOYING CHRIST AS GOD&rsquo;S PORTION FOR US</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Corinthians 1:9</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire is to dispense Himself in Christ into us. For this He has called us to partake of and enjoy this all-inclusive Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE NEED TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST</h2>
<p>In chapters three through eleven of the Gospel of John, we see the different needs of various kinds of people. One by one, all these needs are met by the Lord of life.</p>
<p><strong>1. The moral:</strong> represented by Nicodemus, an upper-class man. Because he sought Jesus, he received life&rsquo;s regenerating.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</strong>  John 3:3</p>
<p><strong>2. The immoral:</strong> An immoral woman, at the moment when she was most thirsty, met the Savior, and experienced life&rsquo;s satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.&rdquo;</strong> John 4:14</p>
<p><strong>3. The dying:</strong> By the word of life the Lord healed the dying son of a royal official; thus he received life&rsquo;s healing.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Jesus said to him, Go, your son is living. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him and went his way.&rdquo;</strong> John 4:50</p>
<p><strong>4. The impotent:</strong> By God&rsquo;s mercy, a man who lay in his sickness for thirty-eight years received life&rsquo;s enlivening.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Jesus said to him, Rise, pick up your bed and walk.&rdquo;</strong>  John 5:8</p>
<p><strong>5. The hungry:</strong> A hungry crowd, through Christ&rsquo;s rich supply of life, enjoyed life&rsquo;s feeding.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Jesus then took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to those who were seated; likewise also of the fishes, as much as they wanted.&rdquo;</strong> John 6:11</p>
<p><strong>6. The thirsty:</strong> When the human enjoyment came to its end, the Lord was there as the river of living water for man to receive life&rsquo;s thirst-quenching.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo;</strong>  John 7:37-38</p>
<p><strong>7. Those under the bondage of sin:</strong> The Lord as the light of the world rescued a woman in sin; thus she received life&rsquo;s setting free.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&rdquo;</strong>  John 8:12</p>
<p><strong>8. The blind:</strong> A man who was born blind, through the anointing of the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit, received life&rsquo;s sight.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash; so I went and washed, and I received sight.&rdquo;</strong> John 9:11</p>
<p><strong>9. The dead:</strong> The Lord turned death into life. Through Him the dead and buried Lazarus received life&rsquo;s resurrecting.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, even if he should die, shall live.&rdquo;</strong> John 11:25</p>
<p>The above nine cases not only represent the conditions of various kinds of people; they describe the need of every man. Only the Son of God can fully meet these needs.</p>
<p>This shows us that if we experience Christ, all of our needs will be fully met.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE SECRET<br />
OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<p>1. ENJOYING THE BOUNTIFUL SPIRIT</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</strong>  Philippians 1:19</p>
<p>In the previous lesson we saw that after Christ passed through the process of glorification, He became the compound, life-giving Spirit. With all His rich and bountiful elements He is like an all-inclusive drink which is sufficient to meet all our needs.</p>
<p>If we drink of the Spirit by <strong>calling on His name</strong> and <strong>pray-reading His Word</strong> often, we will receive a continual supply to experience Christ.</p>
<p>2. RECEIVING THE RICH WORD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo;</strong>  Colossians 3:16</p>
<p>The bountiful supply of the Spirit is embodied in God&rsquo;s rich word. If we daily <strong>pray His word and sing His word,</strong> and let His word dwell in us richly, we will be nourished and strengthened to experience Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE RESULT<br />
OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<p>What fills a man inwardly will be spontaneously manifested outwardly. If we continually experience Christ and receive Him as our life and everything, we will become the expression of Christ.</p>
<p>1. LIVING CHRIST</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For to me to live is Christ.&rdquo;</strong> Philippians 1:21</p>
<p>The normal experience of Christ is to live Him. To live Christ means that we take Him as life in any kind of circumstance so that our living is just Christ lived out. In this way Christ will:</p>
<h2 class="head2">(1) Be revealed in us</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me.&rdquo;</strong>  Galatians 1:15-16</p>
<h2 class="head2">(2) Live in us</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&rdquo;</strong>  Galatians 2:20</p>
<h2 class="head2">(3) Make home in us</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 3:17</p>
<h2 class="head2">(4) Be formed in us</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you.&rdquo;</strong> Galatians 4:19</p>
<p>2. EXPRESSED THROUGH THE CHURCH</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 1:22b-23</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ and also the fullness of Christ. This fullness comes out of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s riches are unsearchable (Eph. 3:8). When we <strong>experience Christ</strong> and <strong>enjoy His riches</strong> continually, we will <strong>become His fullness.</strong></p><h1 class="msg">KNOWING THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>After we are saved and have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ, we still need to go on to know the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. WHAT IS THE CHURCH?</h2>
<p>The first time you heard the word <em>church,</em> what did you think the church was?</p>
<p>The church is not a cathedral,<br />
a chapel, or a meeting hall. <br />
It is not a house or a building. <br />
It is not a human organization. <br />
It is not a religious group.</p>
<p>1. THE CHURCH IS THE CONGREGATION OF THE CALLED ONES</p>
<p>In the original language the word <em>church</em> is <em>ekklesia.</em> It is composed of two words. The first word is <em>ek,</em> which means &ldquo;out,&rdquo; and the second is derived from <em>kaleo,</em> which means &ldquo;to call.&rdquo; When these two words are put together, they mean a congregation of called out ones, or a gathering of the called ones.</p>
<p>Hence, from the meaning of the word itself, the church is a group of people called out of the world by God to gather together.</p>
<p>2. THE CHURCH IS THE BODY OF CHRIST</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 1:22b-23</p>
<h2 class="head2">(1) The Fullness of Christ</h2>
<p>The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ as His expression. The church as the fullness of Christ is the overflow of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">(2) That Which Comes out of Christ</h2>
<p>As Eve came out of Adam (Gen. 2:21-24), so also the church is out of Christ.</p>
<p>From this we know that:</p>
<p>The church is a living organism, <br />
not a dead organization.<br />
The church takes Christ as her Head.<br />
The church shares the same<br />
life and nature as Christ.<br />
The church is the fullness of Christ, <br />
the expression of Christ.</p>
<p>3. THE CHURCH IS THE HOUSE OF THE LIVING GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Timothy 3:15</p>
<p>The church is the house of God,<br />
the place of His rest.<br />
The church is the place where God<br />
manifests Himself on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH<br />
IN RELATION TO GOD</h2>
<p>1. TO EXPRESS GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His [God&rsquo;s] will.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 1:5</p>
<p>The meaning of sonship through Jesus Christ is that through Him we are redeemed and regenerated to become the children of God, possessing the life and position of God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>God predestinated us (the church) to receive sonship, so that He Himself may be expressed through us.</p>
<p>2. TO DEAL WITH THE ENEMY</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the multifarious wisdom of God.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 3:10</p>
<p>The rulers and authorities in the heavenlies here refer especially to the evil angels.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we were dead in trespasses and sins. But now we are redeemed and regenerated and have received the sonship to become the Body of Christ. This surely manifests the multifarious wisdom of God and is a great shame to His enemy, the devil.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH<br />
IN RELATION TO THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>1. THE CHURCH IS OUR LIVING</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Having put off the old man with his practices, and having put on the new man.&rdquo;</strong> Colossians 3:9-10a</p>
<p>The church is the house of God and also our home. To be regenerated is to be born into the family of God. For this reason we should put off our old manner of life and come into the church life.</p>
<p>2. THE CHURCH IS OUR PROTECTION</p>
<p>When the Bible speaks of the church life, it often uses the phrase <em>one another.</em> This life of mutual care is our protection.</p>
<p>We should not be individualistic Christians. We should give ourselves to the church.</p>
<p>One piece of burning coal can die out easily, but a pile of coals will not die out so easily.</p>
<p>One chopstick can be broken easily, but a bundle of chopsticks cannot be broken so easily.</p>

</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>1. THE NATURE OF THE CHURCH IS ONE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The church, which is His Body.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 1:22b-23</p>
<p>Since the church is the Body of Christ, she is the same as Christ in life and nature. Therefore, the church must be one in nature.</p>
<p>2. THE EXPRESSION OF THE CHURCH ON EARTH IS ALSO ONE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church.&rdquo;</strong>  Matthew 18:17</p>
<p>The church is not something abstract. It has a visible expression on the earth. When the disciples had a problem, they could tell it to the church.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;We who are many are one bread, one body.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Corinthians 10:17</p>
<p>From this we can see that our God is one, the nature of the church is one, and her expression on earth is also one.</p>
<p>3. GOD PRESERVES THE ONENESS THROUGH THE LOCAL ONENESS</p>
<p>(1) The New Testament mentions the church 111 times. From all the verses concerning the church, we can see one fact, that is, one locality, one church.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;What you see write in a book and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.&rdquo;</strong>  Revelation 1:11</p>
<p>The epistles to the seven cities were to the seven churches, which shows that there was only one church in one city.</p>
<p>To appoint elders in every church was to appoint elders in every city (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5).</p>
<p>(2) Locality is the unique factor for the church to be called the churches (Acts 8:1; 13:1; 1 Cor. 16:19a; 2 Cor. 8:1; Gal. 1:2; Rev. 1:4, 11).</p>
<p>(3) The expression of the church takes the locality as its boundary. It is neither larger nor smaller than a locality.</p>
<p>Man is limited by space. God&rsquo;s children should not be divided for any reason other than the factor of space.</p>
<p>The expression of the church is one, but believers are limited by localities. Hence, the oneness of the church becomes the local oneness.</p>
<p>4. AN UNSCRIPTURAL ERROR</p>
<p>Today we see many so-called &ldquo;churches.&rdquo; In a large city there may be ten or more so-called &ldquo;churches,&rdquo; every one of them with its own name. This is a great error. It breaks the testimony of the Body of Christ into pieces.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE TYPE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p><strong>(1) The Israelites were to worship at the place where God set His name</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come: and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings.&rdquo;</strong>  Deuteronomy 12:5-6a</p>
<p>God gave this revelation to Moses even before the Israelites entered Canaan.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Jerusalem was the place God had chosen to set His name there</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father.&rdquo;</strong> 2 Chronicles 3:1</p>
<p>God chose Jerusalem as the unique center of worship for the Israelites. The purpose of this was to preserve the oneness among His people.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Jeroboam set up another center of worship, thus causing the people of Israel to fall into sin</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Whereupon the king took counsel... and said unto them. It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem...O Israel...And he set the one [golden calf] in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Kings 12:28-30</p>
<p>For the purpose of securing his kingdom, Jeroboam set up another center of worship, so that the Israelites would not need to go to Jerusalem to worship, thus committing the sin of causing the Israelites to fall into sin. Therefore, we must not take any excuse for breaking the oneness among God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p><strong>(4) The Israelites were captured to Babylon; the temple of God was destroyed (2 Chron. 36:17-20)</strong></p>
<p>By this time the people of God were completely scattered and had lost the ground of oneness.</p>
<p><strong>(5) The return to Jerusalem to recover the lost oneness</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation...saying...Who is there among you of all his people?...Let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel...which is in Jerusalem.&rdquo;</strong> Ezra 1:1-3</p>
<p>Once again the children of Israel returned to God&rsquo;s chosen ground of oneness to rebuild the temple of God. This is a type of the church today.</p>
<p>Today we must avoid any factor of division and stand on the ground of the oneness of the church, preserving the oneness of the church and bearing the testimony of oneness.</p></body></html>
