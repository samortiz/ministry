   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR A CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I believe we have all been deeply impressed with these four words, Christ, house, city, earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us forget about the negative one, the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must always remember God's Christ, the house of God, the city of God, and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen clearly that the entire book of the Psalms just covers these main points in a wonderful sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have also seen that the picture given us by the book of Psalms is exactly the same as that portrayed by the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The whole Bible reveals only Christ, then the church, and then the reigning of Christ over the whole earth with the New Jerusalem as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CONCERNING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us consider now all the main aspects of Christ in the Psalms: His divinity Psalm 45:6; Heb 1:8 His incarnation Psalm 8:4; Heb 2:6 His humanity Psalm 8:4; Heb 2:6 His human living Psalm 16:1-8 His death Psalm 22:1-21 His resurrection Psalms 2:7; 16:10; 22:22; Heb 2:12; Acts 2:25-32; 13:35-37 His ascension Psalm 68:18; Eph 4:8 His exaltation Psalms 80:17; 110:1 His crowning Psalm 8:5; Heb 2:9 His enthronement Psalm 2:6 His dominion, kingship, and authority Psalms 2:8; 8:6; 47; 72; 89; 110 His priesthood Psalm 110:4 His fighting Psalms 110:5, 6; 45:3-5 His victory Psalm 110:5, 6 His indwelling Psalm 22:22 His shepherding Psalm 23 The stone for the building Psalm 118:22 His coming Psalms 72; 96; 110 His reigning Psalms 93 101</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The main Psalms concerning Christ: Psalms 2, 8, 16, 22, 23, 24, 45, 68, 80, 91, 110, 118</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These are just the main aspects; there are many details which could be filled in. It is clear that through the Psalms we can know Christ much better than through the New Testament.</S>
