<P>There are two meanings here. The first is that now is not the time for us to speak; this is the time for us to listen. This is not the time for us to say what is in Christianity; this is the time for us to listen. Hear Him. This means: "Peter, shut up. There is no place for you to speak. You should listen instead." The second meaning of this word is that even though there are Christ, Moses, and Elijah, we should hear only Him. We should not hear the others. We should hear only Him! Peter spoke of three persons, but heaven spoke of only one. Peter spoke of three names, but God recognized only one. In other words, Peter nominated three names, but God accepted only one.</P><P>Up to this point, it is still "all walls and no door." The law and the prophets are no more. Moses is gone, and Elijah is gone. Only Jesus remains. But what do Moses and Elijah represent? Moses represents the law and Elijah represents the prophets. But what are the law and the prophets? Let us spend some time to consider what the law and the prophets are. The brothers and sisters who have been meeting with us for some time may be quite familiar with these. But many others may not be familiar with their significance, and I should repeat it for their sake. What are the law and the prophets? What is Christ? The law, the prophets, and Christ are related to the foundation of Christianity, the foundation of the New Testament, and the foundation of the church. What is the law? It is a dead code of right and wrong that exists apart from God. It is dead moral standards that exist apart from God. This is the law. It is something that leads men away from God; it shows men what is right and what is wrong, apart from God. The law tells men what is right and what is wrong, without having anything to do with God. The law is a collection of regulations apart from God which tell man what he should do. What is the law? It is something that helps you distinguish right from wrong. When one knows the law, he does not have to go to God anymore.</P><P>Take, for example, the elementary school system we had in China twenty years ago. At that time, there were not as many elementary schools as there are now. We all spent some time in the private tutorial schools. In those schools, there was only one teacher with seven or eight students. There was absolutely no curriculum and very little printed material. There was no set hour for the school to begin and no set hour for it to end. There were no set rules to follow. The teacher was at one end of the room, and the students sat facing him. School did not begin at seven or eight o'clock, but whenever the teacher arrived. School was not dismissed at one, three, or four o'clock in the afternoon, but whenever the teacher left. The rules were with the teacher. If you arrived after the teacher, you were considered late. If you left when the teacher was still there, you were considered as having left before the scheduled time. The teacher was the rule. What was right and what was wrong? Whatever the teacher liked was right, and whatever he did not like was wrong. There was no rule that said: number one, we should do this; number two, we should do this; number three, we should do that; and number four, we should do that. Whatever the teacher liked was done. Whatever the teacher did not like was not done. A holiday was not a day of a festival or a set date; when the teacher did not show up, it was a holiday. Everything hinged on one man. His likes and dislikes were the standard of morality, his conduct was the yardstick of approval, and his movement was the gauge of time. While we studied the classic books, our eyes had to be set on him. If we did not set our eyes on him or if he was not there, there was no rule, and we would not know what to do and not do. We had to be related to him day after day. Whatever he liked was the norm. If he wanted you to come, you had to come. If he wanted you to go, you had to go. You had to be related to him. Now schools are different. There are school rules, laid out in thirty or fifty items. If the principal of a school has a detailed mind, he may lay down even a hundred rules. There is a set time for the school to begin and a set time for the school to dismiss. There are certain books that one has to read, certain uniforms that one has to wear, and certain clothes that one cannot wear. There are certain things that one can do and certain things that one cannot do. Those who set the rules, whether the principal or the directors, are the lawmakers. You may never see them in your life and still be a good student. This is because the rules are on the walls and in the books. If you are properly related to the rules on the walls and in the books, that is good enough. You do not have to be related to the teachers, the principal, the directors, or any of the lawmakers. As long as the rules and the laws are in your hand, you can take the teachers away. As long as you abide by the rules, you are a good student.</P><P>This is the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament is like our present-day schools. God laid down a few rules. In the Old Testament, men did not need to draw near to God. In the Old Testament, as long as men kept the laws, and as long as they knew what they ought to do and what they ought not to do, they could be a good disciple of Judaism. They could become righteous without coming to God. Zachariah was a very righteous man in the Old Testament, or at least we can say that he was a very good disciple of Judaism. In today's term, he would be considered a good "Christian." But a man as righteous as Zachariah did not receive any answer to his prayers. According to the law he was a righteous man. According to the ordinances, he was a perfect man. But he did not know God Himself; he did not know God's face. What then is the law? It is regulations which exist apart from God. It is moral standards which exist apart from God. It is standards of right and wrong which exist apart from God. The law is anything which exists apart from God. Anything which exists apart from God is the law. Regulations which are apart from God are the law. Hence, in the Old Testament, men did not have to come before God or be related to God. Throughout their lifetime they just abided by the dead laws.</P><P>What is the New Testament? The New Testament is a return to the private tutorial school. We have a perfect Teacher. The failure of the traditional private tutorial school was not that the system was bad, but that the teachers were not qualified. If a sage would come and be the teacher, that school would be better than the present-day schools. What is the New Testament? The New Testament takes away the law and allows Christ to be the Master; the law is no longer the master. Today we do not go to the Bible to find out what is right and what is wrong. Today it is a matter of the Son of God being glorified. God's Son is glorified not only on the heavenly throne, but in our hearts as well. On the Mount of Transfiguration, He received honor and glory. Peter said that he beheld the honor and glory of the Lord Jesus with his eyes (2 Pet. 1:16-17). God has bestowed honor and glory on the Lord Jesus. Today should there be one tent, two tents, or three tents? Tents are man-made. In other words the tents are our hearts. On the throne in heaven, there is only Christ. But are there three places in our hearts, one for Moses, one for Elijah, and one for Christ? Or is there only a place for Christ? God's requirement is that we receive Christ. But within us, not only do we have Christ, we also have outward things such as the law and the prophets. (We will speak on the prophets in a minute.) The guidance we receive today should come from the indwelling Christ, and not from any outward dead regulations or lifeless laws. I do not despise the Bible. Some of you have been meeting with us for many years; you know that we pay much attention to this Book. But I say that we can even make this Book a book of regulations and laws. Today I dare not say and I will not say that the Bible does not contain regulations and laws. I am saying that it does not contain just regulations and laws. The question today is not what the Bible says, but what Christ within us says. The question today is not what the law written by Christ says, but what the Christ within us says. This is the difference between living in the New Testament age and the Old Testament age. In the Old Testament age, one looked up the Scripture and tried to find out what the laws said. The New Testament age is different. Besides the Bible, what is the Lord Jesus saying within us? If we care only for outward things, God will interrupt our speaking. The question today is whether or not we have something within us.</P>
