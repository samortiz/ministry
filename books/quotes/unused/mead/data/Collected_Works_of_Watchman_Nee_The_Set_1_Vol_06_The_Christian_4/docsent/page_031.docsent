   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Third Way to Hell:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Pride</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us now read a few verses of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Luke 18:14, the Lord Jesus tells us about the end of a Pharisee and a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Pharisee was a very moral man; he was very zealous for religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The tax collector was a very immoral person and had no desire for the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this chapter of the Scripture, the Lord Jesus says that both went up to the temple to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The good Pharisee was not willing to humble himself and confess that he was a sinner; he was not willing to ask for God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The evil tax collector knew that he had no righteousness to merit God's favor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He, therefore, confessed his sins, humbled himself before God, and prayed for God to propitiate his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this verse the Lord Jesus tells us the different endings of the two men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"I tell you, This man the tax collector went down to his house justified rather than that one the Pharisee ; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus tells us that the very moral Pharisee was not justified, while the very unlawful tax collector was justified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The meaning of justification is not only forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Forgiveness implies having sins but that such sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Justification, however, means that one is declared sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we see a man who thought that he had no sins but who was, nevertheless, condemned by God; and we also see a man who thought that he did have sins who was declared sinless by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why was such a moral Pharisee condemned?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And why was such an immoral tax collector justified?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no other reason than that "everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we make it more plain, the meaning of justification is to go to heaven and the meaning of not being justified is to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we see a proud person going to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who are proud will go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They will certainly go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, O proud ones, be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have three more verses that we have to read.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"The Lord will destroy the house of the proud" Prov 15:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord /...he shall not be unpunished" Prov 16:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Jehovah of hosts will have a day / Over everything proud and lofty, / And over everything lifted up that it may be abased" Isa 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These few verses tell us clearly that the proud will be judged; they will be judged on the day God judges men, and they will go to hell and suffer an eternal suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible mentions repeatedly that the proud will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, if you want to go to hell, please be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By being proud, you will have a way to reach your desired destination: hell!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is pride?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The meaning of pride is to uplift yourself and put yourself in a position that you have not attained.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Pride is to claim that you are more than you really are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus pointed this out clearly in Luke 18.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus said that the Pharisee was self-exalting and proud.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How was he self-exalting and proud?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His morals were indeed exemplary.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But he would not admit that he was a sinner before God and in His light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was reporting his merits to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He did not mention his weaknesses, failures, falls, and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He would not admit that he was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He tried to vindicate his righteousness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This then was his pride.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was proud because he was not willing to confess that he was a sinner, even though before God he was a sinner and not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the contrary, he hastily claimed that he was a righteous man before God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God did not interfere with his pride!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He allowed the Pharisee to justify himself!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God allowed him to become satisfied with himself; He did not argue with him!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But God did not justify him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, He let him perish and suffer in hell!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the real meaning of pride is to be unwilling to humble yourself before God, to confess that you are a sinner, and to receive the merit of the substitutional death and the shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Proud people perish, not because they are proud, but because their pride hinders them from being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Pride is but one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Jesus has died for all the sins of men.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has borne all the punishment for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Pride is but one of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This sin has been judged on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, if we do not remove pride, we will not believe in the Lord Jesus' death for us, and we will not receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Proud people perish because their pride hinders them from being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Unless a man confesses that he has sinned and stands on the position of a sinner, he will not receive the Lord Jesus as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am a preacher of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Until today, I have not seen a man who will not confess his own sins but who will believe in the substitutional death of the Lord, and who is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to be saved, one has to be humble and confess that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I remember one time I was preaching at a place.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I was preaching privately to a high school teacher one night.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He asked me many questions concerning Christianity and other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We had a discussion for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But his questions kept coming.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I then told him that none of his questions were the basic question.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is not necessary to solve many problems before a man can believe in the Lord Jesus as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I told him that one thing is the most crucial of all.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is the first qualification for believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is confessing that one is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you do not confess that you are a sinner, no matter how many answers you have received to difficult questions, you will not be helped to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you confess that you are a sinner and feel that you are in sin, bound by sin, and fear the punishment of sin, you will surely seek a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But this man was very unclear about sin; sometimes he confessed that he had sinned, and sometimes he did not feel that he had sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Later I told him, "If you do not know for sure that you are a sinner, you will not be able to understand the crucial doctrine of redemption in the Bible."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We talked until almost midnight and there was still no result.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the end I told him one word, "Please consider your own sins some more!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you do, many of your questions will be answered."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>After a few days, the man indeed realized his sins and believed in the unique sin-substituting Savior, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Please think more about your own sins now!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you will humble yourself to confess that you are a sinner, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If you remain proud and do not confess, your pride will send you to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, if you want to go to hell, you should willfully deceive yourselves; you can be willfully proud and can willfully refuse to admit that you are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You will go down to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In hell there is no need of humility!</S>
