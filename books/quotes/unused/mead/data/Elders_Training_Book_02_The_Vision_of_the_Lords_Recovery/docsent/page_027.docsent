   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTERS SIX THROUGH TWENTY OF REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapters six through twenty of Revelation are actually a parenthetical section because Revelation is a book on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The focus of the Bible is not the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The focus of the Bible is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first three chapters of Revelation are on the church, chapters four and five are on Christ, and the last two chapters are on the consummation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chapters six through twenty, though, are a section of God s governmental, universal administration to purify and clear up the entire universe by judging and eliminating all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The last enemy, death, will be dealt with along with Satan, who held it as might and who is cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After this, the entire universe is cleared up and becomes a new universe, a new heaven and a new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation six through twenty is, therefore, a section on God s universal government to deal with His enemy and all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Within this parenthetical section, the church and the saints are referred to seventeen times:</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 In 6:9-11 the martyred souls who are still under the altar cried to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The cry of the martyred souls constitutes the fifth seal in Revelation and ushers in the sixth seal, which is the initial step of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 In 7:9-17 is an innumerable multitude under the Lamb s overshadowing care.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While the judgment of all the calamities is taking place, Christ will overshadow His redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>3 In 8:3-5 Christ is the High Priest offering all the suffering saints prayer, with His incense added, to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s answer to this prayer is to judge the rebellious world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4 11:18 mentions the reward given to the Lord s slaves, the prophets, the saints, and those who fear His name.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This reward will be given by the Lord to His faithful ones at His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>5 In 12:1-17 is the universal woman with the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is the man-child that causes the great dragon to be cast down from the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>6 In 13:7 the beast, the Antichrist, was allowed to war with the saints and to overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>7 The firstfruit of the believers before the great tribulation, the one hundred and forty-four thousand, is in 14:1-5.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>8 In 14:13 are the martyred saints in the great tribulation and their blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>9 In 14:14-16 is the harvest of believers near the end of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>10 In 15:2-4 are the martyrs who had been under Antichrist s persecution standing upon the glassy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>11 During the tribulation there is a warning given to the remaining saints to keep their garments in 16:15.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>12 In 17:14 are those saints who were called and chosen and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were selected to be an army to fight Antichrist and the false prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>13 In 18:4 the Lord calls His children, Come out of her, My people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To come out of her means to come out of both religious Babylon and material Babylon since Babylon the Great is twofold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>14 In 19:7-9 is the Bride ready for Christ s wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>15 Revelation 19:14 mentions the heavenly armies composed of the overcomers who will be the ready Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>16 In 20:4 and 6 we see the co-kings of Christ in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>17 Then the camp of the saints surrounded by the rebellious nations instigated by Satan is in 20:9.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These seventeen instances of the church in this parenthetical section need much study.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would study these instances we would see something and have something new, solid, and basic to minister to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of study and ministry would encourage me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we would study these instances, we would understand much more concerning God s economy related to the church and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These seventeen instances are inserted into this parenthetical section.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During this time, God will be carrying out His universal, governmental administration.</S>
