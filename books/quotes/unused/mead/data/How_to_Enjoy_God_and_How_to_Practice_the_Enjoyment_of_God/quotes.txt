[1]  How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God CONTENTS
[2]  In these messages I have a burden to speak concerning the way to enjoy God.
[3]  We will spend some time to consider how a Christian can enjoy God.
[4]  Some may consider the thought of enjoying God to be unusual, but the Bible clearly says that we can taste God.
[5]  A sweet thought recorded in the Word of God is that God is not only near us but that He has even given Himself to us to be our enjoyment.
[6]  Although our God is invisible, untouchable, and intangible, those who have experienced God can testify that they enjoy Him in their spirit, their soul, and even their body.
[7]  The Bible says that God is a Husband to us.
[8]  As created and redeemed ones, we are a wife to God.
[9]  If we read through the entire Bible, we will see that the Bible begins and ends with life.
[10]  The Bible speaks of another kind of relationship between God and man.
[11]  Every believer is a habitation of God, a temple of God, a house of God.
[12]  God dwells within us, and He allows us to dwell in Him.
[13]  God wants to be our life, our Husband, our food, our drink, our habitation, our light, our strength, our love, our joy, our comfort, our healing, and our guidance.
[14]  Regrettably, Christians today are full of common, religious concepts about God.
[15]  They realize that there is a sovereign Lord in this universe who is great, holy, and bright.
[16]  If we understand the Bible, our eyes will be opened to see that this great, holy, bright, and sovereign Lord has humbled Himself to meet with small, lowly, filthy, and sinful men such as we.
[17]  Even though He is our Redeemer on the cross and the Lord of all on the throne, He has condescended and lowered Himself to be as small and lowly as we are so that we can receive Him.
[18]  CHAPTER TWO GOD DESIRING MAN TO ENJOY HIM Scripture Reading: 1 John 4:13, 16; John 15:5 GOD S DESIRE BEING FOR MAN TO ENJOY HIM
[19]  In the Bible there is a very important principle related to the first mention of a matter that sets an eternal governing principle for that matter throughout the rest of the Bible.
[20]  After God created man, He placed him in front of the tree of life so that man would enjoy the fruit of that tree.
[21]  God s first thought after creating man was for man to eat and drink, and the object of this eating and drinking was God Himself.
[22]  We often think of how we should worship and serve God and of how we should do this or that for God, and it never occurs to us that the Lord Jesus does not care about this.
[23]  Although the branches of a fruit-bearing tree may bear much fruit, none of the fruit is the result of the work of the branches.
[24]  If we say to the branches, You have worked too hard, they will respond, This is not true; we are simply bearing fruit.
[25]  When we meet a child of God, we may feel that he is a pious, God-fearing man who seeks God.
[26]  Even we are not clear; we are novices in knowing God, enjoying Him, touching Him, and fellowshipping with Him.
[27]  When I began serving the Lord, the most difficult thing for me to do was to minister the word.
[28]  Regrettably, most of our prayers are not prayers in which we absorb God; instead, they are religious prayers.
[29]  We may pray, O God, I am going to preach the gospel today.
[30]  Such prayers are useless because they do not touch God, contact Him, or absorb Him.
[31]  God does not intend for us to do anything for Him.
[32]  The secret of the Christian life is not how much we work for Him, but how much we enjoy Him.
[33]  It is not what we do for Him, but how we enjoy Him.
[34]  The Bible unveils that throughout the ages God has been doing one thing in man: He has been mingling Himself with man.
[35]  The human concept is that God wants man to worship and serve Him.
[36]  The Bible, however, shows that God does not require such things from us.
[37]  Brothers and sisters, we must realize that unless God is mingled with us in our worship and service, they are not worth anything before God.
[38]  God s children need to see this basic issue: God does not desire worship or service from man; neither does He desire to do things for man or man to do things for Him.
[39]  Let us now consider the way to enjoy God.
[40]  In order for us to enjoy God and receive Him as the constituent of our inner being, He has taken four steps.
[41]  When a man is very rich, he thinks about worshipping God, and when a man is in pain or dire conditions, he also thinks about worshipping God, because when he is rich or in pain, he discovers that he has a need in his spirit.
[42]  When he opens to God and fellowships with Him, he finds joy and satisfaction in his spirit, but when he does not open to God or fellowship with Him in his spirit, he feels that something is missing or lacking, and he is unhappy.
[43]  If we would spend some time every day to pray before the Lord, that is, to stop our mind, exercise our spirit, and fellowship with Him by contacting Him, absorbing Him, and opening ourselves to be filled with Him, we will experience unspeakable satisfaction, freshness, and relief.
[44]  When we would spend a little time to be with God every day, when we stop our thoughts and exercise our spirit to fellowship with Him, absorb Him, and be filled with Him, we sense indescribable sweetness, freshness, freedom, and satisfaction.
[45]  In the second step God Himself became a man at the appointed time.
[46]  When the Lord Jesus came to the earth, God was fully mingled with man.
[47]  He was truly a man, and every part within Him was God.
[48]  The difference between the Lord Jesus and us is that every part within us is man, but every part within Him was God.
[49]  In order for God to become our enjoyment, He not only created us with a spirit to receive Him, but at the appointed time He also came into man to be fully mingled with man, thus becoming man s Savior.
[50]  In other words, His blood dealt with every barrier between God and us; He dealt with everything that frustrates us from contacting God or from touching Him, and everything that disqualifies us from standing boldly before Him.
[51]  The Epistle of 1 John, a book on fellowship between man and God, begins by saying that God s life has entered into man and enables man to fellowship with God.
[52]  However, after the Lord Jesus resurrection, the mingling of God and man was complete; God had entered into man, and man had entered into God.
[53]  In the previous chapter we considered the four steps God took to become our enjoyment.
[54]  Our spirit is the organ for us to receive God.
[55]  They include God s entrance into man, the death of the cross, resurrection, and man s entrance into God.
[56]  Today when a person receives the Spirit, the functions of all the elements contained in the Spirit, such as God s mingling with man, man s mingling with God, the cleansing of sins, and the termination of the self are activated.
[57]  Even though God is a substance, and our spirit is a substance, as long as we exercise our mind instead of exercising our spirit, we will be unable to substantiate God.
[58]  In order to understand how God s manifestation is related to contacting Him, we must clearly see the principle that God s will and fundamental desire is for us to provide Him with opportunities to mingle Himself with us.
[59]  The third step in enjoying God is to trust in the blood and the death of the cross.
[60]  When we come to God, exercise our spirit, and learn to cooperate and be mingled with Him, we will discover that we have two problems.
[61]  Our lack of feeling that we are sinful and lack of realization that we are a problem are strong proofs that we have not touched God sufficiently; we are not living according to His countenance.
[62]  Whenever we touch God and live in His countenance, we will see that we are dirty and full of sins.
[63]  Whenever we touch our spirit, and whenever we touch God and sense His presence and mingling, we will realize that we are unclean.
[64]  I can testify that the more one touches God s presence and His countenance, and the more one mingles with God and cooperates with Him, the more he feels a need for the cleansing of the blood.
[65]  In this chapter and the next we will consider how we can enjoy God through prayer and reading the Word.
[66]  Prayer and reading the Word are the most crucial means to receive and enjoy God.
[67]  When we pray, we should not have a motive or intention of asking God to do something for us; rather, our intention should be to breathe in God and absorb Him.
[68]  In order to breathe in God through prayer, we must appear before God.
[69]  His soul pants for God as the hart pants for the streams of water.
[70]  When we turn to exercise our spirit, we immediately touch God and appear before Him in our spirit.
[71]  In order to have prayers that breathe in God, we first need to turn to our spirit to touch God.
[72]  When we come before God in prayer, we must learn to stop our speaking, to cut off our words, and to simply turn to our spirit to appear before Him, touch Him, behold Him in silence, and gaze upon Him.
[73]  Many times when God asks us to do something for Him, He does not force us.
[74]  When we pray, we need to inquire of God, and we also need to wait on God.
[75]  We must learn that when breathing in God through prayer, we should not only inquire of Him and wait on Him but also meditate on Him and ponder His acts.
[76]  As we touch Him, remain in Him, behold His loveliness, converse with Him, inquire of Him, wait on Him, and muse upon Him, we should worship Him.
[77]  As we remain in God, muse upon Him, worship Him, and praise Him, He reveals His desire to us, and we intercede by inquiring.
[78]  In this chapter we will consider how to enjoy Him in reading the Word.
[79]  In other words, we want to see how we should study the Bible.
[80]  Since this is a broad subject, we will focus only on how to absorb God through reading the Word.
[81]  Although many people pray, they do not contact God, and although many people study the Word, they do not absorb God.
[82]  In the last chapter we pointed out that prayer is not asking God to do many things, but it is breathing in God.
[83]  Although the Bible is full of teachings, and it is difficult to find another book that contains as many teachings as the Bible, when we seek God through the Word, we should realize that the Bible is not merely a book of teachings.
[84]  When we contact the Word, we need to be clear that we are contacting God Himself.
[85]  Whenever we open the Bible, our first thought should be to contact the living God.
[86]  Every word of the Bible, from the first to the last, is the breath of God.
[87]  Unless we have the concept that we are coming to God and contacting Him, our focus will be wrong.
[88]  The first thought we should have, the first step we should take, when we open the Scriptures is to prepare ourselves to contact God.
[89]  As we leave for work in the morning, we still may be saying, In the beginning God...In the beginning God...God created...God created...Praise You.
[90]  God s children need to see that whenever we come to His Word, we should be convicted in our heart that this Word is the speaking forth of the living God.
[91]  Whenever we read God s Word, if we acknowledge that it is His very speaking and contact it with our spirit, our inner being will touch God and receive Him.
[92]  It is impossible for us not to receive any understanding when we contact the Bible.
[93]  However, if we touch God and contact Him through this word, it will turn us to meditate and pray so that we can absorb God and receive Him and His element within us.
[94]  In this chapter we will continue the matter of enjoying God.
[95]  I want to emphasize that God is man s enjoyment.
[96]  After God created man, He did not say to man, I am the Creator.
[97]  Worship Me, serve Me, and work for Me. God did not do this.
[98]  If we were Adam and Eve before the Creator, we would probably respectfully confess: Let us worship our Creator, serve Him, stand before Him, and wait for His command.
[99]  Whenever we breathe deeply, we first must breathe out and then breathe in. The more we breathe out, the more we can breathe in. We do not need to pray that much, nor do we need to spend that much time to worship or serve God.
[100]  In effect, God was indicating that there was no need to serve and worship Him, but rather to be fed and satisfied with Him.
[101]  If the Bible speaks of love, it is a love that is lived out through our eating of God.
[102]  If the Bible speaks of patience, it is a patience that is lived out through our receiving of God.
[103]  If the Bible speaks of holiness, it is a holiness that is manifested through our digestion of God.
[104]  If the Bible speaks of zeal, it is a zeal that comes from the fire that burns within us through our breathing of the fiery God.
[105]  THE FOCUS OF GOD S SALVATION Scripture Reading: Exo 12:3-4; 16:14-15; 17:5-6; 1 Cor 5:7; 10:3-4; 1:2; 1 Pet 2:2-3; John 6:54-57; Matt 22:1-2; Luke 15:18, 21; Acts 2:4; Eph 5:18 THE LORD S DESIRE BEING FOR US TO LIVE HIM THROUGH EATING AND DRINKING HIM
[106]  In the previous chapter we emphasized that God wants man to enjoy Him through eating and drinking Him.
[107]  Although some may think that this is a crude and unrefined way of speaking, the New Testament speaks of God offering Himself to us for our food and drink.
[108]  Although the expression eating and drinking may seem common and even vulgar, God often uses common expressions to convey extremely mysterious things.
[109]  In describing the relationship between God and man, it is insufficient to say that man should receive God.
[110]  Even if we speak of receiving God into us, this may not convey the thought adequately, because receiving something into us does not necessarily mean digesting it into our being so that it becomes our very constitution.
[111]  The most direct and clear way is simply to say that God wants man to eat and drink Him.
[112]  Our concept is to worship God, serve Him, be zealous for Him, and do something for Him.
[113]  When we first hear the expressions eating God and drinking God, we may consider them as hard sayings that are difficult to understand.
[114]  As the living Father abides in Him, and He lives because of the Father, in the same way those who eat Him will live because of Him v. 57 . We live because of Him when we eat Him, because after eating Him, He enters into us and is digested by us.
[115]  The Lord Being Our Savior by Entering into Us through Eating and Drinking
[116]  We always say that the Lord Jesus is our Savior.
[117]  But when I say that we should not do anything, not try anything, and not consider anything, it is difficult to accept these words because we are short of the concept of eating and drinking God.
[118]  THROUGH TAKING IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Psa 27:1; John 6:63; 7:37-39; 14:6; 15:4-5; 1 John 2:27-28; 3:24; 4:13; 5:20 BEING DRUNK WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT
[119]  After speaking concerning eating Him in 6:57, the Lord said that anyone who thirsts should come to Him to drink in 7:37.
[120]  Those who came to the Lord Jesus when He was on earth thought that He was a teacher, a rabbi, and that He came to teach men how to behave.
[121]  However, the Lord Jesus showed them again and again that He did not come to teach men.
[122]  The clearest passage is in John 6 where the Lord said to the crowd around Him that His flesh is true food and His blood is true drink, that those who eat His flesh and drink His blood have eternal life, and that those who eat Him will live by Him.
[123]  When the Lord Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman, He said that the proper worship is neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem, but that God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit.
[124]  The more we are in the spirit, the more we will touch God, and the more we will absorb Him, eat Him, and drink of Him.
[125]  If we learn to assimilate God in our spirit, we will experience Him as everything, and He will be whatever we need.
[126]  As we assimilate Him this way, we will discover that God is our comfort when we need comfort.
[127]  We do not need to worry whether our speaking is eloquent or persuasive if we are filled and satisfied with God before we speak and if we continue to breathe Him in while we speak.
[128]  IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Col 2:9; John 14:16-20; 16:7-8; 1 John 2:27; 3:24; 4:13; 5:20; Rev 4:5; 5:6 THE NEED TO BE IN SPIRIT
[129]  We will continue to consider the way to contact God.
[130]  Both His incarnation, which joined God with man, and His death and resurrection, which brought man into God to be united with Him, are realized in the Spirit.
[131]  Our contact with man requires that we be sincere and truthful, but our contact with God requires that we turn to our spirit.
[132]  In summary, because God, who is Spirit, has entered into our spirit, we need to turn to our spirit and contact Him with our spirit.
[133]  We need to repeatedly remind the brothers and sisters that in order to contact God, touch Him, eat Him, drink Him, and enjoy Him, we need to be clear concerning these four points.
[134]  Whether or not a person can touch God depends altogether on learning the lesson of turning to our spirit and touching God with our spirit.
[135]  Learning the lesson of turning to our spirit is a secret that enables us to touch God, making it easy for us to absorb and enjoy God.
[136]  One day Jesus told His disciples that He was going to die.
[137]  He had been with them for only a short time, and they had only recently come to know Him as the Christ, the Son of God, the very embodiment of God Himself.
[138]  Let us now consider a person who absorbs the Spirit, that is, a person who enjoys God.
[139]  We have a certain feeling when we breathe fresh air; we have a feeling of enjoyment.
[140]  Similarly, whenever we touch the Spirit by breathing Him in, we have a certain feeling.
[141]  We are convicted; we feel judged and condemn ourselves because the Spirit is the lamps of fire burning before the throne of God Rev 4:5 .
[142]  Let us consider further the way to enjoy God by eating and drinking Him, that is, by breathing in God.
[143]  I bear a heavy burden and feel that it is very difficult to speak concerning how to eat and drink God.
[144]  The more we imitate, the less we will eat God, and the less we will touch Him.
[145]  However, if we are proper in absorbing God, all our problems will be solved, and we will be proper Christians who match God s standard.
[146]  The Lord Jesus, however, is the true bread which came down out of heaven; He is much higher than physical food.
[147]  When He enters into us, not only is He joined to us to become part of us as our constitution, nourishment, and supply, but He also becomes our very life.
[148]  It may be that God s life is conflicting with our life or that our life is conflicting with God s life.
[149]  CHAPTER TWELVE ENJOYING GOD BY PRAYING AT SET TIMES Scripture Reading: Psa 27:4; 84:4, 10; 55:17; 119:164; Dan 6:10; Acts 10:2-3, 9-11, 30; Gen 18:16-17, 22-23, 33 NEEDING A SET TIME OF PRAYER
[150]  God is Spirit, and the most appropriate way for us to absorb and enjoy Him is to turn to our spirit.
[151]  Turning to our spirit is as necessary as breathing in air.
[152]  Although God as the Spirit is available everywhere on earth, and although we can now receive Him anywhere and at any time, those who are experienced know that we need set times to devote ourselves to absorbing God.
[153]  If we want to touch Him in a deep way, and if we want to breathe out our sins and absorb God so that our entire being is renewed, we need a definite time to come to God.
[154]  How Saints of Old Set Aside Time to Pray
[155]  The secret to his being filled with God was in his setting aside three definite times a day to absorb God and to enjoy Him.
[156]  If we would spend some time before God, not to speak to Him and not to ask Him to do things for us but to give Him the opportunity to speak to us and to do things in us, many wonderful and mysterious things will happen to us during that time.
[157]  Even though there is no regulation concerning what we should do during this time of prayer, we should remember the points we considered in chapter 5.
[158]  During this time of absorbing God, we should not worry about so many things.
[159]  When we learn to come to God and behold Him in a quiet spirit, we will spontaneously worship and praise Him.
[160]  After worshipping and praising God, we must learn to inquire of God.
[161]  Rather, we should first have a discussion with Him, asking Him if we should pray for a certain matter.
[162]  BY READING THE WORD Scripture Reading: John 6:27-36, 41-43, 47-58, 60-61, 63, 66-68; 12:50; Matt 4:4; Jer 15:16; 2 Tim 3:16 READING THE WORD BEING ONE WAY TO ENJOY GOD
[163]  Since we desire to be persons who eat, drink, absorb, and breathe in God, we need a drastic change in our concept concerning the Bible.
[164]  We read the Bible with the purpose of eating, drinking, absorbing, and breathing in God, because we know that the Bible is the Word of God.
[165]  Since God wants to be our food, His expression and manifestation to man as the Word means that the Word is man s food.
[166]  Some people think that God s words are only precepts and commandments, but in John 12:50 the Lord Jesus said that God s commandment is eternal life.
[167]  When we do this, we are filled with God s supply and His presence as we love our wives.
[168]  But if our view changes, and we consider the Bible to be God s expression and His breathing out, the Bible will be a different book to us.
[169]  But when we read verse 21, which says, She will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins, we may understand that we are God s people, so He must save us from our sins.
[170]  BY MATCHING READING WITH PRAYING Scripture Reading: Psa 119:147-148; John 15:7; Dan 9:2-4; 2 Cor 3:6 READING AND PRAYING NEEDING TO BE COMBINED
[171]  This is the last chapter in the series concerning how to enjoy God.
[172]  Every person who enjoys and absorbs God knows from experience that prayer should accompany the reading of God s Word and that reading the Bible should accompany prayer.
[173]  This means that whenever we absorb God, we need to match our prayer with reading, and our reading with prayer.
[174]  He is the Word, and He became the Spirit so that we can contact Him, absorb Him, eat Him, drink Him, and enjoy Him.
[175]  For example, when we spend time with the Lord, whether in the morning or at any other time, we should have two kinds of Bibles.
[176]  We should have the Bible that is engraved on our heart and sealed by the Holy Spirit, and we should have a visible Bible that we hold in our hand.
[177]  It is preferable for the visible Bible to be a pocket-size version so that we can take it with us and read it wherever we may be.
[178]  In our reading we can mingle praying with reading; we can pray-read and read-pray the Bible.
[179]  When we are ready to enjoy God through prayer, we should be calm, call our entire being back to our spirit, and touch the Lord.
[180]  Some may think that we are the only ones supplied through such praying and reading, but this is not true.
[181]  As we read Romans 8:1 in this way, the Spirit may give us a feeling to pray for others.
[182]  When we receive this burden, we should respond by asking the Lord if the feeling to speak with the brothers and sisters is of Him and if He wants us to speak in the meeting.
[183]  Some people propose that we should read the Bible once a year by reading three chapters in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament every day.
[184]  We do not need to force ourselves to read four chapters every day.
[185]  Although the saints in the church in Taipei are willing to eat, drink, and enjoy God, they feel challenged because they do not know how to eat, drink, and enjoy God.
[186]  When we pray, we are breathing in God, and when we read, we are eating and drinking God.
[187]  Since the Bible is the word of God, and the Lord said that His words are Spirit, if we contact the Bible with our spirit, it becomes spirit, and we eat it.
[188]  It may seem difficult to exercise our spirit and not our mind when reading the Bible.
[189]  Some may understand this fellowship in theory, but they do not know how to practice it.
[190]  They may not know how to restrict their mind and exercise their spirit, allowing it to take the lead when they read the Bible.
[191]  A brother may be touched in his inner being and moved when he reads Romans 4:17, which says that God gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.
[192]  He might not understand much, but his spirit has eaten and enjoyed God because he has touched God.
[193]  If we do not practice this, we will not eat much God when we read the Bible; we will not receive much genuine supply in our spirit.
[194]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN LEARNING TO BE SIMPLE TO PICK UP
[195]  Strictly speaking, when we come to the Bible, we come to the presence of God to be fed by God.
[196]  When we come to the Bible, we also should not look for inspiration.
[197]  We should realize that reading the Bible is a simple matter, we should not come with a heart to study, we should drop our concepts, and we should not look for our own inspiration.
[198]  Instead of having the intention of investigating something in the Word, we should have a seeking heart to contact God Himself, to eat Him, drink Him, and enjoy Him through our reading.
[199]  The Lord replied saying, Blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me v. 6 . If our inner being is touched with the Lord s response, we may say to the Lord, Even though I have served You faithfully, and You do not seem to care for me in my sufferings and are doing many things for others who seem to have nothing to do with You, I am not stumbled by You.
[200]  When I come to the Bible, I have learned to ask myself whether I am coming with my concepts or whether I am setting them aside.
[201]  Let me repeat: it is difficult to find a child of God who receives the Bible as the pure, unadulterated Word of God.
[202]  Many brothers and sisters may still not be clear concerning studying the Bible in the way of life.
[203]  In this message we will consider again the matter of enjoying God through reading the Word.
[204]  All properly trained students of the Bible would agree that the tree of life symbolizes God revealing and presenting Himself to man as life in the form of food so that man would eat Him, thus enabling Him to become life to man.
[205]  A second category of things in the Bible is related to morality.
[206]  When God enters into man to be His life, He cannot allow man to remain an evil person.
[207]  In the same way, when God wants to make us His vessel, to enter into us as life, He must first cleanse our vessel from sin and evil.
[208]  From the above examples we can see that a person who comes to the Word can find words of comfort for times of trial, words that build up human virtues, words on the secrets to human living, and words on religious zeal.
[209]  However it is not easy for a person to find the central matters concerning God coming into man to become man s life.
[210]  Man must be in God before he can have true joy, before God s peace can truly guard his heart and mind, before he can have the secret to human living, and before he can do all things and experience Him as his strength in all things.
[211]  The words in Him are central and are related to God becoming life to man in the Son.
[212]  CHAPTER NINETEEN EXERCISING TO PRAY IN THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Jude 20 THE NECESSITY OF PRAYING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
[213]  In this message we will practice praying with Jude 20.
[214]  Although we cannot see the Spirit of God with our eyes or feel Him with our hands, we can clearly sense Him when He touches us within.
[215]  Our prayers bring us God s presence when we pray in the Spirit.
[216]  However, when we pray in the Spirit, we feel that the more we pray, the more we touch God and our words touch God.
[217]  If we are able to restrict ourselves and turn to the Spirit in this way, we should not immediately open our mouths to pray.
[218]  In chapter 5 we considered ten points we should pay attention to when we pray.
[219]  When we are busy with many outward things, there is no way for us to touch God.
[220]  As soon as we touch God in our spirit, we feel solid within; we feel that we have the anointing and the moving of the Holy Spirit.
[221]  ACCORDING TO THE SENSE OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:26
[222]  Such prayers are the issue of the Spirit of God being mingled with man s spirit and of man s spirit being mingled with the Spirit of God.
[223]  When a man exercises his spirit to pray, he is praying with his spirit in God s Spirit, or we can say that God s Spirit is praying in his spirit.
[224]  All those who truly know the meaning of prayer know that prayer is not merely a matter of God being mingled with man but a matter of God initiating something within man.
[225]  Since the presence of God and our mingling with Him are absolutely related to the sense in our spirit, we should learn to allow our inner sense to be the initiating and motivating element within us when we pray.
[226]  THE PRINCIPLE OF ENJOYING GOD THROUGH PRAYER BEING TO FOLLOW THE SENSE OF THE SPIRIT
[227]  Regrettably, many brothers and sisters are ignorant of these inward experiences.
[228]  Although they long for prayer that enjoys God and occasionally have enjoyable experiences, they do not know the key to prayer and are ignorant of the principle that governs prayer.
[229]  Therefore, they are never sure when they touch God.
[230]  Sometimes they touch God accidentally, but they do not realize that they have enjoyed God.
[231]  All experienced believers know that we absorb God in such prayers, and we are brought into God; God fills our being, and we are saturated with Him.
[232]  BEHOLDING, WAITING, AND MUSING Scripture Reading: John 15:7; Eph 6:18-20; Ezek.
[233]  Many know what it means to wait on God and muse upon Him, but few have truly learned to wait on God and muse on Him.
[234]  It is easy for believers who live in their spirit, who have dropped their concepts, and who have God s mind to touch God s heart concerning the church, to understand His care for His children and His expectation of His servants.
[235]  If we want to learn the work of intercession, we must learn to turn to our spirit, enter into God, drop our concepts, and care for God s heart.
[236]  Most people understand beholding the Lord to mean looking up at a God who sits far above in the heavens and who sends His light down to men.
[237]  According to our spiritual experience, however, this is not the meaning of beholding God.
[238]  Beholding God is to gaze and look at God.
[239]  If we do not turn to God or do not fix our gaze on Him but instead hastily utter a few words, it will be difficult for us to enjoy God.
