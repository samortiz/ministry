   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Expressing the Lord s Divine Attributes</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>His divine attributes were expressed in the cleansing of the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is impossible for any human being to cleanse a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, the One who cleansed this leper must be God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Lord s sympathy we see His human virtue, and in the cleansing of the leper we see His divine attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was the genuine God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As man He was filled with the human virtues, and as God He had the divine attributes that enabled Him to cleanse the man s leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this case the Lord s human virtues express His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the scriptural examples, leprosy comes from rebellion and disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Miriam became leprous because of her rebellion against God s deputy authority Num 12:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Naaman s leprosy was cleansed because of his obedience 2 Kings 5:1, 9-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All fallen human beings have become leprous in the sight of God because of their rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Man-Savior has come to save men from their rebellion and to cleanse them from their leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A leper, according to the law, was to be excluded from the people because of his uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one could touch him Lev 13:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Man-Savior touched the one full of leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What mercy and sympathy!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By His one touch, immediately the leprosy left him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A leper portrays a typical sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Leprosy is the most contaminating and damaging disease, isolating its victim both from God and men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To cleanse the leper signifies to recover the sinner to the fellowship with God and with men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is significant that the leper was not only healed but cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The one with leprosy not only requires healing as those with other diseases; he also needs cleansing, as from sin 1 John 1:7 , because of the filthy and contaminating nature of the disease.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>HEALING THE PARALYTIC</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the case of the healing of the paralytic 5:17-26 , we also see the Lord s divine attributes expressed in His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 5:20 He said to the paralytic, Man, your sins have been forgiven you!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the scribes and Pharisees heard this, they began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Who can forgive sins but God alone? v. 21 . The Lord Jesus exercised His divine authority to forgive the paralytic s sins and His divine power to heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in this case we also see the exercise of the Lord s kindness, which is a human virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, in this case also the Lord s human virtue expresses His divine attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Luke 5:24 says, In order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins He said to the paralyzed one, To you I say, rise and pick up your cot, and go to your home.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Man-Savior was the very God incarnated, not regarding equality with God a thing to be grasped.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was outwardly in the likeness and fashion of man, but inwardly He was God Phil 2:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was the Man-Savior and the God-Savior as well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, He had not only the ability to save sinners, but also the authority to forgive their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this incident, He forgave the paralytic s sins as God, but asserted that He was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that He was the true God and a real Man, possessing deity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Him, men can see both His divine attributes and His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CALLING THE DESPISED Matthew, a Despised Tax Collector</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 5:27-39 we have the case of the calling of a despised tax collector named Levi or Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 27 says, And after these things He went out and beheld a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, Follow Me. The tax office was a tollhouse, where Matthew collected taxes for the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Matthew was one of the tax collectors Matt 10:3 , probably in a high position, a man who was condemned, despised, and abhorred by the Jews Luke 18:11; Matt 5:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet he was called by the Man-Savior and was later chosen and appointed as one of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Luke 5:28 says of Matthew, And leaving all, he rose up and followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It seems that this was the first time the Lord met Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There must have been some attracting power with the Lord, either in His word or appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have pointed out that the Jewish people despised the tax collectors because they were collecting taxes for the Roman imperialists.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They were considered traitors, and the Jews were disgusted with them and despised them to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus came to one of these tax collectors and called him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With the calling of Matthew there was no miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the Lord Jesus came to Peter, He attracted him from his occupation by means of a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But He did not perform a miracle when He came to Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His willingness to come to Matthew was a great mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Jews stayed away from the tax collectors, regarding them as worse than lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, Matthew must have been surprised when the Lord Jesus came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Perhaps Matthew said to himself, Who am I that this One should come to me?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am a tax collector, a despised person.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Who would care for me?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet Jesus comes to me and tells me to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the Lord s calling of Matthew we see the high standard of His human virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps the Lord said to Himself when He was about to call Matthew, Yes, this one is a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But he is still a human being, and I will not reject him or give up on him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Rather, I shall come to him, contact him, and call him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I call not only the occupied ones, but also the despised ones.</S>
