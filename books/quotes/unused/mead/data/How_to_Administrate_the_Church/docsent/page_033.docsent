   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL S PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Paul s prayer, he asked that God would grant the Ephesian believers to be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His prayer was not an ordinary prayer; he described four aspects of this strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, he prayed that it would be according to the riches of His glory v. 16 . What is glory? Glory is the expression of the mystery, the content within God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible, glory refers to God being expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God expressed is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The children of Israel built the tabernacle at Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the tabernacle was erected, the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle, and the children of Israel saw glory Exo 40:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Solomon built the temple, and when the building was completed, the glory of Jehovah filled the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the children of Israel saw glory, they saw God 2 Chron 7:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ezekiel 1 and 10 show that God moved in the cherubim and walked through the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Ezekiel described what he saw, he did not speak of seeing God; instead, he spoke of seeing the glory of God 1:28; 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, glory is God expressed; God expressed is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since glory is God expressed, the riches of His glory must refer to the expression of the riches of God s life and nature, the riches of His excellent attributes, the riches of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All that is in the Godhead is rich, and the expression of the Godhead is full.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Colossians 2:9 speaks of all the fullness of the Godhead, which refers to the expression of God s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Godhead refers to what is within God, and God s glory refers to God s expression without.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The expression of the Godhead is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, electricity is the intrinsic matter within an electric lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The expression of the intrinsic nature of electricity in the light of the electric lamp is the glory of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we turn on the switch, the electricity in the lamp is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the outward expression of the Godhead is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Colossians shows that the inward content in the Godhead is the riches, and the glory that is expressed is the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Ephesians 3 Paul did not pray for the expression of the Godhead; rather, he prayed that God would grant the Ephesian believers to be strengthened into their inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The phrase according to the riches of His glory means that God wants to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, because He is restricted in the believers, He must strengthen them into their inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God does not want to remain only in Himself; He wants to be expressed, and glory is God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus is God, the expression of God, the effulgence of God s glory Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we speak of the glory of God, we are also speaking of the God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the riches in Ephesians 3:16 are the riches of the Godhead, and the glory as the expression of the riches of the Godhead is the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul asked God to grant the believers to be strengthened into their inner man according to the riches of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that he prayed that the riches of God s glory would enter into the believers so that they would be strengthened to an extent that others could sense God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The glory of the expressed God can enter into the believers and become the strengthening power within them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In turn, they are strengthened to express God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, if our strength does not express God s glory, it is not the strength that is spoken of here.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some brothers are very strong; however, their strength does not express God s glory but Adam s. In the same way, some sisters are very strong, but their strength shows the flesh and their being full of will and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of strength is not according to the riches of God but according to the riches of their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to pray, Lord, cause us not to be strong according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many brothers and sisters are strong in a way that shows people the riches of the flesh; on the other hand, some brothers and sisters are strong in a way that truly shows people the riches of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, Paul said, That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened...into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This strengthening is for the believers to express God s glory, that is, for God to express Himself in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This prayer is exceedingly great.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The second aspect of the strengthening of the Ephesian believers is through His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without the Spirit, God cannot be expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The third aspect is that the Ephesian believers would be strengthened with power into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that God s power enters into man and becomes a motivating power to strengthen man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fourth aspect is that they would be strengthened into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This strengthening is not a strengthening of the physical body but of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The purpose of this strengthening is that we may express God s glory, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 17 says, That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This result is brought about by the inner man being strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul did not speak of Christ earlier; he only spoke of glory and the Spirit, but the issue is Christ making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Throughout the entire New Testament, in speaking of Christ living in us, there is not another verse like Ephesians 3:17: Christ may make His home in your hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Galatians, for example, 4:19 says, Until Christ is formed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This refers to Christ s making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hearts in Ephesians 3:17 is an important word, meaning that Christ can be sensed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He not only dwells in us, but He dwells in our heart, which has feeling and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our heart is where our feeling and emotion lie.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The heart is the organ of our feeling and emotion, and it is where Christ dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The phrase may make His home in your hearts through faith means that when we first pursue God s glory for our strengthening, we may not sense that Christ dwells in us; therefore, we need to allow Christ to make His home in our hearts through faith.</S>
