   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ETERNAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today many people speak about eternal life through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But what is the eternal life which we receive?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While it refers to blessings in the future, what does eternal life mean for today?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ" John 17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eternal life in this age is the ability to know God and the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is very real.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Saying that everyone who believes in the Lord receives eternal life means that he receives an intuitive knowledge of God which he did not have before.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Eternal life through faith" is not a slogan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, it is something that can be proven in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who do not have this life the eternal life may infer things concerning God, but they do not have a personal knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only after one obtains this new life and has been regenerated, can he truly know God through his intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He may understand the Bible, yet his spirit still remains dead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He can familiarize himself with theology, yet he is not regenerated in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He may enthusiastically serve "in the name of the Lord;" however, there is no regeneration of a new life in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible tells us that man cannot find out God by searching Job 11:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything done through the mind cannot bring us to the knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Apart from man's spirit, man cannot know God; he cannot know God with his mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Bible we see only one kind of knowledge: the intuition in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE PROPER GUIDANCE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only should believers receive their initial knowledge through the spirit, they should continue in this way all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Christian life, other than the revelation one receives in his intuition, nothing else has any spiritual significance because none of the other things are of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since they are not of the spirit, they are not the will of God; God only reveals the things concerning His will to us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Anything that we think, prefer, and decide, apart from the revelation of the spirit, is dead in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A believer may act according to sudden thoughts, ideas that come after a prayer, a so-called burning in the heart, natural inclinations, strong reasons, or his logical judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are all just the activities of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's will is not known through such thoughts, feelings, or preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God only reveals His will in man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Anything not revealed through the spirit is self-activity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God never reveals His will to man's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Revelation is of the Holy Spirit and in man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man's spirit knows and receives God's will through the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After this, it transmits the will of God to the mind for its understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The mind is where we can understand God's will, yet it can never be the source of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's will originates from God and is revealed to man's spirit by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The spirit, in turn, causes the outward man to understand through the mind what the inward man already knows.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way, the outward man knows how to carry out God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a believer does not seek after God's will in his spirit, but exercises his mind all the time, he will be lost all the time and not know what to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our minds continually fluctuate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who walk according to their mind cannot, even for a moment, say from their heart, "I know with certainty that this is God's will."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only those who receive revelation in their spirit will have a deep confidence; only they will know and be fully assured of what they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's revelation in our spirit can be of two kinds: one is direct and the other is through searching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Direct revelation happens when God Himself has a will, and He charges the believers to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this case, He comes into the believers' spirit and reveals His will to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the believers receive this revelation in their intuition, they carry it out accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Revelation that comes through searching occurs when a believer has a need and does not know what to do; he comes before God and waits and seeks for His will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In answering the believer's searching, God operates in his spirit and reveals whether he should continue or stop.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a believer is young in his spiritual life, the revelation he receives is mostly of the searching kind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When he is more mature, he will have more direct revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, this is not absolute; I only mean that searching is more typical than direct revelation at first.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, this is where most young believers confront difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Time is needed for them to wait before the Lord and eliminate their self-thought, self-preferences, and self-opinions; nevertheless, they often forsake waiting for God's revelation and substitute their own will instead.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, they are often accused by their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even when they truly desire to follow God's will, they foolishly walk according to the thoughts in their mind because of a lack of spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Anything done without revelation will unavoidably lead to mistakes.</S>
