<h2 class="head1">THE WHOLE CHURCH ENGAGING<br />IN THE GOSPEL ENTERPRISE</h2><p>Zaccheus's story is in the first half of Luke 19. In the second half, we see God's kingdom being likened to a man of noble birth who charged his ten slaves to do business. In the first half of Luke 19, we find the money being stripped away. In the second half of the chapter we find the Lord putting the money back in our hand and charging us to do business. He did not give to one or two slaves, but to ten. Ten signifies perfection; it refers to all the slaves. In other words, the entire church is involved in the business of the Lord's gospel. The Lord used the parable of a man doing business to show us the kind of work the church is doing on earth today. The church is in the gospel enterprise business. We have only one kind of merchandise in this business&mdash;the gospel. The gospel is our goods. All ten slaves should be involved in this enterprise, and they should work in one accord. Some brothers may be in the fabric business. Others may be in the soap manufacturing business. In reality, however, everyone is in the same gospel business. God does not call ten unrelated merchants to do different "retail" gospel enterprises; He wants the whole church to be involved in one gospel enterprise. His heart is not for many retail businesses.</p><p>The Lord wants the whole church to be in His gospel business. Whoever does not join this work will be disciplined. As long as one among the ten has a different opinion or adopts a different way, he will receive the Lord's rebuke (Luke 19:20-26). There was something basically wrong with our work in the past. We claimed that we were serving as the Body, but in reality each one was taking his own way. Each person was doing what was right in his own eyes. We preached the gospel a little when we had the time. When our conscience bothered us, we preached a little to ease our conscience. We can no longer go on in this way. The whole Body has to give itself to the gospel enterprise.</p><p>In order to be involved in this gospel enterprise, on the negative side, we have to be free from our own little centers. In the past we were concerned only with our own job and our own living. Now we have to be delivered from this realm. Moreover, we have to hand over everything that we have because where our treasure is, there is our heart as well. If we say that our heart is in heaven but our treasure remains on earth, then we should say to the Lord, "Your Word is not trustworthy!" Is our heart or the Lord's Word more trustworthy? Our treasure must first go to heaven before our heart can be there. The Lord said that no man can serve two masters. The Lord wants us to be free from our material possessions because He wants our hearts to be truly in heaven on the one hand, and He wants us to invest the treasure that we have offered up in the gospel enterprise on the other hand. If we do not put in our share of the investment, the gospel enterprise cannot take off. If we are only concerned about our own investment, our own mammon, while allowing the gospel enterprise to go unattended, the gospel will never spread out over the earth. For every business there must first be the investment. From the first day that we are saved, we have to flee from money and forsake everything for the gospel. On the positive side, we have to offer up our very person. The forsaking of everything is not a deep lesson; it is a make-up lesson. As soon as a man is saved, he should offer up himself (Rom. 6:6, 12-14). In the past we did not have a good consecration. This is the reason we have to make up now. Handing over oneself is offering up one's very person, to be followed by his job and all his possessions. Whether we are a student or an office worker, we have to offer up our occupation and put it at the gospel's disposal. Some brothers and sisters have to change their occupation. In the past they were for their own living. Now they have to be for the gospel. Their occupation is no longer their top priority. The gospel should not rank behind other occupations in importance. Rather, secular occupations should be behind the gospel in importance. Perhaps some brothers and sisters should change their occupation.</p><p>In the coming days all the brothers and sisters have to lay their future aside. They should coordinate together. Even where we live should be decided by the gospel; we should not choose a city simply because we want to escape from war. Some moved to Hong Kong for the sake of escape, but we are here for the gospel. In Acts 8 the disciples preached the gospel while they were running away from the persecution. Escape was the secondary issue. We have over two hundred brothers and sisters who have migrated to Yi-Yang. Outwardly, they can give many reasons for going. Actually, everything they do is secondary. These brothers and sisters banded themselves together into one community only for the purpose of spreading the gospel.</p><p>One must be this kind of Christian before he can live a happy life. The most unhappy person is one who is neither hot nor cold. He cannot love the world, but he finds it difficult to give up the world. He knows he should not remain a weak Christian, and he feels condemned when he takes a step toward the world. The Lord calls such a Christian salt that has lost its taste (Matt. 5:13). Today we can say that we are starting a shareholding company or a cooperative. Everyone has handed over his money to the company, and everyone is engaged in the production of the company. From now on, we will no longer seek the world, fame, or our own profession. We are here only for the gospel enterprise. Ten or twenty years from now, when worldly goods become worthless, our business will be booming. When the entire church rises up to preach the gospel, the Lord's coming will be near; He will be at the door. If we cannot do this, we will delay the Lord's coming for a long time. Hence, when we hand ourselves over, we are not handing over just our money, but our occupation, our dwelling, our time, and our future. We will do everything that is beneficial to the gospel.</p>
