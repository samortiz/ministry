   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN ACTS Scripture Reading: Acts 1:5, 8; 6:3; 7:55; 9:4-5; 11:24; 13:52; 16:6-7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen something of the indwelling Christ in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we must come to the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may think that this is a book of the preaching of the early Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, it is just a record showing us how the early disciples were those who were baptized into the Triune God, and within whom the Triune God was living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Gospel of Matthew we are told that all the disciples are to be baptized into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the Gospel of John tells us that this Triune God is today the life-giving Spirit to dwell within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are abiding in Him, and He is abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now in the book of Acts we see that all the early disciples were those who were put into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the beginning of Acts, they were all baptized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were put into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Following this, we see that the Triune God was living within them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times in the book of Acts we read that they were full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This simply means that these disciples were people within whom the Triune God was living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Triune God was filling them and living within them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this we clearly see that in the book of Acts the early disciples were baptized into the Triune God, and on the other hand the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit was living within them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A CERTAIN KIND OF PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was by this that they became a certain kind of people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were people who had God Himself mingling with them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We know that we need to preach the Gospel and reach the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet we should not do this in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must be a kind of people who are put into the Triune God and who are filled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On one hand, we must be in the Triune God, and on the other hand, we need to have the life-giving Spirit living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the kind of people the early disciples were.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be full of the Holy Spirit means to be in the condition of being continually filled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the daily situation, the daily walk, and the daily condition of the early disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At this time, the Holy Spirit is the full realization of the Triune God, the real embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are full of the Holy Spirit, it means that we are filled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why the Lord Jesus did not tell them that they were to be preachers, but witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They were not preachers, but witnesses, because they were in the Triune God, and the Triune God was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They and the Triune God were one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, the indwelling of Jesus was their daily living; so in such a condition they were full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>FULL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many Christians today have been confused and complicated concerning the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be full of the Holy Spirit, they feel, is rather difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But it isn t that hard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is as simple as breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I was once asked, How can we abide in Christ, and Christ abide in us?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I answered by using the air as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the time we are in the air, and the air is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And today the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit is just like the heavenly air.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are in Him and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us clearly that God has put us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be in Christ is something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has put us into Christ, and God also has made Christ the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be full of the Spirit is not such a difficult thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As long as we open ourselves and confess all our sins so that there is no offense in our conscience, we can be full of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we confess and apply the blood to all our sinfulness, we are in Christ and Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not be complicated by so many kinds of teachings about the so-called baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the record of the Bible, to be filled with the Spirit is really as simple as breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jesus is not far from us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, He is very nigh unto us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We know that He is indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is waiting within us that we may open up to Him and give Him the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As much ground as we will give to Him, He will fill.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We only need to open ourselves to Him and make a thorough confession of anything that is sinful or condemned in His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we must apply His redeeming and cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do this, and keep calling on His name, we are spontaneously in Him, and He will spontaneously fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we will be in the situation that is described by the book of Acts as being full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Suppose you are a Christian who loves the Lord, yet you would not be dealt with by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You have some sinful things in your life, yet you would not confess unto Him and apply His precious blood to cleanse you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If so, you are just insulated from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Electricity is a good illustration of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We apply the electrical power by engaging the right switch.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But if the electrical wire is insulated at the point of contact, there is no way to receive the electrical power.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is the same with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Just a little insulation will keep us from the heavenly power.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we would deal with all the insulation, we would get into the flow of the power.</S>
