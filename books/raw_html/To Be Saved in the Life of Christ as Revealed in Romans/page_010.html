	<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>TO BE SAVED BY THE LIVING OF THE CHURCH LIFE IN A LOCALITY AND BY THE CRUSHING OF SATAN UNDER OUR FEET</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 16:1-25; 14:1-3, 10, 12, 15, 17; 15:5, 7; Eph. 4:3; Eph. 6:12</h1><p>The book of Romans, a book on the full gospel of God, consummates in its last three chapters, chapters fourteen through sixteen, in a particular revelation of the practice of the local churches, after the unveiling of God’s full and complete salvation in chapters one through thirteen. This full and complete salvation is composed of two aspects: the objective aspect of redemption, including forgiveness, justification, and reconciliation; and the subjective saving, including reigning in life, dispositional sanctification by the indwelling Spirit, the freeing of the law of the Spirit of life, the dispensing of the Triune God into our tripartite being, the renewing of our mind issuing in the transformation of our soul, and being built up in the Body of Christ (these being the six items which we have covered in the preceding chapters), and the two succeeding items, conformation to the image of the Son of God and the redemption of our body (which we will cover in the last chapter). Having participated in the first six items of God’s saving in the life of Christ, we will be well enabled to live a proper church life in a definite locality as a local expression of the Body of Christ to be a local testimony of Christ according to God’s New Testament economy.<h2 class=head1>SAVED BY THE LIVING OF THE CHURCH LIFE IN A LOCALITY</h2><p>The book of Romans not only has a rich content regarding God’s complete salvation conveyed in His full gospel; it also has a definite goal, which is the practice of the church life. The experience of the first six aspects of being saved in the life of Christ, which we have seen in the first thirteen chapters of Romans, makes it possible to enter into the experience of the living of a proper church life in many localities. This is according to God’s desire as the good pleasure of His heart, which He arranged in eternity in His eternal economy (Eph. 3:9-11).<h2 class=head2>Saving Us from Our Self-view, Self-goal, and Divisions</h2><p>The living of the church life in a locality saves us from our self-view, self-goal, and divisions (Rom. 16:1-25). Each of us has his own view and goal. In the church life there should be only one view and one goal. Without a unique view and a unique goal, it is impossible to have the genuine church life. We will be divided because of our different views and goals. A number of saints may begin to meet in a certain locality. But if all the brothers and sisters have different goals and views, division will result. The living of the proper church life in a locality will save us from our different views and goals. Eventually, by being saved from our own views and goals, we are saved from division.<h2 class=head2>Living Locally and Fellowshipping Both Locally and Universally</h2><p>In the living of the church life in a locality, our living is local, but our fellowship should be both local and universal (Rom. 16:1, 16b, 22-23). We should fellowship not only with the brothers and sisters in our own locality, but also with the brothers and sisters in all the other localities. In this way our fellowship is universal. If I live in Yorba Linda, I should fellowship with all the churches in southern California. The church life is both local and universal. But it is universal to a greater extent than it is local. In the churches, we must exercise to have fellowship with Taipei, London, New York, Zurich, and all the churches around the globe.<h2 class=head2>Receiving All the Believers in Christ</h2><h2 class=head3>According to God’s Receiving</h2><p>In the living of the church life in a locality, we must receive all the believers according to God’s receiving (Rom. 14:1-3). We must be able to receive the genuine believers of all kinds: Pentecostal, fundamental, Seventh-Day Adventists, and all others. To have the church life we must be all-inclusive, receiving all the believers in Christ. This kind of receiving is according to God’s receiving. We must receive the genuine believers because God has received them. In order to have the Body life of Romans 12, we must practice the principles unveiled in Romans 14 and 15 concerning the receiving of the believers. We must be able to receive those who keep certain days and those who do not keep any days (14:5), those who eat only vegetables and those who eat meat (14:2).
