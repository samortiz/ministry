<h2 class="head4">i. Jehovah Blessing Israel<br />
with the Blessing of &ldquo;New Wine,&rdquo; and<br />
Israel Possessing His Mountain</h2>
<p>Jehovah will bless Israel with the blessing of new wine, and they will possess His mountain, Zion, in order to dwell, eat, drink, and rejoice there (65:8-10, 13-16). In the restoration there will be new wine that will cheer God and His people. Instead of working and laboring, Israel will eat, drink, and rejoice.</p>
<h2 class="head4">j. Rejoicing, Exulting, and Having Abundant Life</h2>
<p>A restoration will be brought in both to Israel and to all things (vv. 18-25). Jerusalem will be an exultation, and her people will rejoice. Even God Himself will exult in Jerusalem and rejoice in His people, and there will no longer be heard in her the voice of weeping and crying. &ldquo;There will no longer be in her / An infant who reaches the age of only a few days / Nor an old man who does not fill up his days; / For the lad will die at a hundred years of age, / And the sinner, being a hundred years of age, will be cursed&rdquo; (v. 20). In the restoration an infant will not die before reaching maturity, and one who dies at the age of a hundred will be regarded as a youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will build houses and inhabit them, / And they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. / They will not build and another inhabit; / They will not plant and another eat; / For like the days of a tree are the days of My people, / And My chosen ones will enjoy the work of their hands to the full&rdquo; (vv. 21-22). This indicates that in the restoration the unique work carried out by God&rsquo;s chosen people will be to sing, praise, worship, and rejoice. Calling on the Lord will be their occupation, and even before they call, He will answer (vv. 23-24).</p>
<p>Isaiah also prophesied, &ldquo;The wolf and the lamb will feed as one, / And the lion will eat straw like the ox, / And dust will be the serpent&rsquo;s food; / They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain, says Jehovah.&rdquo; (v. 25) The prophecies in this verse are similar to those in 11:6-9, which also speak of the restoration brought in through Christ. In the restoration death will be limited, and there will be abundant life and much praise and rejoicing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Nations Serving Israel, and Israel<br />
Being Priests to All the Nations</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Glory of Jehovah Rising upon Israel,<br />
and the Nations Gathering to Israel</h2>
<p>Isaiah 60:1-9 refers to the time of Israel&rsquo;s restoration when Christ as the Servant of Jehovah will be the glory of Jehovah arising upon Israel. When Christ comes back as the saving Redeemer, Israel as God&rsquo;s elect and as the center of the world&rsquo;s population will be restored in every respect. At that time, all the Gentile nations will be for Israel, and not only Israel&rsquo;s captives but also the wealth of the nations will be gathered to Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Nations Building Israel&rsquo;s Walls<br />
and Ministering to Her with Their Wealth and Glory</h2>
<p>The nations will build Israel&rsquo;s walls and will minister to her with their wealth and glory (vv. 10-14). The word <em>glory</em> in verse 13 refers to the products of the nations (Gen. 31:1, 16; Esth. 1:4). The nations will minister to Israel with their wealth and their best products.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Israel Being the Priests of Jehovah,<br />
and the Gentiles Being Laborers to Israel</h2>
<p>In the restoration Israel will be priests of Jehovah, the ministers of their God. The Gentiles will be laborers to serve Israel (Isa. 61:4-9).</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Jehovah Gathering the Nations<br />
to Worship at Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Jehovah will gather the nations to worship at Jerusalem, and they will bring, as a meal offering to Jehovah, the scattered children of Israel, of whom some will be priests (61:6) and some Levites (66:18-21). Today we offer sinners as sacrifices to God (Rom. 15:16), but in the restoration the nations will bring the scattered Israelites as a meal offering to God. Just as in the Old Testament time, some will be appointed to serve as priests, and others will do the Levitical service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The Old Testament prophets prophesied many times concerning the restoration of Israel. Most of these prophecies were initially and partially fulfilled at the return of the children of Israel from captivity and will be ultimately and fully fulfilled at the restoration of the children of Israel in the millennial age. Isaiah prophesied that the remnant of Jacob will return to the mighty God. The Lord will recover the remnant of His people by His hand. Jehovah will destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt and prepare a highway for the remnant of His people. Jehovah will glean the children of Israel from the flowing stream of the River unto the brook of Egypt, like the beating out of the grain. The ransomed of Jehovah will return and come to Zion with a ringing shout and joy. Christ will be a standard raised up for the gathering of Jehovah&rsquo;s scattered people. Jehovah will restore and cleanse Zion, and Jerusalem will be established. He who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy. Jehovah will create a canopy over Zion and her convocations and will provide His chosen people with a tabernacle. From Zion will go forth instruction, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be a secure habitation. The righteousness of Zion will go forth like brightness, and her salvation like a burning torch. Salvation will come to the daughter of Zion, and they will be called the holy people, the redeemed of Jehovah. In the restoration of Israel, Christ will be their beauty and glory and also their excellence and splendor. The children of Israel will praise Jehovah and draw water with rejoicing from the springs of salvation. In that day there will be singing in the land of Judah and in a vineyard of wine. The Israelites will be increased. The eyes of those who see will not be dim. The Spirit will be poured upon them from on high, and the wilderness will become a fruitful field. Thus, there will be a peaceful habitation. Israel will be made an eternal excellency and a joy, and they will enjoy Jehovah as the eternal light. Jehovah will bless Israel with the blessing of new wine, and they will possess His mountain. There will be rejoicing, exulting, and abundant life in Israel. Then the nations will serve Israel, and Israel will become priests to all the nations. The glory of Jehovah will rise upon Israel, and all the nations will gather to Israel. The nations will build Israel&rsquo;s walls and minister to her with their wealth and glory. Israel will be the priests of Jehovah, and the Gentiles will be laborers to Israel. Jehovah will gather the nations to worship at Jerusalem, and the nations will bring the scattered children of Israel as a meal offering to Jehovah.</p>
