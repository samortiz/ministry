   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many years ago I studied the book of Ephesians very much.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, I did not pay attention to the phrase, the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One day when I came again to Ephesians, these key words stood out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I paid my full attention to them and asked myself what the riches of Christ might be.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I began to see the riches of Christ around 1954, and for over thirty-three years I have studied this one category of divine matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After much study, I began to find out what the riches of Christ are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first major item of the riches of Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the complete Godhead Col 2:9 , not only the fullness of the Godhead of the Father, the Godhead of the Son, or the Godhead of the Spirit alone, but the fullness of the Godhead of the complete Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Several conferences would not be adequate to cover this point alone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another item of the riches of Christ is the incarnation John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you really understand what the incarnation is?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Incarnation is God becoming one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the mingling of divinity with humanity and was the initiation of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Incarnation is much greater and more meaningful than God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Christianity, the incarnation is mostly considered in terms of the Lord as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christians like to tell people at Christmas time that a Savior was born to you today in David s city Luke 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, some have reduced the denotation of incarnation to a Christmas celebration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the celebration of a mass, not of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Few take care of the proper meaning of Christ s birth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ s birth was an incarnation that brought God into man to make God and man one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was not only to produce a Savior but also to produce a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was God and man becoming one in one life and living, while possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ being a man in perfect humanity Phil 2:7-8a is also an item of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you receive Christ as your life, you receive this item of the riches of Christ; you receive a man in perfect humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This Man had a thorough human living Isa 53:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He lived the human life thoroughly on the earth, and this human living is also an item of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Another item of the riches of Christ is His all-inclusive death John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, His death was a redeeming death 1 Tim 2:6 ; we were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, His death was the death that deals with all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It deals with sin Rom 8:3 , the old man Rom 6:6 , the old creation, Satan the Devil Heb 2:14; John 12:31b , the satanic world John 12:31a , and the separating ordinances among different peoples Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these negative things have been dealt with by Christ s all-inclusive death once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, this death is also the life-imparting death John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All these aspects of Christ s all-inclusive death are one item of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ s riches include resurrection Eph 1:20a; 2:6a; Phil 3:10a , ascension Eph 1:20b; 2:6a , and His enthronement Acts 2:36; 5:31a .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Christ ascended to the heavens, God enthroned Him with authority Heb 12:2 and crowned Him with glory and honor Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ s second coming is another item of His riches Phil 3:20-21; 1 Thes 4:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The second coming includes many things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It will bring us glory; Philippians 3:21 says that our body of humiliation will be transfigured into a glorious body at Christ s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ s second coming will bring us into God Himself for us to enjoy God as our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The kingdom, in which we will enjoy Christ s kingship and Christ s priesthood for a thousand years is also an item of the riches of Christ 2 Pet 1:11; Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The divine attributes and human virtues of Christ are a great aggregate of Christ s riches, including a multitude of items.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The divine attributes refer to the characteristics of Christ in His divinity, while human virtues refer to the characteristics of Christ in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The divine attributes are first God s love, then light, then hundreds of items including righteousness, holiness, power, authority, knowledge, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today we are enjoying our God s attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is so good, kind, and merciful; goodness, kindness, and mercy are divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need life, and He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need wisdom, and He is wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need righteousness, holiness, power, and authority, and He is all of these items.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is everything that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We enjoy Him all day as many attributes, and the divine attributes produce in us the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We enjoy His love as a divine attribute, and this attribute produces within us our love toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This love toward others becomes our virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not have humility, but God does.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One day God humbled Himself, lowering Himself to come from the heavens to be a lowly man on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is His humility as a divine attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we enjoy this humility, a humility toward others is produced in us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our Christian humility is a Christian virtue produced from the divine humility as a divine attribute.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot exhaust speaking of all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul said that he received grace to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul preached the riches of Christ as the gospel to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>FOR THE EXHIBITION OF THE PRODUCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Eventually, through our experiences of the riches of Christ, these riches will become an exhibition, a show, of the produce of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our meetings must always be an exhibition to show forth what Christ is, what Christ has, and what Christ does.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do not experience the riches of Christ, there will be no way for them to be exhibited.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we experience many items of the riches of Christ during the day, we will come to the meeting in the evening with the divine attributes which we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we all bring something which we have experienced and put our experience of Christ s riches together, there will be an exhibition of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In this way every meeting will be a show of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hymn #864 in our hymnal is concerning the exhibition of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Such a hymn is very good for speaking to one another Eph 5:19; Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After speaking such a hymn, you will receive a message.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There are many points in this hymn concerning the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verse one and the chorus say,</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whene er we meet with Christ endued,</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The surplus of His plenitude</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We offer unto God as food,</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>And thus exhibit Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Let us exhibit Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Let us exhibit Christ;</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We ll bring His surplus to the church</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>And thus exhibit Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To speak such a hymn to one another will enrich the meeting very much because we have experienced the riches of Christ and have offered this Christ both to God and man through our speaking.</S>
