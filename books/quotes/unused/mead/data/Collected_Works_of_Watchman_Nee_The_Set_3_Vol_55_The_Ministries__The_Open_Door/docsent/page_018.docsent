   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>2 September 1, 1948 A TALK CONCERNING THE FUTURE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF GOD'S WORK IN CHINA God's Work in China</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's work in China formally began with the coming of Protestantism, when it brought the gospel to China.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It has been one hundred years since that time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As far as the advance of God's work is concerned, these one hundred years can be divided into three periods.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Gospel Period</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first period covers the ninety years from Robert Morrison's coming to China until 1900.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This can be called the gospel period.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During this period, the main work of God in China was to preach the gospel to sinners and to lead men to faith in the Lord Jesus as Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During this period, except for a small number of people who witnessed God's deeper work, the majority only heard the gospel through God's grace and came to know the Lord Jesus as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Revival Period</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second period, which began in 1900 and lasted for around thirty years until 1937, can be called the period of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During this period, God not only caused His gospel in China to be more clearly preached, and not only brought more people to a clear understanding of salvation, but also revived many people all over northern and southern China.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These ones were stirred up to consecrate themselves to the Lord and to live and work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These revived ones loved the Lord in their hearts, desired the truth, studied the Bible, zealously preached the gospel, and brought in a revival to the Lord's work everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord's work in China during this period was much improved over the previous period!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, there were only a small number of people who, like firstfruits, received God's deeper grace on top of the grace of revival to advance to a further knowledge in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The majority were satisfied with God's work of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although these ones were more advanced than those in the first period, they needed more advancement!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, God began another period.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Period of Life</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The third period began around 1937 and can be called the period of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although many people in China have been saved and revived, they still do not feel satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are still hungry and thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have been revived to love the Lord with a burning heart and to live for the Lord, and they have felt satisfied, but now these things cannot satisfy them any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although they have all these things, they still feel they have an inward lack.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Inwardly, they have a deeper need which the experience of revival cannot satisfy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their need cannot be satisfied by a mere burning love for the Lord or a practice of living for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At this time God has done a deeper work within them to give them a deeper inward hunger and thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This deeper hunger and thirst can only be satisfied by God's life, and this deeper need can only be met by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During this period of life, God is not working merely in a general way to save and revive men in China; He also is doing a deeper work in some to make them pursue the knowledge of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All those who witness and cooperate with the operation of God's grace in them feel that it is not enough to just live for the Lord; they need deeper experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This deeper experience is the knowledge of the Lord as their life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have already experienced not living to themselves 2 Cor 5:15 , but now the Lord is leading them into the experience of "no longer I who live" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before they were living for the Lord; now God is leading them to learn to let the Lord live for them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before they felt satisfied if everything was for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now they must rely on His life; they must allow Him to live out of them before they feel the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During this period, the so-called revival meetings and revival sermons cannot satisfy the inner need of seeking Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Seeking saints everywhere are hungry and thirsty; they need something deeper to meet their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even though they may not know what their inner need is or be able to explain exactly what they hunger for, when they hear messages about the Lord as their life and how He wants to live out of man, there is a response within them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They yearn for the kind of experience described in these kinds of messages.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This kind of hunger and thirst among the seeking saints everywhere is a sign that God's work in China has gone on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Presently, however, this is still the beginning of the period of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From this point onward, God's children must have a deeper pursuit, knowledge, and experience of His life.</S>
