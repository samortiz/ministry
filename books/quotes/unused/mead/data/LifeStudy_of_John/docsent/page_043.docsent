   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Ministering the Words of God and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dispensing the Spirit without Measure</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 34 says, For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse we see two things: the Lord Jesus ministers the words of God to His people, and He gives the Spirit to God s people without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some versions render this verse incorrectly, saying that God the Father gives the Spirit to the Son without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, if you study the best manuscripts, you will see that it means that the Son gives the Spirit without measure to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus ministers the living Word and the immeasurable Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the local churches we need just two things the living Word and the immeasurable Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today, as the Head of the church, Christ is still ministering these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe that He has especially burdened us with the ministry of the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we speak the Word, it is not we who minister the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We speak, but He ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He ministers His rich Word in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the divine speaker and the divine dispenser.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He ministers the rich Word and dispenses the living Spirit without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the One who ministers the living Word to nourish all of His members.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the One who dispenses the Spirit into all His members in order that they might function in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one else can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is the all-inclusive Spirit and the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In these last days the Lord is going to vindicate His way by means of the rich Word and the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Where is the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is wherever there is the rich Word and the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nothing else can be considered as signs of the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we meet without the riches of the Word and without the livingness of the Spirit and yet claim to meet in the name of the Lord, our claim is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no confirmation, no reality, to back up what we say.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no need for us to claim that we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as we have the rich Word and the living Spirit, that is the vindication that we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Where the Lord Jesus is, there you will find the rich Word and the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>People often talk and argue about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, most of the people who talk and argue about the church are afraid to say anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They just shut their mouths and become unwilling to even use the term church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They say, Don t talk about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is a troublesome thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is difficult for people to say what is right or wrong as far as the church is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is Christ increasing and all the leaders decreasing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever you see that the leaders are increasing and that Christ is imprisoned, that is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is something in which Christ is continually increasing and the leadership decreasing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We know that the ointment of the high priest was poured upon his body and flowed down to his skirt Psa 133:2 , indicating that the rich, living Spirit is not a matter of gift or miracles, but a matter of the anointing in life Psa 133:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the church, Christ, as the all-inclusive Head, gives the Spirit of life without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I like to hear the saints praying freely.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But what would happen if the Head withheld the anointing and we still tried to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If He recalled the anointing, although we might try our best to pray, we would be unable to pray in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We could only pray in a very dry and formal way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In these days I have been watered by listening to the prayers of the saints because those prayers have been filled with the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This anointing comes from the all-inclusive Head.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As long as we have the anointing, we are the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The ointment was poured out upon Aaron s garments, meaning that it was poured upon the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we have to arrange ahead of time for people to pray in a certain meeting, that is an organization, not the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>An organization does not need the anointing, the immeasurable Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A meeting which is filled with prayer from beginning to end would be a proof of the presence of the Head, proving that the whole Body is under the anointing of His immeasurable Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There would be no need for someone to ask us to pray for two and a half hours, for that would be our doing, not the doing of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Who are the church?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Where the Spirit is, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Another sign of the church is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you read the book of Acts, you will see that in the early days of the church there were the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But it was not the Word in black and white letters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Acts the church had the living Word, the Word full of life, light, anointing, and watering.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church has the living and instant Word, the Word that the Lord speaks today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Where there is the living Word, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Praise the Lord that since the day that He raised us up, His holy Word has been open to us in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As the days go by, I believe that the Word will open to us more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We do not need the outward things, because the presence of the Lord is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His living Spirit and His living Word are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This proves where the church is and it also testifies that the Head of the church is the unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is blasphemy to keep a following under our control.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All the following must go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The more we let go of our following, the more the Bible will be open to us, and the more the anointing will be on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brothers and sisters, now is the time that the Lord is going to vindicate His way on the earth, not only in this country, but throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His divine Word will be open to His Body more than ever before.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>And the anointing of the Spirit will be intensified sevenfold Rev 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The all-inclusive Christ, the living Word, and the intensified Spirit will vindicate the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Otherwise, it is difficult for people to know who, where, and what is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hallelujah, we are regenerated people!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have been regenerated for His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>His increase is for the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>John chapter three has three main points: regeneration, the increase, which is the bride of Christ, and the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>F. Loved of the Father</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Father loves the Son 3:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Son is the object of the Father s love.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In love, the Father has made the Son to be above all and to be all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Son s all-inclusiveness is a matter of the Father s love.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>G. With All Given by the Father</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Verse 35 also says that the Father has given all into His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Again the all here does not mainly mean all things or all matters, but all people.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Father has given all people to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Father never gave anyone to John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He has given all His chosen people to His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>None of the chosen people of God belong to John the Baptist or to any Christian worker.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>John and all the Christian workers should not accept any of the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God the Father has given all His elect to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Everyone must go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He is above all, and over all.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>All have been given to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>All must be under His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>H. Believing in This Christ to Have Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Verse 36 says, He who believes in the Son has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In John 3 we see both the Person and work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>All that He is and all that He does is for us to be saved and regenerated that we might be His bride as His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Oh, He is such a wonderful One and He has accomplished such a marvelous work!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Therefore, we must believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>By believing in Him we receive the forgiveness of God and have the divine life, which is the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>By believing in such a One, we receive God s forgiveness, the release from God s condemnation through His redemption, and eternal life, the uncreated life of God, through the Spirit s regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Thus, we are born of God and are delivered from the evil power of Satan and translated into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Otherwise, we shall remain poisoned by Satan and continue under the condemnation of God which will eventually bring His wrath to us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Formerly, we were serpents poisoned by Satan, the enemy of God, and condemned already under the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>But now, thank the Lord, by His death and resurrection, we have been saved and regenerated to be parts of His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Therefore, we are His increase, His reproduction, which is His bride, His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I. Disobeying This Christ</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>to Be under the Wrath of God</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If anyone disobeys this Christ, he will remain under the wrath of God unto perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>But we are not the disobeying ones, but the believing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We shall never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We have been saved from God s condemnation and from Satan s serpentine nature and we have been regenerated with God s eternal life to be the bride of the all-inclusive Christ as His universal increase.</S>
