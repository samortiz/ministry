   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE STATIONS IN ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the book of Romans we see several stations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians have stopped at the station of justification in Romans 4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some have gone further to the station of sanctification in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Other seeking Christians have gone as far as chapter twelve and talk about the Body, although they lack the genuine experience of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, Romans 12 becomes a station, which we may describe as the station of the Body talkers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are content to remain in Romans 12, you will not have the Body actually and practically, because the Body is fully realized in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you are not in a local church, you cannot touch the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word, Body, will simply remain an empty term as far as you are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you want to be in the Body, you must be in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, our station is in chapter sixteen, the last station in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Where are you?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have passed through the station of justification, sanctification, and the stage of talking about the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Praise the Lord that we are abiding in the last station, in the local churches, where we realize the genuine Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you are resting in this station, you can join Paul in his concluding melody of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>V. THE WARNING CONCERNING DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, in Romans 16, a chapter which unveils the ultimate consummation of God s work, Paul speaks of something negative because God s enemy, Satan, is still working here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For such men do not serve as slaves our Lord Christ, but their own appetites; and by smooth and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While we are enjoying the local church life, we must be watchful for those who cause divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 17 Paul refers to the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What teaching is this?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the teaching of the Apostle, such as in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Any discussion or dissension contrary to the Apostle s teaching is divisive, and we must keep a watchful, discerning eye over it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to verse 17, we must turn away from those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even in Paul s time there was the problem of division caused by the dissenting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we also must be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Otherwise, our church life may be damaged by the smooth and flattering speech of the dissenters who are out to deceive the simple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Most churching people are simple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must be simple in order to be in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, some may come to you with smooth, flattering, eloquent talk, seeking to divide the church and to cause you to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not think that you cannot be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can we discern the talk of those who come to us with flattering words?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is just one way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must ask: Does it cause division?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not accept any talk that causes division, regardless of how smooth and flattering the words may be.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must reject any talk that is contrary to the teaching of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must renounce it strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, we must turn away from those who speak in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If Paul faced that kind of difficulty in his time, surely it will also occur in our time because of the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, while we are happy, excited, and praising the Lord for the church life, we must keep a watchful eye over those who cause divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not be deceived by men s smooth words, but should ask ourselves the question: Is this talk contrary to the Apostle s teaching and is it divisive?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must heed the warning given to us by Paul in the last chapter of Romans.</S>
