        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD BEING WITH GOD<br />
AND BEING GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1-3, 18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WORD AND GOD</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; This indicates that whenever God expresses Himself or moves, He does so as the Word. Whenever He comes forth and speaks to man, He does so as the Word. Since the Word is God, why does John speak of the Word as being with God? In order to answer this question, we need to know that there was a very serious theological dispute during the time that John wrote this Gospel. After the ascension of the Lord Jesus, the apostles went out to preach the gospel and to establish churches. However, soon there were disputes among Christians concerning the person of the Lord Jesus. For example, some said that the Lord Jesus was not God and therefore possessed no divinity. Others said that the Lord Jesus was not God from eternity but obtained divinity and His status as God only in time.</p>
<p>In response to these serious heresies, John, the last of the twelve apostles to depart, wrote his Gospel to prove that the Lord Jesus was God from eternity. Just as God is eternal, the Lord Jesus is eternal because the Lord Jesus is God. In addition to his Gospel, John wrote his Epistles in which he spoke of &ldquo;antichrist&rdquo; and &ldquo;antichrists&rdquo; (1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 7). Antichrists are people who deny that the Lord Jesus is God. They go beyond and do not abide in the teaching of Christ (1 John 2:22; 4:3; 2 John 9). Furthermore, John says, &ldquo;Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also&rdquo; (1 John 2:23). This means that we must have the Son in order to have the Father; if we believe only in God but not in the Lord Jesus, who is the Son, as God, we do not have the Father. If we believe only in God and not in the Lord Jesus as God, we have no relationship with God, and God does not have anything to do with us. If we want the objective God to become our subjective God, that is, to be obtained by us and joined to us, we must confess that Jesus is God. Only when we have Jesus Christ do we have God. Only when we have the Son do we have the Father.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Since Jesus Christ is God, what is the distinction between Jesus Christ and God?&rdquo; The apostle John opened his Gospel with a very wonderful utterance. It was an utterance that had never occurred before in human thought. He does not say, &ldquo;In the beginning was Christ,&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the beginning was Jesus.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo; (1:1). He does not refer to the name of the Lord Jesus or to the title of Christ; rather, he refers to the Lord Jesus as the Word. John refers to the Lord Jesus as the Word who was with God and who was God in order to show that the Lord Jesus is not only the mysterious, hidden God but also the revealed God. He is the God who is distinct in His revelation. The distinction between God and the Word is not a distinction based on one being God and the other being the Word. The Lord Jesus is not only God but also the Word. In other words, the Lord Jesus is more than just God; He is the revealed God. Verse 18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; Without being the Word, God could never be seen; however, as the Word, the Lord Jesus is the declared God, the seen God.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit inspired the apostle John to write these words, He was implying that the Lord is not only God but also God in His distinct revelation. He is not only God in eternity but also the uttered and declared God, who can be revealed. Without being the Word, there would be no possibility for man to see Him or know Him. Without being the Word, He could not declare Himself; He would be silent, hidden, and incomprehensibly mysterious. However, as both God and the Word, He is the uttered, declared, and expressed God.</p>
<p>When we consider human words, it is easy to understand that words are separate from a speaker. As soon as a person speaks, the words that are spoken are separate from him. This is also true in regard to writing a letter. As soon as a person writes words on a piece of paper, the words are separate from the writer. Even though human words are an utterance, a declaration, they are no longer a part of us after they are uttered. Hence, when the apostle John said, &ldquo;The Word was with God,&rdquo; he was making a very important point: The Word is not separate from God; the Word is with God. Wherever the Word goes, God goes, and wherever the Word is, God is.</p>
<p>If John only wrote, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; it would be possible to think that the Lord Jesus, as the Word, is separate from God. This would be a serious theological error. However, even as the Word, He is with God; He is not separate from God. Since the phrase <em>the Word was with God</em> could also be understood to suggest that the Word is different from God, John also says, &ldquo;The Word was God.&rdquo; The Word is with God, not in the way of separation, but in the way of oneness.</p>
<p>Theologically, this verse is like a nation&rsquo;s constitution, which must be very precise in order to avoid disputes. However, it was still possible for some to debate with John by saying, &ldquo;It is correct to say that &lsquo;He was the Word,&rsquo; &lsquo;in the beginning was the Word,&rsquo; &lsquo;He was God,&rsquo; and that &lsquo;He was with God,&rsquo; but His being with God may not have been from the beginning in eternity; He may have become God only at some point in time.&rdquo; Indeed, in the second and third centuries, some were saying that the Lord Jesus obtained His divine status only at a point in time. Even some authoritative Bible expositors at the beginning of the twentieth century made this mistake, saying that the Lord Jesus was not Christ from eternity but that He became the Son of God, Christ, at a certain point in time. They could say this only if they ignored what John says in verse 2: &ldquo;He was in the beginning with God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four phrases, written by the apostle John, fully define the person of the Lord Jesus. These four solid and unshakable phrases are <em>in the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God,</em> and <em>He was in the beginning with God.</em> With these four phrases, there is no basis for dispute concerning the person of Christ. He is the Word, the Word that was in the beginning. Moreover, in His revelation He is with God, and He is God. Finally, His being with God was from the beginning, not just from a point in time. This tells us that He was not only God, but God in His coming forth. No one has ever seen God, but as the Word, the Son has declared Him (v. 18).</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
