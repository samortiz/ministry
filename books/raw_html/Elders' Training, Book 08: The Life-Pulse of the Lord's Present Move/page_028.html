<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FULL-TIME</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1; Acts 20:34; 18:3; 1 Cor. 9:6-15; Phil. 4:13-19; 1 Tim. 5:17</h1>
<p>The matter of being full-time has been very much misunderstood for centuries. The common thought in Christianity is that being a preacher or a pastor is a kind of profession. You have to be hired and people either pay you or they may fire you. According to the New Testament, however, to be a full-timer should not be to take a kind of profession.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRESENTING OUR BODIES</h2>
<p>Romans 12:1 says, &ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.&rdquo; Actually, for one to present his body to God is to go full-time. If you do not go full-time, how could your body be free to be presented to God as a living sacrifice? Our entire being is contained in our body, and our body is confined in our time. Therefore, the body is the center of these two things, the center of our being and the center of our time. The being is what we are, and the time is where we exist. We can change the places where we live, but we cannot move ourselves out of time. You always remain in time. To present your body to God means you give yourself to God. This is to be full-time. We Christians should all be full-timers. We have to give ourselves to Him. We do not give ourselves to anything else, only to our saving God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SCATTERED FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>Consider those approximately eight thousand saints in Jerusalem who were scattered. Acts 8:1 says that beside the apostles, all of the disciples were scattered. They went out. Were they not full-timers? They were scattered not to do a job, but Acts tells us they were scattered to spread the glad tidings (8:4). I believe their number was at least eight thousand. One day three thousand were saved (2:41), and another day five thousand (4:4). They all were scattered to preach the gospel. What were they? They all were full-timers. They were scattered throughout all of Judea and they also reached Samaria. That was a fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s word in Acts 1:8: &ldquo;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria.&rdquo; This was accomplished not through preachers or apostles but through the scattered full-timers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL MAKING TENTS TO SUPPORT HIMSELF<br />
AND HIS CO-WORKERS</h2>
<p>Christianity considers that Paul was a preacher, but Acts 18:3 tells us that he was in a trade making tents. Paul went purposely to stay with his co-workers, Priscilla and Aquila, because they were in the same trade. Probably they made tents together. Paul not only made money to support himself, he also made money to support his co-workers (Acts 20:34).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO PREACH THE GOSPEL<br />
LIVING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 9:14 tells us that those who preach the gospel should live of the gospel. Fifty years ago in Chefoo, we began to have the church life without any hired preacher. A friend of mine who was a generation older than I and highly educated argued. He said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong for a person to be paid as a preacher? The Bible says whoever preaches the gospel lives of the gospel.&rdquo; Apparently his word was right. But Paul does not say that the preacher of the gospel is paid by somebody. He says that he lives of the gospel. Because no one supported Paul, however, he had to make tents. The church in Corinth, whom he served, thought he took advantage of them, that he was a person of guile (2 Cor. 12:16 and note 2). Thus, he did not use his right to live of the gospel with the saints in Corinth. He preached the gospel, yet lived on his tent making.</p>
<p>Paul illustrated his right to live of the gospel in several ways. He likened his apostolic ministry to that of a soldier, a farmer, a shepherd, an ox on a threshing field, and a priest serving God by offering sacrifices for the people (1 Cor. 9:7-15). He illustrated in these many ways to vindicate himself, proving that he did have the right to live of the gospel. But due to the wrong environment in Corinth, he would not use that right.</p>
