You need to apply these principles and group together the dear ones who are under your care. In your group meetings you should not have any kind of religious service or form of worship. Furthermore, you should not conduct yourself as if you are going to teach others. All these ways you must drop. Just come together with your group in a natural way to have a mutual fellowship with them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Practicing to Prophesy</H2><P>Then, from the group meetings you should go on to prophesying. The most difficult of the four steps of the God-ordained way is prophesying. However, we all can learn to prophesy if we will have a definite beginning and also take the time to practice.</P><P>Some dissenting ones have proclaimed that 1 Corinthians 14 is not written to all the believers. They say that it is directed only to a certain class of believers who are considered prophets. This is a wrong teaching. First Corinthians 14:1 says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy." The first verse of 1 Corinthians 14 does not refer only to the so-called prophets; rather, it refers to all the saints, including us. Then verses 23 and 24 say, "If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and...all prophesy..." These verses show that in the church meetings, all the believers can prophesy (v. 31). Therefore, we should not listen to the erroneous teaching of the dissenters. Rather, we should receive the apostles' teaching in 1 Corinthians 14.</P><P>I beg you to take my word. From now on you yourself must do something. You must begin by studying the first step of the God-ordained way: how to get people regenerated. Then, you must find the way to practice it with your companions. I do believe that you will see some results. Especially the elders, those who take care of the churches, must themselves have a practical beginning with some companions. They should not promote this to the entire congregation; that way does not work. The elders themselves must take the lead to do it.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_068.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>The Practice of the Church Life according to the God-ordained Way &nbsp; pg 69</div><br></body></html>
