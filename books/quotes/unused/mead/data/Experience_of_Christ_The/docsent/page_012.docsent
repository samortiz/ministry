   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE WITH ONE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the book of Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This fact is recognized by most Christian teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians point to Paul's word in Philippians 3 about counting all things loss for Christ and knowing Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I do not know of any who have pointed out the fellowship in the gospel and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The way to experience Christ is not firstly to know the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is firstly to participate in the fellowship in the gospel by the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>PROBLEMS WITH THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both the fellowship in the gospel and the Spirit of Jesus Christ are unusual expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Chapter one contains other unusual expressions, such as "in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel" v. 27, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>. It is rather easy for us to understand the expression "in one spirit," but not the phrase "with one soul."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The translators of the King James Version rendered this "with one mind."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They interpreted the Greek word used here, psuche, as mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first problem we have with our soul is with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is especially true of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second main part of the soul is the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This presents a special problem to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regarding our soul, we are also troubled by our stubborn will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, in our soul we have a troublesome mind, a perplexing emotion, and a stubborn will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The soul is the most intricate and complicated part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As tripartite creatures, we have a body, a soul, and a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although our body has many members and is difficult to take care of, it is not as perplexing to us as our soul is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The simplest part of our being is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The part of us that troubles us the most is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Tears, for example, do not issue from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sisters' tears come from their emotion, and the brothers' tears come from their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I can assure the brothers that if we did not think so much, we would not have any tears.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For the brothers, the mind is the fountain of tears.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The most thoughtful people suffer the most.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who think a great deal commit suicide more often than those who are simple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When certain thoughtful people find no way to go on in life, they commit suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our mind and emotion need tuning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But our stubborn will frustrates this tuning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is nothing wrong with having a thoughtful mind and a sensitive emotion, but they need to be adjusted by our will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, our will is stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to use our will as a brake to restrict our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But often this brake does not seem to work because our will is stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever we lose control of our emotion, it means that our will is not functioning properly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some sisters seem to have only an emotion, not a will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Likewise, certain brothers seem to have only a mind and not a will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to use our will to control our mind and our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In writing Philippians 1:27, Paul did not say "with one mind"; he said "with one soul."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The mind does not include all the problems we have with our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The mind, emotion, and will all give us difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, in translating Philippians 1:27, it is better to say "with one soul."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to be one soul, we must not remain in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The problem with the experience of Christ is not mainly with our spirit, but with our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those outside the Lord's recovery, however, may have a problem with their spirit because few know anything about the spirit or how to exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many have only an objective Christ, a Christ far away in the heavens, and do not know the Christ who is in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They have no idea that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is now indwelling their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we who have been in the church life for a number of years are somewhat familiar with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With us, the problem in experiencing Christ is mainly with our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the past we have laid great emphasis upon the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But simply to speak of the spirit in the experience of Christ is not adequate, for we have not only a spirit, but also a soul.</S>
