   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND RECEIVING THE LORD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The initiation of life begins with the Spirit, but the word is needed for the growth, spread, and expansion of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the initiation of life is through the Spirit, the growth of life is through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know that the Lord is the Spirit in our spirit, and we can enjoy Him by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we call, we are breathing; that is, we are receiving Him as air.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we breathe more, our breathing becomes our drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sister M. E. Barber wrote a hymn that says, Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed Hymns, #73 . As our breathing increases, it becomes our drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, in addition to breathing and drinking, we must eat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our physical body needs both air and water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, in order to receive a rich supply of nutrients for our growth, we need food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, we should not only breathe and drink but also eat in order to receive the necessary nutrients.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must have the Lord s Word in order to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, eating is related to pray-reading the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some have said mistakenly that we only need to call on the Lord s name, that we do not need to listen to messages or read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not true; we need the Bible more than anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people read the Bible only with their eyes; others study it with their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, when we pray-read the Lord s Word, we receive the words of the Bible into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We want and need the Bible very much.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is the Bible that we want, not man s nonsensical words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We also need the ministry of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not reject the practice of ministering the Word; rather, we reject only messages that do not supply life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE CHURCH NEEDING LIVING MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the Lord has mercy, the churches in every place should receive several messages every week that are living, strong, and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church in Los Angeles does not reject the ministry of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the contrary, at least four messages are given every week.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am not boasting; I can testify that every message is a living message.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need the ministry of the Word, a ministry that is living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Gospel of John there is the Spirit, and there is also the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not enough to have just the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not enough to just breathe and drink; there is a need to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to breathe moment by moment, drink seven or eight times a day, and eat at least three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the church there should be at least two to three messages a week to supply God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may ask, What if we do not have living messages?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our messages are not living, we should go to Joseph to buy grain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may encounter a great famine, but there is enough supply in Joseph s storehouse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should go to Joseph to buy grain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Who is Joseph?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Joseph is the glorified Lord Jesus, the Christ on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not have our spirit merely enlivened or our thirst quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our hunger also needs to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church needs solid food; all the local churches need this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not need to spend as much time eating as we do breathing, because we need to breathe every second.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, several messages a week will be adequate to feed and satisfy the saints with food.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everyone needs to bear responsibility in this matter; everyone needs to pray and ask the Lord to release His speaking among us, asking that His Word would be open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>ENJOYING THE LORD S WORD DAILY</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BY EATING AND DRINKING</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must eat the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I once drew a diagram of a triangle with the words God, Spirit, and Word at the corners.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God is Spirit 4:24 , and God is also the Word 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, the Word is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The words that the Lord has spoken to us are spirit 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, the three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot contact God without breathing in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Neither can we contact God and breathe in the Spirit without dealing with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>None of us can live apart from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should have more than one Bible so that we can have the Word with us at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should never be separated from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All day long we should eat the Lord s Word, because the Lord Himself is the Word, and His words are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we open the Bible, we should not focus on understanding but on eating and being nourished in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is one thing to understand the food that we eat for breakfast, but it is another thing to eat and digest the food.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the same principle we need to digest the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Pray-reading the Bible is to eat the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As long as we take in the Lord s Word, our spirit will spontaneously digest the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Two different Greek words are translated as word or words in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For example, the Greek word for words in 6:63 is rhema, which is different from the Greek word for Word in 1:1, which is logos.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The former refers to the instant word, and the latter, to the constant word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord gives us both the instant word and the constant word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For example, John 3:16 says, For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is an example of His constant word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, when the Lord spoke to the man who had been impotent for thirty-eight years, saying, Rise, take up your mat and walk 5:8 , He was speaking an instant word to him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All the words in the Bible are constant; however, when the Lord repeats a constant word to us, it becomes an instant word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whether the Lord s words are constant or instant to us, we should receive His words constantly.</S>
