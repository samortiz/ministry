   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:Evening, December 30, 1947</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading: John 1:16-17; Rom 5:21; 6:14; 1 Cor 15:10; 2 Cor 12:9; Phil 4:23 GOD'S GRACE NOT BEING OUTWARD THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we want to consider what God's grace is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many times we hear people say, "Thank God for His grace, that I have not had any accident."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These people think that God's grace is to keep them from having an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Others think that to make a few thousand dollars is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Still others think that for a person's whole family to be free from illness and calamities is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people ask God for a lovely little baby, or a good husband, a good wife, or good children.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They think that these are grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They think that God's grace being sufficient means that they will lack no food or clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Still others say that joy, peace, and power are God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these concepts are not necessarily correct.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GOD'S GRACE BEING HIMSELF RECEIVED BY US</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's grace is God putting Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To receive grace is to receive something that we do not deserve to have.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is to receive something without a price, something free from God Rom 4:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Receiving God is better than receiving everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nothing else is worth much, for all things are vanity of vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A bad husband is surely vanity, but a good husband is also vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Good children and many riches are all vanities.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must never think that grace is success and accomplishment in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If God were to give us things of vanity as grace, He would be deceiving us indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God gives us grace, He is actually giving us Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul forsook everything for the sake of gaining the priceless treasure Phil 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a person has God, he has the best treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why the Bible tells us that grace is not some thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, it is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Grace Enabling Paul to Labor More Exceedingly</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not consider grace as a thing or a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul became the leading apostle, and he became a diligent and laboring person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He became such a one through grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was through such a living person that he was able to do what others could not do and suffer what others could not suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Grace Being God as Life and Power in Us</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who do not have God within surely do not have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they encounter difficulties, they shed tears easily, and it is easy for them to be sorrowful and in distress.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who have God within them may appear sorrowful outwardly, but they can rejoice inwardly because of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the money in the world could not buy the strength they have.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Good children are not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Could you still say "hallelujah!" if your child were to die one day?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Neither is it grace to have a fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If your business were to close down one day, what would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Others may hang themselves, or kill themselves by drowning in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What about you?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Could you still praise the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To have peace is not necessarily to have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you were to have a car accident one day, could you still thank the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>True grace is the inward power to overcome what others cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do you have this grace?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I can tell you that I have it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everyone who does not live by this grace is living in vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you have God within you, if you live by God, and if God becomes your life and your strength, and He comforts you, supports you, and is with you all the time, you are experiencing God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Never pay too much attention to the things and the works.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even if the whole world were given to you, it would all become vanity after a few decades.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All those who know God, the One by whom we live, are persons who know grace and are blessed persons.</S>
