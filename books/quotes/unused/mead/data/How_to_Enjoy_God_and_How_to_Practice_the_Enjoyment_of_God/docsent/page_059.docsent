   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN EXERCISING TO PRAY IN THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Jude 20 THE NECESSITY OF PRAYING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will practice praying with Jude 20.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse speaks about two things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, it speaks of being built up in the most holy faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is related to reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, it speaks of praying in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is related to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No other verse in the Bible is as concise as this verse in the matter of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Prayer should be in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should pray in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Prayer, which is a matter of man cooperating with God, must possess two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Prayers that come only from man, which are not mingled with God, are merely religious prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not touch God, breathe in God, or reach God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason that Jude says we should pray in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The words in the Holy Spirit are very good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Ephesians 6:18 the Chinese Union Version translates this portion as praying by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The meaning of praying by the Spirit is unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jude, however, is translated correctly; we should pray in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praying in the Holy Spirit means that we and the Holy Spirit must pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The secret to the Christian life is to be mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The spiritual life of a Christian is absolutely a matter of man being mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are in the Holy Spirit, we have a spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are not in the Holy Spirit, we do not have a spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is possible for us to have all kinds of religious activities, but if we are not in the Holy Spirit, there is no way for us to have a genuine spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This particularly applies to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Apart from the Holy Spirit we only have religious prayers that are commonly found in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These prayers have no spiritual worth before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we want genuine, spiritual prayers, prayers that reach God, touch God, breathe in God, and are in God, we must pray in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BEING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT INVOLVING</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE FELLOWSHIP AND MINGLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WITH OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since many brothers and sisters still may not understand what it is to be in the Holy Spirit, let me explain further.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is Spirit, and we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our spirit is the same in nature as the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s Spirit is invisible and non-material.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our spirit is also invisible and non-material.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have a spirit within us that enables us to contact God who is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus said that God is Spirit and that he who worships Him must worship in spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that we must turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit in order to worship and touch God who is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These two spirits, the Spirit of God and our spirit, need to fellowship with one another, live with one another, and be mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word with reveals that the Spirit and our spirit are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We were created as men, and we have a spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the time of our salvation, the blood washed us, and the Holy Spirit entered into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus said that when the Spirit comes, He will be with us forever 14:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He will abide within us forever.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every believer has the Spirit of God in His spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God s Spirit is in our spirit, and our spirit is in His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The expressions You in Me and I in you are both found in the Gospel of John v. 20 . This transpires in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You in Me means that our spirit is in His Spirit, and I in you means that His Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The phrase abide in Me and I in you means that our spirit abides in His Spirit, and His Spirit abides in our spirit 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These portions of the Scriptures describe a condition in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some may ask how we know that such a condition exists in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How do we know that the Spirit of God abides in our spirit and that our spirit abides in His Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, how do we know that there is a fellowship and mingling between the two spirits within us?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is something every believer can easily know.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, even though our outward circumstances may be painful and difficult to bear, we have a sweet sense of consolation and unspeakable joy deep within us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This sense of comfort and joy comes from experiencing God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a sense of being before God, of being together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At other times we may be bewildered, not knowing what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we would look to the Lord, the condition within us would be bright and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We would spontaneously be clear concerning how to proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This condition deep within us is the story of God s Spirit being mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes we may feel dry, empty, and unsure of ourselves even though we are lacking in nothing outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may feel ill at ease whether we are sitting, walking, or lying down.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This reveals that our spirit is short of God s presence; our spirit is lacking the nourishment of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is a lack between our spirit and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These examples help us to understand what it means for God s Spirit to be in our spirit and for our spirit to be in His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once we understand the story of mutual fellowship between these two spirits, we can understand what it means to be in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To be in the Holy Spirit is absolutely a matter in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is a story about a brother whose countenance was glowing with an indescribable joy as he was working.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He was so happy that he was even laughing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This caused his colleagues to ask what was happening to him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They thought that it was something psychological.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He responded that since they did not have Jesus within them, they could not understand what was happening.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He said that his joy was the issue of his spirit fellowshipping with the Spirit of God within him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, he could not help but be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He said that if his happiness was merely something psychological, it would be unnatural and forced.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When his spirit fellowshipped with the Spirit of God, all of his burdens disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He could not help but have a happiness that came from the depth of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is a story about being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As long as we touch God s Spirit with our spirit, such an experience will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Although we cannot see the Spirit of God with our eyes or feel Him with our hands, we can clearly sense Him when He touches us within.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>On the evening of His resurrection the Lord Jesus breathed into the disciples and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord Jesus used breath to represent the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Although we can neither see nor touch air, we know that it has entered us because we feel inwardly relieved, refreshed, and comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In contrast, when there is insufficient air in a room, we feel stuffy and uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is a good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This also applies to the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When we are short of the Holy Spirit, we feel oppressed, bound, and constricted within, but when we fellowship with the Holy Spirit, we are immediately relieved and refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This condition indicates that the Holy Spirit is within us and that He is mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This proves that our spirit abides in God s Spirit and that His Spirit abides in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In other words, we are abiding in God, and God is abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is absolutely a matter in the spirit.</S>
