<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Q. The Present Churches Being Old<br>and Filled with Problems</H2><P>The opposers also have said that the present churches are old and full of problems. We need to see that the churches mentioned in the New Testament all had problems. The church in Jerusalem was a young church, but it also had the problem of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11) and the problem concerning the distribution of food to the widows (6:1). One does not need to be old to have troubles or to become sick. The elders who take care of the churches have to deal with problems continually. As long as you are a living, organic person, each day there is the possibility of sickness.</P><P>The Epistles in the New Testament were written to churches with problems. If these churches had not had any problems, we would not have these New Testament Epistles today. Thank the Lord, because the churches had problems in the early days, we have the New Testament Epistles which have become a great help to us today. First Corinthians is a long Epistle of sixteen chapters. Every chapter deals with problems. In 1 Corinthians 11:34, after dealing with a number of problems, Paul said, "And the rest I will set in order when I come." By this Paul was saying, "In this Epistle I addressed eleven of your problems. But there are still a number of other problems. I cannot cover them now, but I will when I come."</P><P>I was in the church in Chefoo in 1932 at the beginning of the Lord's recovery in northern China. Basically we knew only that we had to leave the denominations and meet together. We did not have our own hymnal, and we did not know how to choose a hymn. We did not know the proper way to have the Lord's table. We also did not know how to praise the Lord in a high way. Today, however, our practice, our praises, and our hymns are higher. The churches today are much higher than they were sixty or even thirty years ago.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>R. Reality versus the Doctrine and<br>Systematized Teaching of Brother Lee</H2><P>The dissenting ones have said that reality is versus the doctrine and systematized teaching of Brother Lee. To their opinion, I have been teaching too much. They have condemned my teaching, my training, and my conferences because they said that these are the means for me to control the churches. Actually, my teaching does not control anyone, but it does regulate us, including me.</P><P>One brother in the past pointed out that if a speaker cannot speak something higher than himself, he is a poor speaker. We must learn to teach and preach things which are higher than what we are. Our reality can never match our revelation. Did Paul's reality match his revelation? Did Paul's experiences come up to his revelation? The Lord Jesus Himself is the only one whose reality fully matched His teaching. Apart from Him, no one on this earth can have the real experience to fully match his own teaching. The dissenting ones have also said that my teachings are systematized. This is not true. I have never taught anything in a system.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>S. The Church of the Saints&#151;Democracy</H2><P>In 1988 the dissenting ones claimed that there should be democracy among us since the church is the church of the saints. In the Old Testament with Israel and in the New Testament with the believers, the government among God's people is neither democracy nor autocracy. It is theocracy, which is government by God Himself. Democracy is better than autocracy in the political realm, but among God's people, neither of these ways should have any place. God's people should have only theocracy. Theos (God) is our Ruler. He is living, and today He is the all-inclusive Spirit within us and among us. We have to learn to listen to Him. The church should be under God's ruling.</P>
