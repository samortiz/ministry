   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR FULL-TIMERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Of course, for the spreading of the gospel, the teaching of the truth, the ministering of life, and the building up of the church, we still need some full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this reason, the support for the full-timers is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I would rather sacrifice the big meeting hall in Lin-ko than neglect the need of the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether or not we can build the big meeting hall is a secondary matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The primary goal is to raise up two thousand five hundred full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have heard that some halls or churches feel that the burden for the support of the full-timers is too heavy, and they are considering down-sizing, or laying off, some of the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I beg you before the Lord, not to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This should never happen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must have a strong resolution within ourselves that even if we must sell everything, we need to increase the number of full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even if we must sell our hall, we need to continue our effort to produce more full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I feel that even if we must sell the land in Lin-ko, and even if we must borrow a few million dollars from other places, we need to do it to continue supporting the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must reach the goal of having two thousand five hundred full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I also hope that we can increase the support of the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The budget for them is too small.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have given up their future, their positions, and consecrated everything to the Lord and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church should take care of their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not be afraid of giving them too much.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not afraid to do too much in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why are we afraid to be too much when it comes to supporting the full-timers?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is an attack from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It delays the work of the Lord s building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must not be afraid of doing too much.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should only be afraid that we have not done enough.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the full-timers squander the support that the church gives them, and if they spend their money on unnecessary things, it proves that they are not qualified to be full-timers, and they should not serve full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the full-timers hear this word, they should bow down to worship the Lord, and they should also serve with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let me give my own testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord used me to spread His work from Southeast Asia to the West.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In twenty-three years, more than a hundred churches have been raised up in South America, North America, Europe, Africa, and Australasia.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I admit that the Lord has used me to some extent, and the brothers and sisters have respected me and have supplied me abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Still, other than expenses related to daily necessities, I have offered up all the money I have received year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During my twenty-three years in the United States, I have purchased only one small automobile, which was a second-hand car for which I paid eight hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, I gave it away to a poorer brother, and I lived without a car of my own.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What I am saying is that if the young people receive more supply from the Lord, they should learn to give.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we keep everything to ourselves, we are not qualified to be a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must learn to take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As I have said before, years ago in Southeast Asia one brother received the burden to care for all the needs of the work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His offering not only made possible the purchase of the many pieces of property in Taiwan for building meeting halls, it also supported the livelihood of the full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Beginning in 1950 there was a need to supply more than one hundred seventy people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although not all their needs were covered, they were supplied enough to not experience total deprivation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Up until 1963 I was still supporting part of their needs from America.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The churches gradually picked up the support, and by 1967 I was completely relieved of this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During this time, while I was in the United States, I experienced extreme hardship myself, yet the Lord did not fail to provide a bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers, let me say a fair word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who receive the supply should realize that the money they are spending is the hard-earned money of the saints, who offer out of their love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a love is priceless.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The receiving ones should not take it lightly or spend the money loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the same time, when they have an excess, they should take care of the needs of other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church should be liberal in its support of the full-timers, but it should be careful in its own spending.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On their part, the full-timers should be faithful in the way they handle money, and they should also take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By this summer at least a hundred full-timers will be produced in Taipei, but in order to gospelize Taiwan, we need to have two thousand five hundred by 1988.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need at least a thousand of them now.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not an easy target to reach.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hope that we will be clear that the building of the big meeting hall in Lin-ko is not our primary goal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our unique goal is the work of gospelizing Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For the need of the gospel in its various aspects, we need to work with what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If our finances permit us, we will buy gospel vans.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If they do not permit us, we will use public transportation, but we cannot give up the work of gospelization.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We do not want a big meeting hall without the power of the gospel or the practical spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some may criticize me for always changing my way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In reality, as long as we want to improve, we need to change.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The reason Taiwan is so prosperous today is that it does not limit itself to one method.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It improves from one method to the next.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This keeps us from failure.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the Lord s recovery I have worked from Chefoo to Shanghai to Taiwan, and from Southeast Asia to the West.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have had smooth sailing, and my morale is as strong as ever.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The reason for this is that I vowed to succeed in all my endeavors.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Of course, I have had failures, but I was not discouraged and did not lose heart.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Instead, I considered the failures to be the predecessors to success.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Failure or success lies not in the attainment of the goal but in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The revolution of Mr. Sun Yat-sen experienced many failures, but in the end it was a success.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It was a success because his goal was clear and his aim was single.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am clear that the new way of the Lord s recovery will become a success because our goal is right and our motive is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We all admit that Mr. Sun Yat-sen rescued the Chinese nation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>History has justified his achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In principle, this can be compared to the Lord s recovery today; its justification is undisputed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Six thousand years of human history have culminated in the consummate truth of the Bible, and this truth is what we are working out in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the reason we have the boldness and assurance to point out the mistakes of Christianity in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because of the slander of the evil ones, we were engaged in a legal battle.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thank the Lord that the truth eventually prevailed.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>One theologian even wrote a book to defend our position.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is because our goal is clear, our truth is accurate, and our motive is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This litigation cost more than five million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>No one thought that we would have the courage to carry it out, but my mind was set.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I would fight this battle even if it meant selling the hall in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the end, we did not sell our hall in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Instead, we built the Irving meeting hall in the midst of the litigation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Do not think that I was fighting that battle alone.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I did this in the Body and with all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Today we need to see that we are in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are co-workers together, and we have the same future.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If today in Taipei we can reach the high ground of the new way, we will have secured a great victory for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We will build up the church in the believers homes and accomplish God s eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Just as you encouraged me during the litigation process, I want to encourage you today, and I want to be encouraged through your encouragement.</S>
