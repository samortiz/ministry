<h1 class="title">The Way to Become the Man-child</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 12:2, 5, 10-11; Gal. 4:19;<br />
Luke 1:53; Eph. 3:16-17; 6:17-18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The entire being of the man-child is saturated and permeated with the element of Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The woman in Revelation 12 has been impregnated by her Husband in order to bring forth something for her Husband&mdash;vv. 2, 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church&rsquo;s duty is not mainly to do something for Christ but to receive something of Christ that she may be made pregnant of Christ and may bring forth the man-child for Christ&mdash;Gal. 1:15-16a; 2:20; 4:19; Phil. 1:21.</li>
		<li>The principle in becoming the firstfruits or the man-child is the same: we must follow the Lamb wherever He goes by having the Lamb constituted into our being&mdash;Rev. 14:4; cf. Exo. 12:8, 11.</li>
		<li>We need to constantly be open to the Lord as our Husband to permit the element of Christ, the divine constituent of Christ, to work in us continually to saturate and permeate our whole being&mdash;Matt. 5:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Whether or not we will be included in the man-child depends upon how we react to God&rsquo;s desire, God&rsquo;s move, and God&rsquo;s eternal economy:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we would be a part of the man-child, we must eat more, grow more, and become stronger&mdash;Rom. 5:10; 1 Cor. 16:13; John 6:57.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery depends upon the hungry ones, the stronger ones, not the indifferent ones&mdash;Luke 1:53; Matt. 5:6; Rev. 3:16-18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way to become the man-child, the stronger part within the woman, is unveiled in the book of Ephesians:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The key to our becoming the stronger part within the woman is for us to be strengthened into our inner man that Christ may build Himself into our hearts&mdash;3:16-17; 1 Cor. 16:13; 2 Tim. 1:6-7.</li>
	<li>In order to become the man-child, we must also be nourished with all the riches of Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:8, 18; 1 Tim. 4:6-7.</li>
	<li>The way to be strong is by putting on the whole armor of God, which is the all-inclusive Christ, by pray-reading the killing word&mdash;Eph. 6:10-11, 17-18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The way we fight against the enemy is by prayer&mdash;v. 12; Dan. 6:10; 10:11-14, 19-21.</li>
		<li>The way to fight is to take the word by means of all prayer so that the word becomes a sword for slaying the adversary and all the negative things within us&mdash;Eph. 6:17-18.</li>
		<li>We should not simply have one way of prayer but every means of prayer, exercising our spirit to pray in various ways to take the word of God&mdash;Eph. 3:14; cf. 2 Sam. 7:25, 27; Dan. 9:2-3.</li>
		<li>As word after word penetrates into our being, our opinions, concepts, desires, and choices are slain&mdash;cf. Rev. 3:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Those who constitute the man-child overcome the devil (the accuser, the slanderer), who is Satan, the adversary of God&mdash;Rev. 12:10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>They overcome him because of the blood of the Lamb:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Satan may accuse us, but we can answer that the blood of Jesus Christ, God&rsquo;s Son, cleanses us from every sin&mdash;1 John 1:7.</li>
		<li>Any apparent condemnation that does not stop after we have confessed and applied the blood is not God&rsquo;s enlightenment but Satan&rsquo;s accusation&mdash;v. 9.</li>
		<li>We must not only reject the accusations which are without cause, but we must also reject all the accusations which have cause.</li>
		<li>When we commit sin, we do not glorify God, but when we do not trust the precious blood, we dishonor Him all the more&mdash;Matt. 26:28; cf. Heb. 10:29.</li>
		<li>We must always apply the blood, telling the devil that although we are not perfect, we are under the perfect blood&mdash;1 Pet. 1:18-19; Acts 20:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>They overcome him because of the word of their testimony:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;Testimony&rdquo; means to tell others what there is in Christ, and the word of testimony is something which must be spoken forth.</li>
		<li>The overcomers must frequently proclaim the victory of Christ, testifying that the devil has been judged by the Lord&mdash;1 John 3:8; Heb. 2:14.</li>
		<li>Satan does not fear when we try to reason with him, but he does fear when we proclaim the spiritual facts of Christ&rsquo;s victory&mdash;cf. 2 Chron. 20:20-22:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>That the name of Jesus is above every name is a spiritual fact which we must declare in faith, not only to men but also to Satan&mdash;Phil. 2:9-11; 1 Cor. 12:3b.</li>
			<li>We must proclaim to Satan and his demons that Jesus is Lord, that the Lord is victorious, and that Satan has been crushed under His feet&mdash;Gen. 3:15; John 14:30b; Rom. 16:20.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The word of testimony causes Satan to lose his ground&mdash;James 4:7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>They love not their soul-life even unto death:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Due to Adam&rsquo;s fall Satan has joined himself to man&rsquo;s soul-life, man&rsquo;s self; to overcome him we should not love our soul-life but rather hate it and deny it&mdash;Matt. 16:23-24; Luke 14:26; 9:23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Satan wants us to act in our own strength and move in ourselves with the power of our soul, our natural ability.</li>
			<li>Natural ability is that ability which we originally had and which has never been dealt with by the operation of the cross.</li>
			<li>The failure of the church is due to man&rsquo;s bringing in his natural ability.</li>
			<li>The purpose of the cross is to deal with our natural strength and ability so that we will not dare to move by ourselves, as seen in the cases of Moses and Peter&mdash;Acts 7:23-30; Luke 22:32-34; 1 Pet. 5:5-6.</li>
			<li>We should have the attitude that we will not live by our self in any way; we will not value our own ability or have any self-confidence&mdash;1 Cor. 2:2-4; Phil. 3:3; cf. Isa. 11:2b.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We must be self-sacrificing persons, a drink offering, allowing Christ as the heavenly wine to fill us and cause us to become wine to God&mdash;Phil. 2:17; 2 Tim. 4:6; Judg. 9:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
