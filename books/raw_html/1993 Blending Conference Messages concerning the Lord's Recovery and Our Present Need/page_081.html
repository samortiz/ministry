<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A VITAL GROUP CAN COME INTO BEING<br>ONLY BY A SAINT WHO IS DESPERATE AND ABSOLUTE<br>FOR THE INCREASE OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>A vital group can come into being only by a saint who is desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery. A vital group begins with one person. It does not begin with nine or ten persons; it begins with one vital saint. We all need to tell the Lord, "Lord, I want to be that saint, a saint who is desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery."</P><P>Such a saint must be desperate and absolute not merely to be vital; he must be desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery. According to our experience, when we are desperate and absolute for the increase of the church, we have a burden to be vital. If we do not care for the increase but rather are content to see the number in the church remain the same year after year, there is no reason to be vital. We desire to be vital for a purpose, for a goal, and that is for the increase of the Lord's recovery. For this we need to be desperate and we need to be absolute. To be vital we need to begin by taking this matter as life or death. If we take anything as life or death, we are vital in that thing. We need to be desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery; then we will be vital.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUCH A DESPERATE SAINT WOULD SPONTANEOUSLY CONTACT OTHERS BY THE LORD'S LEADING</H2><P>Such a desperate saint would spontaneously contact others by the Lord's leading and gain some companion or companions for him to have a vital group. A vital group cannot be formed by promoting or by giving a message or by exhorting the saints to form vital groups. A vital group can be formed only by a saint who is vital. By the Lord's leading such a vital saint will find some others to be his companions. These will then come together to have intimate and thorough fellowship and begin to vitalize one another. In this way the genuine vital groups will be formed and produced in the church life from within. May the Lord give us this kind of desperation and this kind of absoluteness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THOSE IN THE VITAL GROUPS DEFINITELY<br>AND ABSOLUTELY FULFILLING<br>THE FIRST FOUR BASIC REQUIREMENTS</H2><P>There are four basic requirements that we must take care of in order to become vital and to be sustained in our vitality. We must be definite and absolute to fulfill these requirements.</P>
