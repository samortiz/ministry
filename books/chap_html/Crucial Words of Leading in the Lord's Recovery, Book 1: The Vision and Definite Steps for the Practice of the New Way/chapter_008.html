<h1 class="title">CRUCIAL ASPECTS OF THE HOME MEETINGS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL POINTS REQUIRING OUR ATTENTION<br />
IN THE HOME MEETINGS&mdash;NUTRITION AND HYGIENE</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter, we spoke about dividing the four hundred home meetings in the church in Taipei into a thousand smaller units. On the one hand, I am for this, but on the other hand, I am somewhat concerned about this. If we are not diligent, persistent, and proper in this practice, we will kill everything. Originally, there may be one small group meeting. However, with the division of this meeting into five smaller home meetings, everyone may become lost and the whole group may disband. For this reason I am burdened to share something further in this chapter.</p>
<p>It is a joy to have births. But while there are births, there is also the danger of infant mortality. In the past in China, when hygiene was not properly attended to, the infant mortality rate was high. Around 1945, the average life span of the Chinese was approximately forty years. One of the reasons the life span was so low was that the high infant mortality rate lowered the statistic. The ancient Chinese said, &ldquo;Rare is the man who reaches seventy.&rdquo; Today, however, medical science has advanced so much that the average life span has increased to more than seventy years. The standard of living has also improved. These improvements can be attributed to the advancement in the food supply and hygiene.</p>
<p>My point is that we cannot congratulate ourselves merely with the fact that all the small groups have been subdivided into the homes. Of course, the number is encouraging, but we still need to pay attention to &ldquo;hygiene,&rdquo; &ldquo;medical supplies,&rdquo; and &ldquo;good nutrition.&rdquo; If these things are not in place, our &ldquo;infant mortality rate&rdquo; will still be high. The subdivision will bring in death, not life. I hope that all the elders and co-workers will take note of this danger. If there is malnutrition and lack of hygiene, the death rate will increase. What then should we do? We must approach the problem from a few directions. On the one hand, we need to enhance our hygiene, which includes immunization. On the other hand, we need to pay attention to nutritional care. All the co-workers, elders, and full-time serving ones have a responsibility to look into these two matters. We need to bear the burden of these one thousand home meetings. For this reason, I beg the co-workers and elders to spend much time praying together and seeking the Lord together. Consider the weaknesses and the needs that exist in each home meeting.</p>
<p>After we subdivide the four hundred small groups into a thousand homes, there may be some sloppiness at the beginning, and we may easily become discouraged with the situation. At such times the co-workers, elders, and full-timers should bring in much encouragement. They need to keep the brothers and sisters encouraged. My youngest daughter had a premature delivery when she had her first baby. When the baby was born, he was less than six pounds. The hospital put him in an incubator. When my wife and I visited him, he looked like a pitiful little frog to us. We looked at each other and wondered, &ldquo;Can he live? Will he grow up?&rdquo; However, he is now nine years old. He is not only tall but also strong. He is a member of the football team in school and is even one of its best players. He was able to grow up so well because his mother took good care of him; there was adequate attention given to hygiene and nutrition. He ate well and properly, and the result was healthy and vigorous growth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMFORTING THE DISCOURAGED ONES AND ENCOURAGING THE WEAK ONES</h2>
<p>The most common negative mood that saints fall into is discouragement. This is actually a characteristic of the Christian life. The Chinese are especially susceptible to discouragement. It is strange that in other things the Chinese are aggressive and striving. They can press forward in the midst of all kinds of adversity. The more they suffer, the more they stand up. During the few thousand years of their history, the Chinese were subdued by different races many times, but eventually they absorbed and neutralized their conquerors. The Chinese character is quite indomitable. However, in spiritual things they have a different characteristic. Once they encounter hardship and difficulty, they give up. This is because they think that whatever is of the Lord will be blessed by Him. They also think the Lord&rsquo;s blessing should come without any difficulty because the Lord is omnipotent. This kind of mentality results in much discouragement. Thus, they may think, &ldquo;Since we have turned to the Lord and are living for Him, He will bless us. Since it is of the Lord that we subdivide into the home meetings, He will bless us.&rdquo; On the one hand, this is right, but on the other hand, we cannot be superstitious. This may be compared to planting a crop; we need to do our part to sow. This is also like gardening; we need to plant and water. If we do not sow and water in the right way, we will kill everything.</p>
<p>I once planted a peach tree and a plum tree behind my house, and they both grew well. I decided to trim them myself. My way was to trim them in a neat and tidy way like giving a haircut. Eventually, however, the trees did not bear any fruit. I was quite frustrated. One young American sister, who came periodically to help me, said to me, &ldquo;My father used to trim trees. He told me that the young shoots should not be cut off. It is the young branches that bear the fruit. You have cut off all the young branches and have left behind only the old branches. To be sure, you will not have any fruit.&rdquo; I had cut off the young shoots because I considered them untidy, yet it is these untidy branches that bear fruit. Do not complain that the home meetings are going nowhere. It is possible for us to damage them through our &ldquo;trimming.&rdquo; When this happens, it means that we are not doing things the right way.</p>
<p>Later I learned the lesson concerning trimming fruit trees. Last year my wife and I went to my daughter&rsquo;s house for a rest. For years she had sent me many sweet and juicy plums. When I arrived at her house, I went to her backyard to take a look at her plum trees. They were extremely ugly. All of them looked scruffy and untidy. My daughter said to me, &ldquo;Do not despise these ugly branches. Under their boughs are many fruits.&rdquo; I looked carefully and discovered that indeed all the branches were bent over with fruit. I began to say to myself, &ldquo;Man, do you want fruit, or do you want tidiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dear co-workers and elders, after we divide the small group meetings into the homes, we may expect all the home meetings to be tidy and neat. If they are not tidy and neat, we may want to &ldquo;trim&rdquo; them. But we need to remind ourselves again and again that once we trim them, they are through. We must allow these home meetings to have an opportunity to grow and develop by themselves. If they grow in the wrong way, we should still let them go. They should be free to grow in whatever way they want. As long as the branches remain, they will bear fruit. Do not try to trim them in an artificial way. Do not think that their way will never work. Do not think that since many have been dormant for a long time, something should be done to trim them a little. If we do not trim them, they may still live. Once we trim them, they may die and no longer bear fruit. Our work is not the work of trimming, but of encouragement, help, and stimulation. We need to do these things until they all grow.</p>
