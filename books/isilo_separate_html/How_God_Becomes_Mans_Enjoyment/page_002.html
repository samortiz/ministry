<h1 class="title">A TREE AND A RIVER</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SCRIPTURAL BASIS OF<br />
GOD BECOMING MAN&rsquo;S ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>God being man&rsquo;s enjoyment is related to a tree and a river. Immediately after God created all things and man, the Bible speaks of a tree and a river (Gen. 2:1, 7-10). A tree and a river are again spoken of at the end of the Bible (Rev. 22:1-2). Hence, we may say that everything related to what God is to man and to man&rsquo;s condition before God begins and ends with a tree and a river. God&rsquo;s relationship with man and man&rsquo;s relationship with God depend on a tree and a river.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:8-9 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there He put the man whom He had formed. And out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, as well as the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&rdquo; The tree of life was the central and most important tree in the garden.</p>
<p>After the children of Israel left Egypt, they came to Marah and could not drink the water, for it was bitter. So Moses &ldquo;cried out to Jehovah, and Jehovah showed him a tree; and he cast it into the waters, and the waters became sweet&rdquo; (Exo. 15:23-25).</p>
<p>Song of Songs 2:3 says, &ldquo;As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons: / In his shade I delighted and sat down, / And his fruit was sweet to my taste.&rdquo; This signifies that the Lord Jesus is an apple tree to His lovers; His shade covers them, and His fruit supplies them.</p>
<p>John 15:1 says, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus Christ is God incarnated to be a man. In this verse He said that He is the true vine and that the Father is the husbandman.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:2 says, &ldquo;On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; Here <em>tree</em> is singular. In the New Jerusalem there will not be many trees; there will be one unique tree of life. Verse 19 says, &ldquo;If anyone takes away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this scroll.&rdquo; According to this verse, the tree of life is the greatest blessing in the universe. If anyone takes away from the words of prophecy in the book of Revelation, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city. This indicates that to not enjoy the tree of life is a very serious matter.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Bible, God put man in front of the tree of life. At the end of the Bible, a person&rsquo;s standing before God is related to the tree of life. If we despise the Lord&rsquo;s words and take something away from His words, the blessing of the tree of life will be taken away from us. In contrast, the Lord said, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God&rdquo; (2:7). This shows the importance of the tree of life in the universe.</p>
<p>The river is first spoken of in Genesis: &ldquo;A river went forth from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four branches&rdquo; (2:10). This river went forth from Eden; that is, it went forth from God, for Eden was where God was. This river divided and became four branches, indicating that it had only one source, God, but it flowed in four directions to supply the needs of people in every place.</p>
<p>Psalm 36:8-9 says, &ldquo;They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures. / For with You is the fountain of life.&rdquo; The river of God&rsquo;s pleasures is the river of water of life that flows out from God, the fountain of life.</p>
<p>John 4:14 says, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.&rdquo; This proves that the water of this river is the eternal life of the Lord. Verses 37 through 39 of chapter 7 say, &ldquo;On the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; According to these verses, the Spirit is the unique river that becomes rivers of living water in us.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:1-2 says, &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life.&rdquo; Here the river of water of life is with the tree of life. The Lord promises to give the spring of the water of life to those who thirst (21:6). Furthermore, the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd and guide those who serve Him to springs of waters of life (7:17). The river of water of life is an exceedingly great matter in the universe. God has promised that those who thirst will drink freely of the water of life, and the Shepherd will guide His sheep to the springs of the waters of life for them to drink.</p>
<p>The Bible repeatedly speaks of the wonderful tree of life and the river of water of life. The tree signifies the Lord Jesus, and the river signifies the Spirit. Everything related to our experiencing and enjoying God is included in this tree and this river. There is a hymn that says, &ldquo;The tree the glorious Christ does show... / The river does the Spirit show&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #509). The tree supplies man with food, and the river quenches man&rsquo;s thirst so that he may fully enjoy God. This is the story of God being enjoyed by man.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
