Thy love is so prevailing,<br>E'en Thyself with me to blend!<br>We two one will be for ever;<br>I am Thine and Thou art mine!<br>This will be my testimony:<br>In Thy love we'll ever twine!</blockquote><P>This hymn says that the Lord's love has blended us with Him and made us one with Him. This is the highest plane of love. The real blessing in God's New Testament economy is that Christ has made Himself one with us and has made us one with Him. First Timothy 3:16 speaks of the great mystery of godliness, which is the manifestation of God in the flesh. We are the flesh, yet God made us, the flesh, His expression. The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22b-23). This fullness is Christ's expression. What a wonder it is that God made us men of flesh His expression!</P><P>We have to remember that the Word who was God became flesh (John 1:14) and lived in this flesh for thirty-three and a half years. He died in the flesh (1 Pet. 3:18; Col. 1:22). If He had not died in the flesh, we would have no share in His death. Because He died in the flesh, that indicates He died with us (Gal. 2:20a). He died in union with us. We are the flesh, and He became flesh. This is a part of the history of Christ. His history has become our story. God became a man, and by dispensing Himself into us He made us God-men, men who are one with God, having God within us as our life and nature (Col. 3:4a; 2 Pet. 1:4).</P><P>I thank God that we live in such an age, the age of the great mystery of godliness, the age of God manifesting Himself in our flesh. In this age we do not need to keep the law. We have Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, and Christ today is realized as the life-giving Spirit, the consummated, compounded Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Today we are one with this compound Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Many in today's Christianity still remain in the Old Testament economy. They do not understand the Lord's words in John 14&#151;17, and they do not understand Paul's fourteen Epistles. Furthermore, they do not understand the significance of our being in Christ. We have believed and have been baptized into Christ, and now we are in Him. In Christ everything is okay; outside of Him everything is a mess. We all need to be turned from the human concept of uplifting the law to the divine concept of exalting Christ according to the divine revelation.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_118.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_120.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 119</div><br></body></html>
