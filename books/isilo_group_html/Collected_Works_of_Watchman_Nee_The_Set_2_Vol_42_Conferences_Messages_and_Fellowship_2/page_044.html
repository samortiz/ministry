If we do not have revelation from God to see His will, we will justify things according to our concepts. We will consider that something is reasonable when we think that it is good and justified. As a consequence, we often do not hate what God hates and cannot sympathize with God. We should not despise such a word. If we have not dealt with this matter in a serious way before the Lord, we cannot engage ourselves in His work, because we are not qualified to do so. Even if we have done something, it will not be registered in the heavens. We need to ask God for a thorough and shattering revelation to see what He sees. When our eyes are opened, we will see how evil are the Amalekites; we will not treasure even the best of the sheep, the oxen, or Agag. We will realize that everything that issues from the flesh is useless. If we have not seen the evil of the goodness of the flesh, we have not yet seen God's revelation, and we are still not clear concerning what is spiritual.</p><p>We have listened to so many teachings and have learned so many things. We may agree that the flesh should be removed, but the question is whether or not we truly hate the flesh. We have to know the flesh, and we have to hate it to the extent that we want to kill it. Only then can we say that we have seen the revelation. Sparing the flesh is an expression of the lack of light concerning the flesh. If we see what God sees, we will judge as God judges and reject what God rejects. Ten or twenty years ago when you were still a sinner, did you realize that you were an evil person? No. Not only were you without this realization, but you even boasted with a bold conscience that you were better than your neighbors and that there were few in this world who were as good as you. Today you know that you are a sinner. When others ask if you have sinned, you say yes. But even though you say this with your mouth, you may not realize in your heart how evil you really are. What does it mean to be void of God's light? Being void of God's light is to fail to see what God sees. A man who does not see what God sees is one who is without His light. If you do not know that you are a sinner, you do not have God's light. If someone tells you now that you are without any sin, you will not dare agree with this because you have seen a little of what God sees. You have the light of God, and you readily admit that you have sinned.</p><p>In God's work, cutting away the flesh has much to do with God's light. I am not saying that the goodness of the flesh cannot render man some help. But if we have God's light, we will see that God even rejects the goodness of the flesh. God says that the energy of the flesh, as well as the natural power of attraction, eloquence, ability, and wisdom of the flesh are useless in His work. In God's work we must not stop short of hating the fleshly energy. We must deny the goodness of the flesh in the same way that we deny the weakness of the flesh. Most people know that sin is evil and that it should be removed. But they think secretly in their heart: "Do I have to lay down my wisdom, eloquence, and power too?" Those who ask such questions are void of God's light. I know a few workers of the Lord who are very useful in God's hand. They have all experienced intense light. You may be afraid of God's light, but there are some who are not afraid of it. They want to experience God's intensified enlightening because they realize that even the best of themselves and their flesh is under God's curse and cannot be employed in God's work. How many of us have ever been enlightened by the Lord in such a strong way? We have to pray and ask God to give us a thorough revelation so that we will see what we do not understand. If we know how hopeless we are, we will repent in ashes.</p><h2 class="head1">PAYING ANY PRICE TO OBEY GOD</h2><p>Samuel charged Saul to smite the Amalekites. Samuel was representing God. In 1 Samuel 15:13, Saul said to Samuel, "Blessed be thou of the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the Lord." He thought that he had obeyed in everything. He felt that he had killed the weak sheep, oxen, and all the Amalekites, sparing only the best of the sheep, oxen, and King Agag. He thought that these were inconsequential. My brothers, can there ever be a time when obedience to God is economical? Obedience is not an economical move. Saul thought that it was enough for him to kill the weak sheep, oxen, and the Amalekites, and that his obedience was good and perfect enough. He wanted to save some things. He thought that he had removed all the evil things, that enough of the Amalekites had been killed, and that he had obeyed Jehovah's commandment!</p><p>But in verse 14, Samuel said, "What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?" Saul said that he had fully obeyed the Lord's commandment. But where did the sound of the sheep, the oxen, and Agag come from? Saul was enraged. Those few sheep and oxen were too stupid. They could bleat and low any other time. It is often not up to us when the sheep bleat and the oxen low. They bleat and low at exactly the wrong time. They were innocent! They bleated and lowed at the wrong time! We can imagine the scene. Saul was about to say, "Blessed be thou...," when the sheep bleated and the oxen lowed. He was about to say, "I have performed the commandment of the Lord...," when the sound of the bleating and lowing came again. After he finished his speech, the bleating and lowing cut in again. Then Samuel asked where the sound was coming from. Perfect submission would not have resulted in any noise!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
