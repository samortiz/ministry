   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Negligence regarding the Keeping</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the One Accord in the Lord s Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another great divisive factor in the past has been the negligence regarding the keeping of the one accord in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the elders training in February 1986, my burden was to ask the elders to take care of the one accord in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>More than four hundred brothers signed a letter written to me, assuring me that they would endeavor to keep the one accord see Elders Training, Book 8, The Life-pulse of the Lord s Present Move, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>154-155, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in the past three years of rebellion, a few brothers condemned that letter and even said that a part of that letter is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Two of them wrote to tell me that they would remove their signatures from that letter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows that either they were not clear about the real meaning of the one accord or they despised it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The above-mentioned factors of division hidden in the past are a strong proof that there was a negligence regarding the keeping of the one accord in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The present turmoil among us is not a matter of right or wrong but an issue and a full manifestation of this negligence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This manifestation has progressed to the extent that some of the rebellious ones told people definitely that they will fight until they put me down.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows strongly that they would not care for the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is surely a hidden factor of division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The present turmoil among us did not develop in only one day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ice in a river accumulates over a period of time before it becomes several feet thick.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same way, in our situation there has been a certain amount of accumulation of unpleasant things over a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the beginning I had no realization concerning any opposition or criticism, because I was busy in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when I came back in December 1987 and the brothers came to make certain demands according to their plan, I began to realize that something was terribly wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their plan was actually their conspiracy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In principle, turmoil and problems among the Lord s people come from two sources, a human source and a satanic source.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After observing and considering the situation among us over the past three years, I believe that this turmoil is initiated by Satan, the evil one, the enemy Matt 13:19, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is something from the realm of darkness to destroy the ministry and to shut the door to the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan hates the ministry, and he also hates the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ministry with the new way is the great blockade to the enemy in his evil device, so Satan and the evil spirits moved quite strongly to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a result, some of the brothers were captured and used by the evil spirits to do things which are altogether illogical, unreasonable, and inhuman.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They told people that I am old, I am no longer able to judge things clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All such things show strongly that this turmoil is of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, in spite of the turmoil, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, most of the churches around the globe are still going on positively.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The reports of their present situation, given by their elders who were present in the elders meetings, are quite encouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These reports are printed separately as a book entitled The Present Situation of the Churches in the Recovery throughout the World.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please do your best to obtain a copy from the Living Stream Ministry office, free of charge.</S>
