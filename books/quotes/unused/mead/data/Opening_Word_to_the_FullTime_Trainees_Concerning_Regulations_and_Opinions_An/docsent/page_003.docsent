   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our spiritual life, the divine life, zoe, should grow.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It does not need to grow in God, but it does need to grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Colossians 2:19 says that we need to grow with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The divine life in God Himself is perfect, complete.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is at the highest peak and does not need any growth in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when this life is mingled with our life, this mingled life needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Scripture reading at the beginning of this message are some of the best verses concerning the growth in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3:6 that he planted and Apollos watered but God caused the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to consider what Paul planted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Surely he did not plant the plant life or the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even he did not plant the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He planted the divine life into the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Matthew 13, the human life is the soil in which the Lord sows Himself as the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When any seed of the plant life is sown into the earth, there will be a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The seed mingles with the soil to produce a plant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So when Paul said he planted, this means that he planted the divine life into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once the seed has been planted, there is the need of watering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Watering helps the growth of this life, which is divine, in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians 4:15 tells us that we all need to grow into the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Head is Christ, the One who has the divine life mingled with His human life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Head of the church is not merely the divine person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The divine person alone is not qualified to be the Head of the Body, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This Head needs to be the divine life mingled with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We believers are humans who have received the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have the human life mingled with the divine life, so we are qualified to be the members of the Body of this Head.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now the divine life in us needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The human life in the Lord Jesus grew.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Luke 2 tells us clearly that Jesus grew not in the divine life but in the human life v. 52 . Today we are growing spiritually, not in the human life but in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was growing in the human life, and now we are growing in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this divine life we grow into the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Just by your human life, you are not qualified to have an organic union with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The organic union with the Head depends upon the divine life mingled with your human life by faith and baptism Eph 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By believing and being baptized, we all have been put into this organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this organic union we, who have the human life, received the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The mingling began here.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this mingling we need to grow with the divine life into the Head, and this divine life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Colossians 2:19 says that we grow with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that we grow with the growth of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, we are growing with God as the divine life into the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among today's Christians there is very little talk about such growth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes they might use the word growth, but not according to its biblical denotation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the biblical denotation, our growth in the divine life is to grow with God Himself increasing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God increasing in us means that He is added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way we grow up into the Head in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to see that even this growth needs regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1963 I was invited to speak in Dallas, and I strongly told the people there that we do not need any teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the meeting, a group of people challenged me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They pointed out some verses from the Bible to show that we need teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They did not understand what I meant.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The divine life does not need any teaching, but our human life, in which the divine life is, needs some teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then you may wonder why I told people that we do not need any teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>My point is this: Christianity always teaches people in the human life, while neglecting the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But what we are short of today is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Teaching cannot help you without the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So what you need today, in this sense, is not the teaching but the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I came to this country, I did not minister teaching to people for the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What I ministered all the time was Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christians today are short of the divine life, which is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>So in this sense, you do not need teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You need Christ, the very embodiment of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But in another sense, after you have the divine life, you need teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this message I substitute the word teaching with its synonym regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Regulation actually is the top teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Every teaching regulates you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every teaching which a mother gives to her children is a kind of regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this sense the Bible is full of teaching, full of regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Old Testament, the testament of the law, is full of commandments, and the New Testament is also full of commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even the Lord Jesus said in the Gospel of John that He gave the disciples a new commandment 13:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>John stresses the divine life and also stresses teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That means John stresses regulation.</S>
