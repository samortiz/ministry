This was directly mentioned by the Lord. The strong man dwells in the world. The casting out of demons requires the power of the Holy Spirit. The casting out of demons needs to be done in the name of the Lord, and the Holy Spirit is the power of the name of Jesus. How does one bind the strong man? Indirectly, it is done through the cross of the Lord Jesus. On the cross, the Lord crushed the head of Satan. (Genesis 3:15-Satan's whole body will be dealt with in the millennium. The cross dealt only with Satan's head, removing his power. He attempts to bruise the Lord's heel because the Lord is advancing.) Satan tried to bite the Lord from behind. While the Lord was on earth, Satan could do nothing. But after the Lord ascended, Satan tries his best today to bruise His heel by shaking the believers. After the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension, the Holy Spirit descended to execute what the Lord had accomplished on the cross. With the cross as the base and by the power of the Holy Spirit, we can bind Satan. On our side, we can bind Satan by our prayer out of faith. A great principle of the work is first to bind, and then to plunder. We must bind the strong man by prayer.</P><P>Verse 30:"He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters." Because what is happening today is a positive matter, there are only two sides, with no neutral ground. This is why the Lord spoke this word. " With Me" means "standing on My side"; this refers to position. To "gather" is to gather others together; this refers to work. Not one Christian on this earth should fail to stand on the Lord's side. (Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea were believers who were not absolute for the Lord.) Moreover, not one Christian should fail to gather. It is not right to never bring anyone to the Lord.</P><P>Verse 31:"Therefore I say to you, Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven." Every sin will be forgiven. Sin here particularly refers to one's conduct. Even blasphemy can be forgiven. But blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</P><P>Verse 32:"And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come." What does it mean to blaspheme against the Holy Spirit? To speak against the Holy Spirit is to blaspheme against the Holy Spirit. This is not to cheat the Spirit or to quench the moving of the Spirit. Rather, it is to speak against the Holy Spirit. And what does it mean to speak against the Holy Spirit? This is a sin committed with full awareness. It is not merely to say something by mistake; it is to say clearly that the Holy Spirit is the ruler of the demons. This is not to be against the Spirit in conduct; it is to be against the Spirit in speaking.</P><P>"It will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come." In Questions and Answers on the Gospel (The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, Set 1, Volume 20) we mention five kinds of forgiveness: (1) eternal forgiveness, (2) forgiveness for fellowship, (3) governmental forgiveness, (4) forgiveness through another party, and (5) forgiveness in the millennial kingdom. This age, or the present age, is the age of grace; the age to come is the age of the kingdom. The sin of speaking against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come. The forgiveness in this age is related to the matter of eternal salvation, whereas the forgiveness in the coming age is related to the matter of position in the kingdom.</P><P>Verses 33 through 37 form the fourth subsection.</P><P>Verse 33:"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known." What the Lord meant here is that people can know your heart by looking at your fruit.</P><P>Verse 34:"Offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks." An error in the mouth is preceded by an error in the heart. First the heart has a problem, then the mouth speaks it forth.</P><P>Verse 35:"The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things." The word treasure in the original language implies the way a person keeps valuables in a bank safe-deposit box.</P><P>Verse 36:"And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment." A man's being judged only according to his words would be enough to make him feel that he has no place to hide; he would wish that he could crawl into a hole in the ground. When the Holy Spirit is offended and ceases to work, man does not have any hope of salvation. Therefore, it is more difficult for the rebellious ones to repent than it is for the sinners.</P><P>The reason the Sabbath is placed first in this chapter is to show a change of dispensation. This chapter refers to David because David typifies the Lord. It particularly cites the case of the eating of the bread of the presence to prove that David was rejected by the Israelites. It refers to the priests for the purpose of sin. In the millennium the Israelites will still keep the Sabbath and eat the bread of the presence. When David ate the bread of the presence, God did not acknowledge it as the bread of the presence. There were twelve cakes of the bread of the presence, signifying that the Lord was for the children of Israel and the children of Israel were for the Lord. When David was fleeing, not one of the twelve tribes followed him. Therefore, the bread of the presence was not considered as the bread of the presence. If they had received David, how could the occasion of eating the bread of the presence have happened? Likewise, the question today is not a matter of whether or not one should keep the Sabbath, but a matter of whether or not one cares for the Lord.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
