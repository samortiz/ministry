How can we receive regeneration? In verses 15, 16, 18, and 36, the Lord said, &#8220;That everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life&#8221;; &#8220;that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life"; &#8220;he who believes in Him is not judged&#8221;; &#8220;he who believes in the Son has eternal life.&#8221; These emphatic words spoken repeatedly by the Lord tell us clearly and definitely that the way for us to be saved and regenerated is simply to believe in the Lord. To believe is the only way for us to receive salvation and regeneration. It is absolutely a matter of faith. Regardless of how much we can work or how good our work may be, we cannot be saved and regenerated by our work. Our work does not count in this matter. Only faith counts. Salvation and regeneration must be by faith. It is by faith in the Lord, by believing in the Lord, that we receive forgiveness, the release from God&#8217;s condemnation negatively. It is also by faith, by believing in the Lord, that we receive eternal life, the divine life of God, positively for our regeneration. The Lord has accomplished the redemptive work for us. By His redemptive death on the cross, He has met all of God&#8217;s righteous demands on us and has fulfilled all the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory for us. By His death on the cross in the form of the serpent, the Lord has even destroyed Satan, the devil who usurps us and enslaves us, that we might be delivered from the evil one&#8217;s slavery and power of death (Heb. 2:14). All negative things have been solved by His all-inclusive death on the cross. We do not need to do anything except believe in what the Lord has accomplished. He has dealt with and solved all of our problems. He has left no room for our doing or work. So, there is no need of our work, only of faith in His finished, completed, and all-inclusive redemptive work.<p>After passing through death, by and in resurrection, the Lord has released His life and has become a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Now, in resurrection, He is the Spirit of life (2 Cor. 3:17), with all the virtue of His redemptive work, waiting for us to believe in Him. Once we believe in Him, we not only receive the forgiveness of sins and the deliverance from Satan&#8217;s evil power of darkness, but we also receive the Spirit of life, that is, the Lord Himself, with the eternal life of God. In this way we are saved and regenerated. It is by the way of believing in the Lord with His all-inclusive redemptive work that we receive God&#8217;s life and are born of Him to be His sons.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO BELIEVE</h2><p>To believe in the Lord means to receive Him (John 1:12). The Lord is receivable. He is now the life-giving Spirit, with His complete redemption, waiting for and expecting us to receive Him. Our spirit is the receiving organ. We can receive the Lord&#8217;s Spirit into our spirit by believing in Him. Once we believe in Him, He, as the Spirit, enters into our spirit. Then we are regenerated by Him, the life-giving Spirit, and become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). The phrase &#8220;believes in&#8221; in verses 16, 18, and 36literally translated should be &#8220;believes into.&#8221; When we believe in the Lord, we believe into Him. By believing in Him, we get into Him to be one with Him, to partake of Him, and to participate in all that He has accomplished for us. By believing into Him, we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through, accomplished, attained, and obtained. As we become one with Him by believing into Him, we are saved and regenerated by Him as life. It is by believing into Him that we partake of Him as life and are regenerated in Him.<sup>4</sup><p>If you have not yet received the Lord into you, you can receive Him now. Please pray the following simple prayer:<p>&#8220;Lord Jesus! I am a sinner. I need You. Come into my spirit. Take away my sins. Fill me that I may have the life of God. I receive You right now as my Savior and life. I give myself to You. I ask this in Jesus&#8217; name. Amen!&#8221;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2 class=head1>SOURCE</h2><p><sup>1</sup>Life-study of John, Message One, p. 13.<br><sup>2</sup>Life-study of John, Message Two, p. 25.<br><sup>3</sup>Life-study of John, Message Eight, pp. 91-102.<br><sup>4</sup>Life-study of John, Message Nine, pp. 116-118.<br><p>By Witness Lee, published by Living Stream Ministry.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Gospel of Life &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
