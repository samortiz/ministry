   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR PRACTICE AND EXPOSURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we do not need more teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What we need is practice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all must practice in our daily walk, on our job, in our school, at our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Practice!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Practice burning the incense!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not fear exposure to be exposed is a kind of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The most glorious among the twelve disciples was Peter he was so exposed; the Lord continually put him on the spot.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was so open, so bold, and so stupid.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But that is exactly what the Lord needs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all need to be like that; then we will learn something.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will learn to be right by being wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more mistakes we make, the more we will be corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In any case, exposed or not, almost everyone knows where we are; so why hide?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us put ourselves on the altar and allow the High Priest to divide us joint from marrow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the early years the church in Taipei grew very quickly due mainly to one reason a willingness to be exposed; everybody was willing to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone but yourself knows where you are; you are the only one who does not know your own state.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You need to be exposed, not for others sake, but for your sake.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is so good to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let us practice all the time, practice to burn the incense, not fearing to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us practice individually, in small groups, and in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Practice will make perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not merely go on according to the stage we have already attained.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must learn something ever new and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>LEAVING THE TRADITIONAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we have mentioned already, it is really difficult for any Christian to discover the proper way for Christians to meet this matter is not specifically recorded in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way we have practiced in the past has been more or less traditional; we have either followed the traditions of Christianity or we have instituted traditions of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the past thirty-five or forty years, we who have been in some responsibility among the Lord s children have had a deep conviction that the way we have carried on the meetings is questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a sense, we do not know what is right, but we do know what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not know what we should have, but we do know what we should not have.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Watchman Nee is so bold to say in some of his writings that the so-called fundamental Christian services must be done away with.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said on occasion that such services were just the custom of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the people of Israel were brought into the land of Canaan, God clearly told them that they should not adopt any customs or habits of the nations surrounding them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But eventually they did this very thing: they assimilated many things, not from the law of Moses, not from the teaching of the prophets, but from the practices of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, Brother Nee had the boldness to declare that the modern Christian services do not spring from the teaching of God, but from the custom of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are all well aware of the general arrangement of these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is usually an eleven o clock Sunday morning service, set at that hour so that everyone may have an opportunity to sleep late.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the church-goers arrive for the time of worship ; but what is called the worship service is almost a period of entertainment and relaxation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The burden of responsibility falls upon the hired pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The men of the congregation have been working in their offices, and the women have been laboring at home; therefore, this is the time, they say, for the pastor to do his job.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The pastor preaches and the choir, led by the director of music, sings to the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If any of the pew members are asked to function, with few exceptions they will say that this is not their job, but the pastor s. I am not being critical, but just presenting the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Praise the Lord for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a recovery of being in the spirit and on the ground of the church, but it is something more.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be in the spirit and on the proper ground are vital, but these are only preparatory to burning the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the center of God s dwelling place on this earth is the altar of incense.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The goal of the entire service within the sphere of the tabernacle is the burning of the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must have the burning of the incense in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have seen that it is the priesthood, the corporate body of the priests, that burns the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Who are the priests?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The hired pastors, the director of music, the choir, and the soloists?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I believe we are clear that we are all the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>TAKING UP THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To burn the incense we need the priesthood and we need the sphere of the priestly ministry, the proper tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The practical expression of the tabernacle today is undoubtedly the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no other way to interpret the typology.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we do not have the local church, we cannot have the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As the people of God, we need such a tabernacle to worship and to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Praise the Lord for His recovery of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now in this country we do have some genuine local churches, we do have the reality of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whether this tabernacle is up to standard or not is another matter we leave that for the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In any case, we do have the local tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If it were only universal, we could not touch it; it must be local.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Just the tabernacle alone, however, is useless: We must have the tabernacle with the priesthood, and since we are the priesthood, we all must learn to function.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brothers, you must function.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Sisters, you must function.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If I could, I would be a troublemaker to every one of you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I would give you no rest until every one of you learns to function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is really difficult to be delivered from anything traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I know your habit of looking at the ceiling or looking around at the walls in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You may say that you are more for God than that you do not look around or care for the adornment of others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You care for the Lord, but in a silent way, waiting for either the pastor, the responsible brothers, or the full-time workers to do their job.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Am I right?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the traditional way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>So many take this for granted as normal and proper, but we are bold to say that it is one hundred percent wrong, one hundred percent according to tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I challenge anyone to find a verse in the Bible saying that when we come together as Christians we must be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>On the other hand, we have this word, Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, mentioned seven times in the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Who taught you to be so silent?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You must not bring your traditions into the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For years we have been seeking a way to help all the Lord s children function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I do believe the Lord has begun to show us the way by the corporate pray-reading and praise-reading of His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am not predicting, but I have a deep conviction that there is yet something new awaiting us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In any case, the principle is this: we all must learn to function.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Do not still be controlled by the traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>May the Lord be merciful to fully recover us.</S>
