   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To the Fourth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may think that the ordinances in 23:12 and 13 are concerned with man s relationship with God instead of man s relationship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt, the fourth commandment, concerning keeping the Sabbath, is related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the details concerning this commandment in 23:12 and 13 are related to man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 12 says, Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we see that keeping the Sabbath day not only involves our relationship with God, but involves our relationship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An Israelite was to observe the Sabbath so that the son of his handmaid and the strangers might rest and be refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the keeping of the Sabbath is related to the Lord and to slaves and strangers as well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, according to this verse, God even cares that the ox and the ass have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Again we see the sweetness of God s ordinances!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God even takes care of donkeys and oxen!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, keeping the Sabbath is related both to man and beast.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God cares that man and beast may rest and be refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Supplements to the Law 1.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning a Maidservant</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapters twenty-one through twenty-three we also have supplements to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 21:7-11 there is a supplementary portion concerning maidservants.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Concerning Stealing a Man</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Exodus 21:16 says, He that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have pointed out that this ordinance is inserted between two verses which speak respectively of smiting one s parents and cursing them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the reason for this insertion?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In ancient times the purpose of kidnapping was selling into slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It may be that those who would steal people for the purpose of selling them were also those who did not honor their own parents.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that someone who kidnaps a person is also one who does not honor his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Smiting parents, cursing parents, and stealing a person were all crimes worthy of death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The deeds differ, but the consequences are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who smite their parents or curse them and those who kidnap people lack human affection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why would someone smite his parents or curse them?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Simply because he has no human affection for them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Likewise, a person who steals another is devoid of human affection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is especially proved when we consider the fact that in ancient times it was mainly children who were kidnapped.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anyone who does such a thing is a person without human affection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This may be the reason that the ordinance concerning kidnapping is inserted between two ordinances related to honoring parents.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Concerning Damage Caused</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>to Cattle and by Cattle</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 21:33-36 there are ordinances concerning damage caused to cattle and by cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, there is an ordinance related to an ox falling into an open pit and also about an ox that hurts another ox.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Concerning Strangers, Widows,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Orphans, and the Poor</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Exodus 22:21 says, Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verses 22 through 24 there is an ordinance concerning widows and orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 22 says, Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to 22:25-27, an Israelite was not to be a usurer with respect to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 25 says, If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All these ordinances are filled with sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The spirit of God s law is tender and touching, full of care for strangers, widows, orphans, and the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Exodus 23:9 says concerning strangers, Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If I had been a stranger among the children of Israel, I would have been deeply touched by such an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I may have wept out of the sense of sweetness and tenderness pervading God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A stranger may have said, Even though I am far from my native land and am a stranger among these people, there is even an ordinance which cares for me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How sweet!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The ordinances concerning widows, orphans, and the poor are also deeply touching.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Concerning Helping the Enemy</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we have pointed out, in 23:4 and 5 there are ordinances concerning helping one s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is an especially good example of the sweetness of God s law.</S>
