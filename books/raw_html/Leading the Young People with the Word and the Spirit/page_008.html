         <h2 class="head2">Creating Life from the Lower Forms<br />
to Higher Forms</h2>
<p>God first created the lower forms of life and then the higher forms. His creation began with plant life, which is the lowest form of life. Then He created the animal life and then man&rsquo;s life, which is the highest form of life. Plant life has no consciousness. Of the created forms of life with consciousness, God began with organisms that have the lowest form of consciousness, that is, the animals in the water. Then He created the animals in the air and the animals on the ground (1:11, 21, 25). In principle, animals on the ground have a higher degree of consciousness than those in the air. Following the creation of the animals on the ground, God created man (vv. 26-27). Man has the highest form of consciousness and sense among all of God&rsquo;s creation, whether in the sphere of water, air, or land. Among all the created organisms, except for angels, man&rsquo;s consciousness and senses are the highest. Nevertheless, Genesis 2 shows that God was not satisfied that man would have only the created life; He wanted man to receive the uncreated divine life, the highest life in the universe, which is God&rsquo;s life. Hence, after creating man, God placed him before the tree of life so that man would receive this life (v. 9). From this we can see that life is the content and the goal in God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD AS LIFE</h2>
<p>We must tell the young people that God is life. In the Bible there are many verses that speak of God being life. Psalm 36:9 says that God is the fountain of life. The Gospel of John begins by saying, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1), but then it says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (v. 4). In 10:10 the Lord said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&rdquo; Colossians 3 says, &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo; (v. 4). First John 5:11-12 says, &ldquo;God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; In chapter 22 of Revelation, which is the last book of the Bible, the tree of life and the river of water of life are mentioned again (vv. 1-2). All these verses show that God emphasizes life, that God Himself is life, and that God desires to give us eternal life.</p>
<p>The matter of God being life requires a change in our natural concept, because the first thought of most people about God is not related to life. The first thought of both Christians and non-Christians concerning God is not related to God being life. Some think of God as being the sovereign One, others of God as the Creator, and still others as the almighty One, but rarely do they think of God as life. Even theologians do not place much emphasis on the matter of God being life. Most tell people that God is mighty, holy, compassionate, righteous, and so forth. Rarely in Christianity is there a message emphasizing that God is life. Nevertheless, the Bible reveals that God is life. According to the record in the Bible, after God created man, the first thing that He did was to place man in front of the tree of life in the garden of Eden (Gen. 2:8-9). The first impression God gave to man of Himself was not related to power, holiness, love, or righteousness but to life.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2, after God created man, He did not speak to man of His power or His love; rather, He placed man in front of the tree of life in the garden of Eden. This shows that God is life to man. When I saw this, I had a great inward turn. Formerly, I thought of God as a great God, but on that day I became clear that God is life to us. Even though He is great, He became a tree of life with fruit for us to eat. In the New Testament many people viewed the Lord Jesus as a person of great power because He performed many miracles, such as changing water to wine and even raising people from the dead. However, the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (John 6:35), and He likened Himself to the children&rsquo;s bread (Matt. 15:26). This reveals that God is life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Flowing Out to Be Man&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>God is not only life, but He also longs to be our life. However, in order to be our life, He had to come forth to be our life and to be gained by us. The Bible shows that the coming forth of God is a matter of flowing. The first step in His flowing out was in the Lord Jesus. The second step of His flowing out is as the life-giving Spirit. The flowing out of God in the Lord Jesus may not be obvious to us. However, we can clearly see that the Spirit is the flowing out of God. In the Old Testament, when Moses struck the rock, living water flowed out of the rock. The flowing out of the living water is a type of the Spirit (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). John 7:38-39 also says that rivers of living water will flow out of the innermost being of those who believe into the Lord and that the Spirit is this living water. Hence, the Spirit is the flowing out of God, the ultimate means of God flowing into man.</p>
<p>God became flesh in the incarnation of the Lord Jesus, and then He became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection (1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b). His &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; in these two steps was for the purpose of flowing out in order to be received into us. This is seen at the conclusion of the Bible. Revelation 22:1-2 says, &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits.&rdquo; Both the living water that flows out of the throne and the tree of life are God, because the tree of life is the Lord Jesus and the water of life is the Spirit. The picture at the end of Revelation shows that God is flowing out to be our life. He is the tree of life full of fruits for us to eat; He is also the gushing water of life for us to drink. Because He is flowing out, we can take Him into us to be our life.</p>
<p>If the Lord Jesus had not become the life-giving Spirit, it would not be possible for us to receive Him. After becoming flesh and then becoming the life-giving Spirit, God is available to be received by us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
