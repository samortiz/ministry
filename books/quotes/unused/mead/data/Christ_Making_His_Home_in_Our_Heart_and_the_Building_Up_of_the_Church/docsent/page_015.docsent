   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD BEING MANIFESTED IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we may not necessarily feel that the Holy Spirit is in us, if there is a change in our environment or we suffer persecution, the Spirit in us will come forth, and the Lord will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This proves to the world that God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit who is in us is the Triune God in us, and nothing can shake, overcome, or subdue Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The numerous stories of martyrs prove that God was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When their environment was difficult, the God who was in them was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nothing can change this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There were believers in China who experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A brother once testified that his believing in the Lord was not the result of hearing the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His salvation was the result of an event that he witnessed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the Boxer Rebellion, he was a young apprentice in a shop in Beijing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day the atmosphere in the street was very tense, and all the shops closed their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He stayed inside the shop and watched through a crack in the door.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He saw the Boxers parading in the street as they sent the believers of Jesus to an execution ground.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Boxers were brandishing their swords and knives in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was a frightening scene.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among those who were being paraded to execution was a young lady about twenty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She was a Christian and had been arrested by the Boxers because of her faith in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This woman showed no fear; she was even singing and praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That scene made a deep impression on the young apprentice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He felt that there must be something special about Christians; otherwise, how could this woman sing and rejoice instead of fearing death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of the impression this incident left in him, when he later met a Christian in northeast China, he heard a clear word concerning the Lord s salvation and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later he became a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the way God is mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When our environment becomes difficult or we are persecuted, God is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When there is no persecution, we can all pray and read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, when persecution comes, the genuine Christians are set apart from the false ones, because God is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BEING IN THE LORD,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>HAVING THE LORD S MANIFESTATION,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>AND THE LORD MAKING AN ABODE WITH US</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s salvation is the Triune God being mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day you were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since that day the Lord has been in you, and you have been in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, that is not the end. The Lord said, He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him John 14:21 . Then He said, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him v. 23 . We know that the Lord is in us, and that we are in the Lord, but we need to ask whether we have the Lord s manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is one thing to have the Lord in us, it is another thing to have the Lord manifest Himself to us, and it is still another thing for the Lord to come to make an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are all saved, and the Lord is in us, but does the Lord manifest Himself to us every day?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Is the Lord making His abode with us?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our being in the Lord is different from the Lord s manifesting Himself to us, which is also different from His making an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we believed, we entered into the Lord, but how can we abide in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We abide in the Lord by loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By believing in the Lord, we are in Him; by loving Him, we abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We love the Lord by obeying Him and keeping His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who keep the Lord s commandments are those who love Him, and the Lord will manifest Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, He will make an abode with them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After we receive God s salvation, we should have the Lord s manifestation continually.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have the Lord in us, and we are in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is to receive God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Afterward, we should have the Lord s manifestation continually, and He should make an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the living of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a living is the issue of our loving the Lord, keeping His commandments, and obeying Him.</S>
