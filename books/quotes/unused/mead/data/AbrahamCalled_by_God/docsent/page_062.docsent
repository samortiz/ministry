   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>14 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD COMMUNION WITH GOD ON THE HUMAN LEVEL And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, and said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 18:1-3 And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness"; and he was called the friend of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>James 2:23</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we come to Genesis 18, which contains an intimate record of Abraham's experience with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we take an overall view of Abraham's experience with God as found in chapter eleven through chapter twenty-four, we shall see that his experience is in four major sections.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Firstly, while he was living in the demonic land of Chaldea, he was called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suddenly, much to his surprise, the God of glory appeared to him Acts 7:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That was the beginning of his experience with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Secondly, in chapters twelve through fourteen, Abraham experienced living by faith in God for his existence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He had been called by God for the fulfillment of God's divine purpose, but, as a human being, he still had to have food, protection, and all that was necessary to maintain his existence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was a stranger in a new land, having no property of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, God trained him to exercise the very faith which God had infused into him to trust in God for his existence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Following that, in chapters fifteen through seventeen, the third section, God trained him to know grace for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here Abraham learned not to do anything by himself or on his own but to do everything by and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although God needed him, God did not need anything of him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All that Abraham had, was, and could do was absolutely repudiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God spent at least fifteen years to train Abraham in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For thirteen years, God disappeared from him because he did not behave himself properly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abraham was trained, disciplined, and very much in God's favor, but he did not walk in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, he walked in the presence of his wife, the one who proposed that he exercise his flesh to produce a seed for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Abraham expected that Ishmael, his seed, could fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, God seemed to say, "No, I don't approve of Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the issue of your effort, the produce of your doing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I reject him and you must not keep him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abram, you must learn that nothing that you can do means anything to Me. I only need you, not your ability and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I don't need your Lot, Eliezer, Hagar, or anything of you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must walk before Me, not doing anything by yourself or on your own.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must be nourished and supplied by the sufficiency of My divine udder.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then you will be able to produce something not only for Me but also of Me. I only accept and approve what is out of Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I shall not produce an Isaac without you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I shall produce an Isaac through you, but not out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You are My channel, not the source.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever you consider yourself to be the source, you insult Me. I am the unique, all-sufficient source.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You have known Me as the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now you must know Me as El-Shaddai, as the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Stay under My udder and be supplied and nourished constantly by My all-sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the way to walk before Me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As Abraham learned to know grace for the fulfillment of God's purpose, God changed him in both name and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God changed Abraham's constitution by having him circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Abram was terminated and Abraham came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the third major section of Abraham's experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Immediately after this, he was ushered into a glorious section living in fellowship with God 18:1 24:67 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Abraham had been called, had learned to live by faith in God for his existence, and had come to know grace for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now he has been brought into constant fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fourth section of his experience is found in chapters eighteen through twenty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everything revealed in these seven chapters is an aspect of Abraham's intimate fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the first section of his experience, God appeared to Abraham as the God of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the second section He revealed Himself as the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the third section He came to Abraham as El-Shaddai, as the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the fourth section God came in a very different way as a mortal man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As Abraham sat in the door of his tent during the heat of the day, he saw three mortal men approaching vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Hebrew, the word translated "men" in verse 2 means mortal men, human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God appeared to Abraham in such a form.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At first, Abraham did not realize that one of these men was the Lord, Jehovah, and that the other two were angels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of these forms of God's appearing as the God of glory, as the Most High God, as El-Shaddai, and as a mortal man which do you prefer?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do you prefer that God appear to you as the God of glory?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If He did, you would be terrified.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Would you like Him to come as the Most High God?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the president of the United States were to come to me and say, "I am the most high president of the United States coming to visit a little man," I would feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if he were to come as a man the same as me, I would say, "Sir, how are you?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Please come in and rest and be refreshed."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If he were to come in this way, revealing later that he was the president of the United States, I could have a very good time with him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Of these four ways of God's appearing, I prefer that He come to me in the form of a mortal man, not in His divine glory, in His most high position, nor in His all-sufficiency.</S>
