<p>I have been with many of you brothers in the English-speaking world for over twenty-two years. Truthfully speaking, many of you are still under a kind of ignorance. What you do, what you say, and how you take care of the churches, indicates that you are short of the vision that I have seen and that the Lord has been speaking to us for the past twenty-two years. I am especially regretful that it is as if some of you have never heard the messages given in the elders&rsquo; training of 1984. What a revelation was in those messages! Since those messages were delivered, though, has there ever been a change in you? Has there been a change in your being, in your service, and in your taking care of the church? According to my observation, there has not been much change. That training of twelve days with three messages each day may have become a vanity to some of you. In those messages the New Testament ministry, the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the way to carry out the vision, and other crucial matters concerning the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery were stressed very much. One strong point in these messages is that the elders should not control the church. Even after that fellowship, in some churches, stronger control was exercised. This is a shame. The more the Lord in His ministry tells us not to control the church, the more control is exercised by some. This is a cause for much suffering, and this is a proof that those messages were not effective for some.</p>
<p>To control the saints is a shame. If you control a church you will suffer spiritual death. History testifies to this. You cannot control God&rsquo;s people. The Holy Spirit would not allow you to do such a thing. Even the spirits within the saints would not allow this. The leading ones are slaves. In the Life-study of Matthew I told the sisters who are the wives of the elders to consider themselves as the wives of slaves. Although I gave such a strong word in 1976, many went back afterwards to be nearly the kings in their locality. Paul, in his ministry, considered himself as a slave. In 2 Corinthians 4:5 he said, &ldquo;For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not control the churches. I simply speak the word of God. I do not have the intention to control anyone, but I do have a burden to release the holy Word. Because of this, so many of the saints listen to me. You may try to get people to listen to you, but the more you do this the more they will go away from you. Whether or not the saints would listen to you depends upon how much you could minister to them. You are here because you received the help from the ministry of the holy Word, but regrettably you only received the help according to your taste. You did not take the ministry that comes from the Lord absolutely. As a result, you have suffered. You should pray, &ldquo;Lord, help me to take my hands off. I would go back only to serve your flock as a slave. I would not control anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The holy Word is more than clear on this matter. In Matthew 23:8-11, the Lord told the disciples, &ldquo;But you, do not be called Rabbi; for one is your Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone your father on the earth; for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens. Neither be called leaders, because One is your Leader, the Christ. And the greater among you shall be your servant.&rdquo; Because of these verses, some brothers in England in the last century picked up the term brethren. First Peter 5:3 says to the elders, &ldquo;Nor as lording it over the allotments, but becoming patterns of the flock.&rdquo; The elders must set themselves up as an example. Labor to be an example. If there is the need of cleaning, you have to do the cleaning first. If there is the need of vacuuming, you have to do the vacuuming first. If there is the need of cleaning the restroom, you have to do it as a pattern. You should not sit on a throne giving orders, ruling others. This is absolutely wrong. There is not such a thing as a &ldquo;local headship.&rdquo; The only headship in the church is the heavenly headship.</p>
<p>When some referred to me as an elder or an apostle, this was an insult to me. I am just a small man, without fame, without degree, trying the best to be a slave to serve not only the saints but also the sinners by ministering the Word which the Lord has opened up to me. Many of the brothers can testify for me that I never exercised any kind of authority to control anyone. Do not think that I am deaf or I am blind to the problems in the churches. I have a lot of feeling concerning all the churches, but I would never control the churches or say anything to control them. Whenever I hear something concerning some problems in the churches my practice is to pray for them.</p>
<p>I exhort all of you brothers not to control the church you are caring for. If possible, some of you should resign from the eldership. In the Bible there is a way for the appointing ones to deal with the wrong elders (1 Tim. 5:19-20). This is very rarely done because we do not believe in controlling, and we do not believe in adjusting. I only believe in the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace and in His holy Word moving in you by His gracious Spirit. This is all that I trust in. I trust in His mercy, His grace, the Word, and the Spirit. I do not like to control anything, to adjust anything, or to direct anything, but I like to pray for you to receive mercy, grace, the Word, and the Spirit. I do have a full trust in these four things, but it depends upon your attitude. Will you receive the mercy? Will you receive the grace? Will you receive the Word in an absolute way and not according to your choice, to your taste, to your preference, or to your priority? Just receive His mercy, His grace, and His Word absolutely and His Spirit unconditionally.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE MINISTRY&mdash;<br />
GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY IN FAITH</h2>
<p>In the elders&rsquo; training of 1984 we spoke strongly concerning the unique ministry of the New Testament. However, in the time since then some have endeavored to teach something different, to carry out something that differs from the unique ministry. In 1 Timothy 1 Paul says, &ldquo;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently.&rdquo; To teach differently mainly does not refer to heresy. Rather it refers to the Old Testament things, such as the law and the genealogies (1 Tim. 1:4, 7). These are the things which are different from the testimony of Jesus and from God&rsquo;s economy. This economy of God is not by any feeling or by an outward seeing. It is by faith.</p>
<p>Faith is a term that concerns the entire New Testament. Galatians 3:23-25 says that before faith came we were under law. Now that faith is come, we are no longer under the law. We have received the Holy Spirit not by an outward work, but by the hearing of faith (Gal. 3:2). Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith (Eph. 3:17) not through our feelings. Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4:13 that he spoke by the spirit of faith. In the following chapter he said that we walk not by appearance, not by anything seen or felt, but by faith (2 Cor. 5:7). Regeneration is not something you can see. Sanctification is not something that you can see. Transformation is not something you can see. Can you see the conformity to Christ&rsquo;s death? Probably the only thing that people will see will be our glorification. We all will be in glory; then all will see. But before that consummating item of God&rsquo;s salvation, nothing is visible. Nothing is by sight. Everything is by faith. Often when we quote Ephesians 3:17 and 1 Timothy 1:4, we do not include the words through faith or in faith.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 6:4-5 Paul said that we have become &ldquo;partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age.&rdquo; God has given us a foretaste of the things of the coming age, and many of the things of the coming age will be by sight, not by faith. When the millennium comes, there will be a great restoration (Isa. 11:6-9, 35:5-10; 65:25). But today all the bequests of the New Testament blessings are by faith, not by sight. In last year&rsquo;s elders&rsquo; training, this was stressed very much. But it seems that in the months since that time this word has become a vanity to some of you.</p>
<p>At that time the entire vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was presented to you concerning God, concerning Christ, concerning the Spirit, concerning the believers, concerning the church, concerning the kingdom, and concerning the New Jerusalem. According to my observation nearly all of the elders labor quite much, but in your labor you do not care much for the vision.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 05: Fellowship Concerning the Lord's Up-to-Date Move &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
