   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the spiritual experience of believers, there are many people who can serve as examples of being entangled in the "organization," both those with form and those without, until they have damaged their own life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the start a servant of God receives the power of the spirit, and God greatly works.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many are saved and edified.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then there has to be a kind of "organization" or "method" to preserve the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of needs, requests, and maybe even commands, the servant will have to do the labor of "nourishing."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consequently, he is bound by the environment and can no longer follow the Holy Spirit freely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His spirit's life gradually recedes, but the outward work with organization still continues very prosperously.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the story of failure for many persons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today among spiritual works there is a distressing situation in which the worker considers his work to be a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people often say, "I am so busy with things and with work that I have only a little time for fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope that I will have an opportunity to stop the work temporarily to have a time for some spiritual nurturing, and then I will come back to work."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is really dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our work must be the result of the fellowship of our spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the work must be a joy; it must all be the overflow of the life of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the work becomes a tiresome thing, separating the life of the spirit from the Lord Jesus, then this work must be stopped immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since the flow of the Holy Spirit has changed course, one must find out where it is and follow it there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Holy Spirit's stopping of our work is very different from Satan's blocking of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet people often confuse the two.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God has said to stop and the believer still continues, then he will fall from working by the spirit to using his own mental power, ability, and effort as support.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though he may resist the enemy, there is no anointing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He cannot overcome because this battle is actually false.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As soon as a believer sees that there is a blockage in the nature of the spirit, then he should discern whether in fact this comes from God or from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the blockage is from the enemy, then he can resist the enemy in the spirit and go forward together with God through prayer, releasing his own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If this is not the case, God will cause the believer's spirit to be more oppressed and to feel heavy laden and without freedom if he goes forward.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, at the present time the servants of God must get rid of all the work which God has not given, the work which he should have left long ago, the monopolizing work, the work which does not come from the Holy Spirit, the work which suppresses the spirit, the work which causes the believer to depart from the spirit, and the work which may be good, but which keeps the believer from being more noble.</S>
