   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE QUESTION OF FINANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a remarkable fact that, while the book of Acts supplies many minute details regarding the work of an apostle, the one subject which from a human standpoint is of paramount importance in the carrying on of any work is not dealt with at all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No information whatever is given as to how the needs of the work or the personal needs of the workers were supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is certainly amazing!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What men consider of supreme importance, the apostles regarded of least consequence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the early days of the Church, God's sent ones went out under the constraint of divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their work was not just their profession, and their faith in God was not intellectual, but spiritual; not just theoretical, but intensely practical.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The love and the faithfulness of God were realities to them, and that being so, no question arose in their minds concerning the supply of their temporal needs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today as then, the matter of finance will present no problems to those who have a vital faith in God and a real love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This question of finance has most important issues, so let us devote a little time to it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In grace God is the greatest power, but in the world mammon is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If God's servants do not clearly settle the question of finance, then they leave a vast number of other questions unsettled too.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once the financial problem is solved, it is amazing how many other problems are automatically solved with it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The attitude of Christian workers to financial matters will be a fairly good indication as to whether or not they have been commissioned of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the work is of God, it will be spiritual; and if the work is spiritual, the way of supply will be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If supplies are not on a spiritual plane, then the work itself will speedily drift on to the plane of secular business.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If spirituality does not characterize the financial side of the work, then the spirituality of its other departments is merely theoretical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no feature of the work that touches practical issues as truly as its finance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can be theoretical in any other department, but not in that one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LIFE OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every worker, no matter what his ministry, must exercise faith for the meeting of all his personal needs and all the needs of his work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In God's Word we read of no worker asking for, or receiving, a salary for his services.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul made no contract with the church in Ephesus, or with any other church, that he should receive a certain remuneration for a certain period of service.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That God's servants should look to human sources for the supply of their needs has no precedent in Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do read there of a Balaam who sought to make merchandise of his gift of prophecy, but he is denounced in no uncertain terms.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We read also of a Gehazi who sought to make gain of the grace of God, but he was stricken with leprosy for his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No servant of God should look to any human agency, whether an individual or a society, for the meeting of his temporal needs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they can be met by the labor of his own hands, or from a private income, well and good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, he should be directly dependent on God alone for their supply, as were the early apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The twelve apostles sent out by the Lord had no fixed salary, nor had any of the apostles sent out by the Spirit; they simply looked to the Lord to meet all their requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The apostles of today, like those of the early days, should regard no man as their employer, but should trust Him who has sent them forth to bear the responsibility of all that the doing of His will involves, in temporal as well as spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a man can trust God, let him go out and work for Him; if not, let him stay at home, for he lacks the first qualification for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is an idea prevalent that if a worker has a settled income he can be more at leisure for the work, and consequently will do it better; but as a matter of fact, in spiritual work there is need for an unsettled income, because that necessitates intimate fellowship with God, constant clear revelation of His will, and direct divine support.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In worldly business, all a worker needs by way of equipment is will and talent; but human zeal and natural gift are no equipment for spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Utter dependence on God is necessary if the work is to be according to His will; therefore, God wishes His workers to be cast on Him alone for financial supplies, so that they cannot but walk in close communion with Him and learn to trust Him continually.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A settled income does not foster trust in God and fellowship with Him; but utter dependence on Him for the meeting of one's needs certainly does.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more unsettled a worker's living is, the more he will be cast on God; and the more an attitude of trustful dependence on God is cultivated, the more spiritual the work will be.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So it is clear that the nature of the work and the source of its supply are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a worker receives a definite salary from man, the work produced can never be purely divine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Faith is a most important factor in God's service, for without it there can be no truly spiritual work; but our faith requires training and strengthening, and material needs are a means used in God's hand toward that end. We may profess to have faith in God for a vast variety of intangible things, and we may deceive ourselves into believing we really trust Him when we have no trust at all, simply because there is nothing concrete to demonstrate our distrust.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when it comes to financial needs, the matter is so practical that the reality of our faith is put to the test at once.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we cannot trust God to supply our temporal needs, then we cannot trust Him to supply our spiritual needs; but if we truly prove His trustworthiness in the very practical realm of material wants, we shall be able also to trust Him when spiritual difficulties arise either in connection with the work or with our personal lives.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What a contradiction it is if we proclaim to others that God is the living God, yet we ourselves dare not trust Him for the meeting of our material needs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Further, he who holds the purse holds authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are supported by men, our work will be controlled by men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is only to be expected that if we receive an income from a certain source, we should have to account for our doings to such a source.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever our trust is in men, our work cannot but be influenced by men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a serious misconception to fancy that we can take money from men to do the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are supported by men, then we must seek to please men, and it is often impossible at the same time both to please men and God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In His own work God must have the sole direction.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That is why He wishes us to depend on no human source for financial supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many of us have experienced that again and again God has controlled us through money matters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we have been in the center of His will, supplies have been sure, but as soon as we have been out of vital touch with Him, they have been uncertain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At times we have fancied God would have us do a certain thing, but He has showed us it was not His will by withholding financial supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So we have been under the constant direction of the Lord, and such direction is most precious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we cease to be dependent on Him, how can our trust be developed?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The first question anyone should face who believes himself truly called of God is the financial question.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If he cannot look to the Lord alone for the meeting of his daily wants, then he is not qualified to be engaged in His work, for if he is not financially independent of men, the work cannot be independent of men either.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If he cannot trust God for the supply of needed funds, can he trust Him in all the problems and difficulties of the work?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are utterly dependent on God for our supplies, then we are responsible to Him alone for our work, and in that case it need not come under human direction.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May I advise all who are not prepared for the walk of faith, to continue with their secular duties and not engage in spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every worker for God must be able to trust Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we have real faith in God, then we have to bear all the responsibility of our own needs and the needs of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must not secretly hope for help from some human source.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must have faith in God alone, not in God plus man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the brethren show their love, let us thank God, but if they do not, let us thank Him still.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is a shameful thing for a servant of God to have one eye on Him and one eye on man or circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is unworthy of any Christian worker to profess to trust in God and yet hope for help from other sources.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is sheer unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have constantly said, and say it again, that as soon as our eyes turn to the brethren, we bring disgrace on our fellow workers and on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our living by faith must be absolutely real, and not deteriorate into a "living by charity."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We dare to be utterly independent of men in financial matters, because we dare to believe utterly in God; we dare to cast away all hope in them, because we have full confidence in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If our hope is in men, then when their resources dry up, ours will dry up too.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have no board behind us, but we have a Rock beneath us; and no one standing on this Rock will ever be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Men and circumstances may change, but we shall carry on in a steady course if our reliance is on God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All the silver and the gold are His, and none who walk in His will can ever come to want.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We are apt to trust in the children of the Lord who in bygone days have sent us gifts, but they will all pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must keep our eyes fixed on the unchanging God whose grace and faithfulness continue forever.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The two initial steps in the work of God are first, the prayer of faith for needed funds, then the actual undertaking of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today, alas! many of God's servants have no faith; yet they seek to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They undertake the work without having the essential qualification for it; therefore, what they do has no spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Faith is the first essential in any work for God, and it should be exercised in relation to material as well as other needs.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If there is no faith for funds, then no matter how good the work is, sooner or later it will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When money stops, the work will stop too.</S>
