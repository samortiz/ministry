   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUTURE OUTLOOK The Need for Changing the System</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In any event, the conclusion from our fellowship was first that the Lord's recovery has spread.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Up to the present time, the number of people among us has not been huge, but without a doubt, the Lord's recovery has reached all of the major languages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our literature has been translated into almost twenty languages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may say that our publications can be found in every major language.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Also, on the six continents on the earth, there are over six hundred churches in the Lord's recovery as our fields of labor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The truths and the fields for our labor are the factors of blessing in our advancement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consider Taipei as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The entire city of Taipei is our work place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Already there are twenty-one meeting halls, and the number attending the meetings is about three to four thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, though there are so many people, they have not been able to function nor have they been fully put to use.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is because our system has been faulty, causing the brothers and sisters to be limited in their usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may use a country as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To have a strong country there needs to be a strong public educational system.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the educational system in the country is not sufficiently strong and widespread, then the country will have a difficult time forging ahead since it will not be able to produce talented people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, in Taipei there was a change in the system.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything was rearranged to open up a new atmosphere so that every place could become a workplace and a place of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regrettably, there have not been enough people to meet the need of this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because even though there are many people in the church, not many have been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was our mistake in the past, an error in our direction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, suppose there were some brothers who had begun meeting with us in 1949.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time they were still single.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thirty years have since passed, and even their children have grown and now have a college education; some are even married.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, these brothers, meeting week by week, listening to messages continuously for thirty years, have not yet graduated from spiritual elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows us that if a person gets saved and begins to go to the meeting hall to listen to the preaching of the word, after one year, he may feel he has gotten something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, after another year of listening, he may feel about the same; after ten or fifteen years, he will still feel almost the same.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even after hearing messages for twenty or thirty years, he will still be about the same.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seems that he understands addition, he has heard about subtraction, and he has also heard about algebra, geometry, and calculus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet when the time comes to apply what he has heard, he cannot add, subtract, multiply, or divide correctly, much less do calculus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reason is that he has not gone to school to obtain a formal education.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every Lord's Day he has gone to the meeting, but at the meetings there are only some "famous" speakers preaching without any classes for learning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If at a university there were no exams, no books, and no professors but only a bunch of students listening to famous people lecturing every day, then after thirty years of listening, these students would still have not been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we must see that this has been our negligence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is our urgent, present need.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The system for our meetings needs to be changed and must be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our concepts must also be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The truths we preach may be spiritual, without any emphasis on education; however, since they are truths, there inherently is a good deal of substance that is educational in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since it is educational, there needs to be an educational system.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Availability and Spread of the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second, in recent years there has been a wonderful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Regardless of the country, the most seeking ones among the Christians have been the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a situation we did not encounter before in the past fifty years in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is easy for young people to be saved, and after being saved, they have a desire for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, the young people all have a desire for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since they have believed into the Lord Jesus, they want to know what He is all about and what the Bible teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why, according to the statistics of the Taiwan Gospel Bookroom, the best-selling books have been the books on studying the Bible, especially the life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This phenomenon is the same throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Apparently it has not been very dramatic; however, the result and effect has been deep and wide.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the past, the charismatic movement was quite prevailing in America, but now it is out-of-date.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The charismatic movement pumps air into people, but regardless of the type of air, eventually it dissipates.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even if the best tire or the best football is filled with air, after a period of time, that air will seep out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, the charismatic movement cannot meet people's needs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What people really need today is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God desires that all men would be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth 1 Tim 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was not only so during Paul's time but it is even more so today.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The entire earth needs the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Take South America for example.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All of Central and South America have opened to the truth, especially to the truth among us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even if we were to send two hundred full-time workers to Central and South America, that would not be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everywhere there is a reverberating cry for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If every one of our co-workers were able to present the truth to others, then wherever they went, they would be able to set up a stall for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps ten people would come on the first night, the next night twenty would come, and after one week perhaps two hundred would come.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They would all come to listen to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is a pity that none of us goes out to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all know that the Central and South Americas are strongly influenced by Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Catholicism does not have the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although the charismatic movement brought in some excitement for awhile, ultimately there was no truth in it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As a result, the people in Central and South America are hungry inwardly, longing for someone who can preach the truth to come to them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After this fellowship, I believe that we all will realize that the Lord's recovery has a vast field for the work today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Furthermore, because the truths in the entire New Testament have been completely released and put into print, we surely have the truths among us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should have a hope for the present generation; this refers to the young people's being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Fifty years ago when we first came out to work, we did not see a situation like the one today.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once in Taipei, after two days of meeting, Hall One alone had about one hundred fifty people baptized with the majority being young people.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today the situation in the entire Lord's recovery is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whether it is in Germany, Japan, or America, everywhere there are young people; what they seek after the most is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today as we work, we must learn the secret that although many things can excite the young people, what retains them, gives them long-lasting satisfaction, and edifies them is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, first we should change the system of our meetings by splitting them up, and second, we should pay attention to the availability and spread of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord's recovery has already been among us for sixty years, first entering into the Chinese-speaking world and then moving into the English-speaking world in the west.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Today the Lord's word is in all the major languages in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our publications are even in the Russian-speaking world; there are over ten books already translated into Russian.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This situation truly causes us to be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The speed of our translation has not been able to match the pressing need.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This shows us that the field of work there is vast.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Their desire to seek the truth is urgent.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now we need to have a clear vision so that we can measure up to the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>At the same time our goal is to present and dispense the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Not only is there an abundance of truth among us, but the spiritual truths are also rich in the following four aspects: Christ, the Spirit, life, and the Body of Christ, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Aside from us, almost no one can speak on these four great truths Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Among us, these truths are very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Today the reason we are here is because we all have been kept by the truth and have been inwardly enriched with life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Now we need to find a way to spread outwardly, allowing the Lord to truly increase.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>For our practice, in principle we have to break up the large meetings into smaller meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is not to say that there will not be the large meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Rather, on the one hand, we may have the large meetings, but on the other hand, we have to pay attention to the release and spread of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>For this reason, all of us must rise up to learn the truth.</S>
