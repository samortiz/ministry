Second Corinthians 1:21-22 says, "But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God, Who has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts." In these verses we see the Spirit as the anointing, as the seal, and as the pledge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE ANOINTING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Moving of the Spirit in Us</H2><P>First John 2:27 says, "The anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things."</P><P>[The anointing is very mysterious, but it is also real and experiential. Instead of using the noun "ointment," John uses the verbal noun "anointing." This word refers to the moving of the all-inclusive Spirit within us.] [This Spirit is the fulfillment of the type of the compound ointment revealed in Exodus 30. In this compound ointment there are a number of different elements which are the ingredients of the ointment. Just as paint may have a number of different elements, so the anointing Spirit also has different elements.] These elements include divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of Christ's death, the power of His resurrection, and the ability to bear responsibility.</P>
