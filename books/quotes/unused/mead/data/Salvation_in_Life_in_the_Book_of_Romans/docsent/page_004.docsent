   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Explaining Clearly That the Just Shall Have Life and Live by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Greek word rendered live in Romans 1:17 has a double meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It means to have life as well as to live.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This sentence originally came from Habakkuk 2:4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament it is quoted three times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, it is quoted in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then it is quoted in Galatians 3:11.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Last, it is quoted in Hebrews 10:38.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Galatians the emphasis is on having life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Hebrews the emphasis is on living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in Romans the emphasis is on both meanings: to have life and live.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You have to circle these three terms: the just, faith, life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you go back, you have to teach the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Tell them that Romans talks about the just, faith, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you only talk about the just and faith, you are only up to Romans 5:10.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After 5:10 it talks about justification unto life 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Faith gives us justification, and the result is that we enjoy the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Formerly, we were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we believed in the Lord, we were justified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, we have life and shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, after Romans 5:10, we are told how one should live after he has life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Just the One Whom God Justifies, to Whom God Has Given His Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not just; we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, God gave the Lord Jesus to us as His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The word gave means to reckon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is like the reckoning in accounting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, you may owe someone eighty billion dollars and be unable to repay him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So, God gives you eighty billion and reckons it to your account.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way, you no longer have any debt.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, you are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Out of Faith Taking Faith as the Principle</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God reckons His righteousness to man out of faith, taking faith as the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not by work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Righteousness here is God's righteousness; it comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Faith here is our faith; it is of us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Shall Have Life and Live Receiving the Eternal Life of God, and Living by This Life of God</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has a righteousness for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether we can have it depends on our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, we have to believe and receive right away, so that we can have this righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has righteousness, and we have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When these two combine, we receive God's eternal life and are able to live by this life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE DEATH OF CHRIST AND HIS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through the death of Christ, we are reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This includes redemption and justification Rom 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are saved in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the full and rich saving of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Redemption plus saving equals the gospel of God, His full and rich salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you go back to your localities, you have to teach the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You cannot do it the way I am doing it teaching three lessons in one evening.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Perhaps, you can only teach half a lesson every evening.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You should do it slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You have to believe that this will lay a foundation in them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not man's word or man's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is the holy Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When you transfuse them this way, the Word will get into them.</S>
