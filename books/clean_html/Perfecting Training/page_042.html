<h2 class="head1">BOUND TO THE LORD</h2>
<p>When I was a child we had a lot of three-legged races. Two people had two legs tied together so that they had to coordinate as one. You have to realize that today you and the Lord Jesus are bound together. You and He are racing in a three-legged race. Don&rsquo;t run just by yourself. If you do you will fall. Don&rsquo;t forget that you are one with Him, and you are living with Him. Not many can run a three-legged race. You wouldn&rsquo;t care for the other party. You would cut off the binding. You would free yourself. We all have done this concerning the Lord Jesus. In a sense we all have told the Lord: &ldquo;Lord, You stay here. Let me go ahead. Don&rsquo;t come along with me. If You come I can&rsquo;t get my thing done. Lord, give me a little freedom for just half a day. Just for Saturday afternoon I&rsquo;m on vacation.&rdquo; But we all have learned regardless of how much we would ask the Lord leave, He would never give it to us. You may cut the binding, but He would bind it again. Whenever we would try to take a vacation, we simply get in trouble. The point is this: God&rsquo;s economy is just to put Christ together with us. We have no choice. This is our destiny whether this seems poor or whether this seems very much blessed. It depends upon your realization. This is your destiny.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MARRIED TO THE LORD</h2>
<p>For example, the marriage life should be a life always with two together. Although we love the marriage life, sometimes we realize it is a binding and bothering life. If you open the window, your husband may complain. If you put some water on the plant, he says you put too much. Also, whatever you do, she would say something. In the marriage life we all are good complainers. What shall we do? The disciples told the Lord Jesus it is better not to get married (Matt. 19:10-12). But the Lord said that it was not up to them. You must have the gift. You need a gift not to have a wife. But most of us didn&rsquo;t receive such a gift. This is our destiny.</p>
<p>In like manner God has ordained that we must have a husband. That is Christ. God doesn&rsquo;t want us to live single or as a widow. We must have a husband, Christ. This is God&rsquo;s ordination, and this is our destiny. We must live a life of two together. God had no intention for you to live a life just by yourself. If you try to live in that way you will get into trouble. That is against God&rsquo;s divine principle, and that is kicking against God&rsquo;s ordination. You can never get through. So we have to take Christ as our life and live with Him like two persons who are living one life together. We have to live such a life, and to live such a life is to always call on Him. In other words, using our daily expression, we just talk to Him. Don&rsquo;t stop talking with Him. Talk to Him all the time. While you are talking to your wife, talk to Christ. While you are talking to your boss or employee, talk to Christ. Don&rsquo;t do any talking just by yourself. Don&rsquo;t forget that you should never be single. You&rsquo;re not destined to a single life. You are now living a marriage life, and your husband is Christ. We all have Him as our husband. We must live with our husband. Don&rsquo;t go anywhere without Him. Don&rsquo;t do anything without Him, and don&rsquo;t say anything without Him. All the time you have to do things with Him. This is to pray unceasingly. Now I have the assurance that I know what it means to pray unceasingly and how we can pray unceasingly. It is this: all the day long you should call on Him; you should talk to Him. By this you are breathing. This is to live spiritually, and to live spiritually is just to live Christ. I do believe this kind of fellowship hits the mark. You have to come back to this point: you must do all things by talking to the Lord, by praying to Him, by calling on Him. This is to breathe that you may live Him.</p>
