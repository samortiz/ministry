<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF A RIGHT SPIRIT TO SERVE THE LORD</h2><p>Here we face a problem: What kind of spirit is a right spirit? What kind of spirit is a wrong spirit? The above passage tells us that it is not enough to serve the Lord, love Him, and be zealous for Him. We have to know how our spirit is. We have to realize that a man is disapproved not because his conduct is wrong but because his spirit is wrong. The disciples were right in their zeal and love for the Lord; they were very scriptural, but because their spirit was wrong, everything was wrong. Man approves others based on conduct. But if a Christian approves others based on conduct, he has lowered the standard of spiritual things to its very lowest point. With many people the controversy is conduct, but the Lord looks at a man's spirit. The disciples might have been zealous for the Lord, but they were rebuked because their spirit was wrong. The Lord pays attention to our spirit. Man pays attention to conduct, Bible knowledge, zeal, and love, but the standard of the Christian life is based on the spirit, not on these things. The issue is the spirit, not events and work. Many young people argue about events and work. But the Lord's eyes are not on these things.</p><h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO THE RIGHTNESS OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>The Lord Jesus told the disciples that they did not know their spirit. Here we see a strange thing. James and John were speaking. They were asking on behalf of the Lord for God to send fire from heaven. The Lord did not rebuke them for saying the wrong words. He only rebuked them for having a wrong spirit. Among the saints, the most frequent controversy we hear is whose words are right and whose words are wrong. But I never argue about these things. Many times the brothers and sisters hear me say, "Your words are right, but your spirit is wrong." The Lord was not concerned about the rightness of the disciples' words. Behind the words, however, was the expression of the spirit. Was the spirit right? Whether or not our words are right is a separate issue. Our spirit comes out as soon as we open our mouth. The spirit that comes out of us may be a right spirit or it may be a wrong spirit. We should not emphasize merely the rightness of our words, but should consider the spirit as well.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>The Lord's words show us that a man can have a wrong spirit yet be completely ignorant of it. A man may be completely ignorant of himself. James and John trusted in themselves too much. They wanted to repeat what Elijah had done. They did not realize that their spirit was wrong. It is not surprising for a person to have a wrong spirit, but it is a strange thing for a man to have a wrong spirit yet not know about it. It is easy to recover a person who has erred in his spirit, but it is hard to recover one who does not know that he has erred in his spirit. The most horrible thing is not to sin but to sin and be ignorant of it, thinking all the while that you are doing good. It is hard to awaken those who are in darkness. A child may have a black face without knowing anything about it. When he comes into a room and others laugh at him, he may think that others like him. I tremble for those who have a wrong spirit but do not know about it. The trouble is not the mistake itself, but the absence of revelation and light. The words a man speaks tell us the kind of spirit he has. But often a man does not know what kind of spirit he has. Solomon said no one knows his own heart. Only foolish ones say that they know their own heart (Prov. 28:26).</p><p>A man cannot say that he does not have a spirit just because he does not know that he has a spirit. In the same way, a man cannot say that there is nothing wrong with his spirit just because he does not know that his spirit is wrong. If a man's spirit is wrong, it is wrong. When he speaks, his spirit is exposed. The disciples volunteered to vindicate the Lord. But the Lord's word shows us that they did not know their spirit, they did not know themselves, and they did not know that their spirit was in their speaking. When we speak, we may not know our spirit, and we may not know that our spirit is wrong. But those who listen know immediately that our spirit is wrong. The experienced ones who stand next to us know immediately. A man's word can be very scriptural. He can be zealous for the Lord, but if he does not have a right spirit, those who are in fellowship with the Lord will know immediately. I hope our brothers and sisters will learn before the Lord that God's standard for the Christian life is not just something scriptural, moral, and upright. Our walk should issue from a right spirit.</p>
