   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God s Economy, Arrangement, Administration, Dispensation, and Stewardship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 1:8-11 says, Which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him; in whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this passage we can see God s eternal purpose concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is something of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word economy means an arrangement, an administration, a dispensation, a stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we put all these words together stewardship, dispensation, arrangement, administration we have an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word economy means very much.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It means that God made an arrangement and an administration to do something, which is to dispense Himself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is the central matter in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To use our human words, the church is God s business.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Business is the central matter in an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A big corporation has an economy to do a certain business.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God also has an economy, and in this economy God s divine business is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s economy is to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the church is not a small item.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians do not realize the church to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may have the thought that the church is merely a gathering of people who were fallen and now are saved and come together to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, this is too low a thought.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we think this, we have never looked from the heavens, and we have never looked from eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we would look from the heavens and into eternity, we will see that the church is higher than the traditional Christian thought about it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the central item of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s dispensation, administration, arrangement, and governmental stewardship are for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to realize the church to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the church is the central item in God s economy, it was planned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church did not come about by accident or all of a sudden.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was planned by God in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is why Ephesians 1:10 mentions God s economy concerning the church, and 3:11 speaks of the eternal purpose which God made.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God purposed and planned to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Church Being Eternal in Nature</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is something eternal because it is something of the eternal plan of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eternal is a matter not only of time but also of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eternal means unlimited in time, but it also refers to the uncreated nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Anything that is created is not eternal; anything uncreated is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only God is uncreated, so only God is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the church were not mingled with God, the church could not be eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All created things are merely in time, not in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only when God Himself mingles with us do we have eternity, the eternal nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Church Being in God Himself</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is according to the economy of God, it is the purpose or plan of God, and it is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is also in God Himself 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 5 says, Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Several times the writer of Ephesians uses the word Himself with emphasis, instead of simply Him v. 9; 2:15; 4:11; 5:2, 27 . The church must be something of God and in God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To be in God Himself is the real meaning of the word holy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The wooden boards of the tabernacle became golden by being in the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the same way, to be holy means to be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Church Being in Christ and for Christ</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is also something in Christ and for Christ Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 1:30; Gal 1:22; Eph 2:6, 10; 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope that you would remember well these five points: the church is God s purpose, it is God s economy, it is eternal, it is in God Himself, and it is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>GOD S INTENTION CONCERNING THE CHURCH To Have Many Sons as His Multiplication</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s intention concerning the church is first to produce many sons with His life 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All these sons have the life of God and inherit all that He is, all that He has, all that He planned, and all that He accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every member of the church is a son of God and also will eventually be an heir of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this sense, God s intention for the church is to multiply and reproduce Himself, to have a mass reproduction of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a man has many sons, all these sons are his multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A few years ago, there was only the one man by himself, but today there are many of him he is the original, and his sons are his duplication and multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The multiplication of God is His family, and His family is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ephesians 1:5 speaks of the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The real meaning of sonship is the multiplication of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God is unlimited, but God still needs a great multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After God created Adam, He told him to multiply and replenish the earth, that is, to fill up the earth Gen 1:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God s intention for the church is to produce many sons, to multiply Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>John 12:24 tells us that the one grain would become many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The many grains are the multiplication, duplication, and reproduction of the one grain.</S>
