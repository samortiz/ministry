   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ as the firstborn Son of God was the first item germinated in the one resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In His incarnation Christ put humanity upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This humanity was not divine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 8:3 indicates that when Christ came in incarnation, He came "in the likeness of the flesh of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time of His crucifixion He brought His human part, which was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, to the cross and terminated it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But that was not all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In resurrection He germinated His humanity, making His humanity divine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way He was born as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ Himself as the firstborn Son of God was the first item that needed to be germinated in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. Making Christ the Last Adam</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>the Life-giving Spirit</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then He went to the cross and died there for the accomplishment of God's eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After a three day burial He rose up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In His one resurrection as the last Adam, a man in the flesh, He became the life-giving Spirit for the imparting of His divine life into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is marvelous and unique in the universe and in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>D. Regenerating All the Believers in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>to Be the Many Sons of God</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before His resurrection Christ was the only begotten Son of God John 3:16 , but in resurrection He was born the firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is something new.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word firstborn indicates that many sons will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The many sons were the second item Christ germinated in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through Christ's one resurrection all God's chosen people were regenerated to be the many sons of God 1 Pet 1:3; Heb 2:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The one resurrection first germinated Jesus, who was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, to be born of God as the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This one resurrection also made Christ the last Adam the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Accompanying the previous two things, millions of God's chosen people were regenerated to be the many sons of God in the one resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the last Adam, Jesus was still in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the blood and flesh that Jesus put on in His incarnation were of the old creation, He put them on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit and the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the same time we as God's chosen people were regenerated to be the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now the firstborn Son of God, the life-giving Spirit, and the many sons of God are all in the new creation through the one resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the real base of the one Body, because these regenerated sons of God are the members who compose the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In His incarnation Christ became the first grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then through His death and resurrection He produced us as the many grains John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These many grains in His one resurrection have become the members of His one Body.</S>
