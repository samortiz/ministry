   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A STRONG WILL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man's will needs to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The emotion should be soft, but the will should not.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To have a soft will is equivalent to having no will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please consider: if the brake is soft, how can you stop the car?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the rudder of a ship is made of paper, it cannot function as a rudder.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is imperative that the rudder be hard and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, one's will cannot effectively function as a will unless it is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Anyone who follows the Lord faithfully and maintains his standing unchanged till death is a person with a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every martyr is a man with a firm, strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Consider Martin Luther or John Wycliffe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They were people with a strong, resolute will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Again, look at the three friends of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The trial of the fiery furnace showed that they truly had strong, firm wills.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Similarly, our prayer cannot last long unless we have a strong, firm will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus said, "Watch and pray; pray always."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need a strong, firm will in order to be able to watch and be constant in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One who is a jellyfish can never be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He can only pray sometimes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He cannot endure in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although prayer is a refined matter, it requires a resolute will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From the first day that Daniel prayed for his people, his words were heard by God, and God sent an angel to answer his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the angel met the resistance of an evil prince in the air and fought for three weeks before he could get to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During that time, Daniel, who was on earth, needed a resolute will to persist in prayer for the three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>None of those who know how to pray properly and constantly have a weak will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, each one has a will that is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Fallen people have many abnormal conditions such as: the will needs to be strong, yet it is not; the mind needs to be sober, yet it is not; and the emotion needs to be in abundance, yet it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But with a spiritual man, his mind is sober and rich; his emotion is certainly abundant and moderate, and his will is definitely strong and firm.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We often say that one needs to be bold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But one who has a weak will can never be bold.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the bold ones are men who have a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The three friends of Daniel were really bold when they were there by the furnace, because their wills were really strong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That boldness came from the strength of their will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some are very weak and can be easily frightened by one little threatening word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because their will is not resolute, they become afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a man cannot pray.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan will use all kinds of methods to torture, destroy, and obliterate the life of prayer that is in man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, unless man has a strong will, his prayer life will be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, it is necessary to have a strong will in order to maintain the prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A PLIABLE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To be strong is one thing, but to be pliable is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be strong yet not pliable is to be stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be strong is proper, but to be stubborn is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everyone who learns how to pray should have a will that is strong but not stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The will should be pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This pliability can be illustrated by the spring in a watch.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may say that the spring is hard, but you may also say that it is pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the spring is strong yet pliable, it can serve as a motivating power.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be strong means that I reject everything that is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be pliable means that I receive and yield myself to everything that is positive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I exercise a strong will to deal with everything that is from Satan, but I exercise a pliable will to receive everything that is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In our prayers, many times when we have barely touched the presence of God we soon lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The main reason is that we are not pliable enough.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In our prayer, God's feeling has taken a turn, yet we do not turn.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We insist on praying as before.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To have such an insistence is not to be properly strong, but to be headstrong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The day that Peter went up on the housetop to pray and saw the vision of the great sheet, his will was firm but not stubborn it was pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The record in Acts 10 says that when he was praying, he became hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then he saw a certain vessel descending, as it were, a great sheet, wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts, creeping things of the earth, and birds of the heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And there came a voice to him, saying, "Rise, Peter; kill, and eat" v. 13 . But Peter said, "Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean" v. 14 . This shows his resoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But God spoke to him three times, and, during the last time, some men were calling for him at the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Spirit told him to go down to meet them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once he went down, his attitude was changed and he immediately agreed to go with those Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Here you can see that Peter's will was very pliable and not stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be stubborn means to be hard.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If he had insisted that regardless of anything he would not communicate with the Gentiles or touch anything that is common and unclean, he would have been a stubborn, hard person.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many times we are unable to follow the move of the Spirit in our prayers, for we are strong to the extent that we become hard.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a very great problem of ours.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The problem arises, not only with regard to prayer, but in many other matters, also.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Sometimes when we need to be strong, we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At other times, in being strong, we go too far and become hard.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, we cannot see the light, touch the presence of God, or have spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At the same time, we are not able to endure in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The firmness of our will needs the corresponding pliability.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The pliability must balance the firmness if the will is suitable for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Satan always utilizes men, things, and outside activities to consume, extinguish, and obliterate our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, we need to exercise our will in order to stand fast.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At the same time, in our prayers, our will should at all times be able to submit and turn according to the consciousness in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Consider how soft the spring in a clock or watch is.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Yet once it has been wound and starts to move the hands of the clock, it will not yield or be subdued that is its firmness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Once they have been disturbed by some trivial matter, some are not able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This shows that their will is not firm enough.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>On the other hand, there are some who are very strong, and who insist on praying for a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They do not know how to turn and follow the move of the Spirit in them.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This shows that they are not pliable enough.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Many have a will that is either too soft or too hard.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But neither softness nor hardness is desirable.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The kind of will we need is one that is strong yet not hard, and pliable yet not soft.</S>
