<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE HISTORY CONCERNING SAMUEL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HIS ORIGIN, BIRTH, AND YOUTH</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Sam. 1:1&#151;2:11, 18-21, 26</H1><P>In this message we will begin to consider the history concerning Samuel, beginning with his origin, birth, and youth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. HIS ORIGIN</H2><P>In 1:1-20 we have a word regarding Samuel's origin. We should not consider that Samuel came out simply from his father, Elkanah. Actually, Samuel came out of God's economy. God had His eternal economy, but the carrying out of God's economy had come into question. God had ordained that Aaron's descendants would be the priests for the carrying out of His economy, but that priesthood became stale and waning. God's heart's desire was to gain someone to replace that priesthood.</P><P>In order to gain such a person, God brought together in marriage Elkanah and Hannah. Elkanah had two wives. According to God's sovereign arrangement, the second wife, Peninnah, had children, but Hannah had no children. Furthermore, "her rival provoked her bitterly to irritate her, because Jehovah had shut up her womb" (v. 6). This forced Hannah to pray desperately not mainly for herself but for God. She promised God that if He gave her a male child, she would return the child to Him by the vow of a Nazarite. God was pleased with Hannah's prayer and her promise and He opened her womb. Hannah conceived, bore a child, and named him Samuel. From this we see that actually no human being was the origin of Samuel. God was the real origin, who motivated His people sovereignly and secretly.</P>
