   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Thrown into the Lake of Fire</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Second Death</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fourth aspect related to the suffering of death is that of the entire person spirit and soul and body being thrown into the lake of fire to suffer for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is what the Bible refers to as the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man s spirit is dead, then his body dies, and his soul suffers in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These three aspects together comprise the first death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This first death is progressive, starting with death in the spirit, proceeding to death in the body, and culminating with the suffering of death in the soul and spirit in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the soul and spirit suffer in Hades, the process involving the first death is completed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Strictly speaking, after a person is born, he is not living every day but dying every day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, his body dies, and his soul suffers in Hades, completing the first death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the future the spirit and soul will come forth out of Hades, and his body will come out from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The entire person of those who are not saved will be resurrected, pass through God s judgment, and then be thrown into the lake of fire to suffer the second death, which is to suffer in the lake of fire eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The suffering of this death is the ultimate suffering of death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first death is a step-by-step process, but the second death, the death of the entire unsaved person, occurs and consummates at the time of judgment at the great white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire Rev 20:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the future all those who are not saved and whose names are not written in the book of life will be thrown into the lake of fire to perish for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the false, their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death Rev 21:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All unforgiven sinners, no matter what their sin, will be thrown into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the portion that sinners will receive for sinning, and this is the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Cast into the lake of fire and brimstone...and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever ; He shall be tormented in fire and brimstone...forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night Rev 20:10; 14:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The unforgiven sinners who perish in the lake of fire will suffer day and night without rest forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The result of the first death, going to Hades, is temporary and the suffering of its flames less severe than that of the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The result of the second death, being cast into the lake of fire, is eternal, and its eternal sufferings are indescribably severe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people say that a person no longer exists and no longer has any feelings when he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But this is not the revelation of the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible shows that the soul and spirit of a dead unbeliever is full of a sense of suffering in the flames of Hades Luke 16:23-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, when his entire person spirit and soul and body is cast into the lake of fire, he will be tormented in fire and brimstone and have no rest day and night forever and ever Rev 14:10-11; 20:10, 15; 19:20; 21:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Bible speaks of perishing John 3:16 , it does not mean the end of existence, because this same word is translated ruined in Matthew 9:17 and Mark 2:22, where the wineskins are ruined and lose their original usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew 10:6 and 15:24 and in Luke 15:4, 32, and 19:10 this same word is also translated as lost, referring to the house of Israel, sheep, the prodigal son, and sinners.</S>

   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>People fear death, and because they fear death, they are slaves to death and under its control.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the result of the devil s exercising the might of death upon people.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, He resurrected, bringing life and incorruption to light.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we not only leave death behind through His death-destroying death but also overcome death by His incorruptible life.</S>
