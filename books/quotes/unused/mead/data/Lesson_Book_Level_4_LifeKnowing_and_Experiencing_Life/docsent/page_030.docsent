   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. PRESERVING OUR SPIRIT FOR LIFE A. Exercising Our Spirit to Contact God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our spirit is composed of three parts: the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our spirit is mainly for us to fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we have fellowship with God, we contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This contact with God spontaneously gives us a sense of God, a consciousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Intuition denotes the direct sense and consciousness that came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through this intuition we can know whether we are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are wrong, we shall be condemned by our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if we are right, we shall be justified by our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our conscience, therefore, either accuses and condemns or excuses and justifies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way to preserve our spirit is first to exercise it to have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we fail to exercise our spirit in this way, we shall leave it in a deadened situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we Christians come together in a church meeting, we need to function.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to pray, praise, or give a word of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to exercise our spirit and not allow it to remain dormant or in a deadened condition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But sorry to say, many saints do not preserve their spirit by exercising it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, they allow their spirit to remain dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seems that they leave their spirit in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is your spirit in a tomb right now?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Corinthians 12:3 says, "No one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Call on the Lord to exercise your spirit to come alive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. Keeping Our Spirit Living</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The apostle Paul said, "Always rejoice; unceasingly pray; in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not quench the Spirit'' 1 Thes 5:16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To rejoice, to pray, and to give thanks is to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we exercise our spirit in this way, we cause it to be living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Exercising the spirit to keep it living is the first way to preserve it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of the fall, our spirit has been deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our spirit, therefore, must overcome the problem of deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spirit of an unbeliever is absolutely dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Most of those around you at school, at work, or in your neighborhood are utterly dead in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Have you been sanctified, separated, from a spirit-deadening situation?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should struggle to save ourselves from that kind of situation by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Praise the Lord, call upon His name, declare His doings among the people, make mention that His name is exalted'' Isa 12:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By doing that, we pull our spirit out of death and cooperate with the operation of the Triune God in sanctifying us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He wants to separate all of us from those whose spirits are deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we have been regenerated, we need to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to show that our spirit is living, that it is not deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, our spirit should rejoice, pray, and give thanks to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>C. Keeping Our Spirit from Defilement</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another way to preserve our spirit is found in 2 Corinthians 7:1.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this verse Paul says, "Having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This verse indicates that we should abstain from all defilement of both flesh and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to stay away from anything that contaminates our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the reason we should keep our eyes from looking at evil things, such as defiling pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such pictures defile not only our eyes; they also defile our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a result, you will not be able to pray unless you first ask the Lord to cleanse you from all defilement.</S>
