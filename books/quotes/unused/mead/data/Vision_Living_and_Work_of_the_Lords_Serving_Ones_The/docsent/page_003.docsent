   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fellowshipping with the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Enlightened, and Confessing Our Sins</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In leading the new believers we must first help them to pray, read the Bible, meet with the saints, and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should spend more time in preaching the gospel, helping them to be active in approaching non-believers and speaking the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, these four matters are outward; they are related to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We still need to help the new believers to enter into their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to our experience, in addition to helping them to pray, read the Bible, meet with the saints, and preach the gospel, we also need to help them learn to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fellowshipping with the Lord is a general subject, but it involves many items.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To fellowship with the Lord is to contact the Lord, and such contact with the Lord takes place mainly during our prayer or reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While praying and reading the Word, we contact the Lord and fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This brings in His shining, and thus we are enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, the Lord uses His Word, the Bible, to shine on us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, the Spirit of the Lord within us gives us a spiritual sense and speaks to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This sense and the Spirit s speaking also enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should help new believers according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may point out to them that when we are newly saved, the Lord speaks to us mainly through His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord may show us that we are wrong in the way that we treat our parents, our children, our spouse, our neighbors, or our colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we should confess these sins to the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever sins we sense within, we should confess one by one to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is how to confess our sins; it is also how to deal with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After helping them learn to confess their sins, we need to speak to new believers concerning being cleansed by the Lord s precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can read 1 John 1:9 and the second part of verse 7 with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 9 says, If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 7 says, The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a believer understands these two verses, he will realize his need to confess his sins and allow God to forgive and cleanse him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a cleansing is through the precious blood of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consecration</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These examples are for our training.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first step in our work is to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we should lead the saved ones to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We first lead them to pray, read the Bible, meet with the saints, and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we lead them to fellowship with the Lord and to receive His shining through prayer and reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, we should lead them to confess and deal with their sins and to experience the cleansing of the Lord s precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At this point, some of the new believers may be touched by the Lord s Spirit to present themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some may offer themselves in this way, not as a result of the Spirit s leading in life but as the issue of our teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot say that this is wrong; nevertheless, it is better if a new believer, after having dealt with his sins, would have a spontaneous desire within his spirit to consecrate himself to the Lord and thus pray, Lord, I truly love You, and I desire to give myself and my whole life to You.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Walking according to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After a believer consecrates himself, we should lead him to take another step forward.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the life of a normal Christian, after consecration he should learn to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we need to help him by explaining that he is one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that the Lord who is in him can lead him, and that his living and conduct, his intentions, thoughts, speech, and attitude should follow the inner feeling that the Spirit gives him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Knowing the Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After new ones learn to walk according to the spirit, we need to bring them into the anointing, or we may say the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is an important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After helping new ones to fellowship with the Lord, to be enlightened, to confess their sins, and to consecrate themselves, we should help them to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we should point out that they have the anointing within them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should tell them that the Lord is the Spirit, and the Lord s Spirit is the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All His actions within us are the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This anointing within us is teaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should help them as much as we can.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more help we render, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must let them know that by the anointing the Lord gives us a feeling, and we should walk according to this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we can give them an illustration: When we apply ointment to our skin, we have a sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Similarly, when the Spirit as the ointment anoints us within, we have a sensation, and we should walk according to the anointing, that is, according to the sensation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a believer can live and move according to the anointing, he will advance in his spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to learn many lessons because our ability to render help to others depends on how much we have experienced the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not have adequate knowledge of the anointing or the teaching of the anointing, we should get help from our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should find the relevant books and study them and practice what we learn from the books.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is only when we know and experience the anointing that we can render help to others.</S>
