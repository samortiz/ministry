   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE CRUCIAL POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR OUR SERVICE TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult for a capable person to rely on God and receive leading.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nine out of ten who rise up for the Lord are bold and strong in their will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the service of the Lord, such people need to be softened within once they rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One who is weak is useless, but one who is too strong is also useless.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One who is weak cannot rise up, but one who is too strong does not trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must always remember that serving the Lord is a matter of the Lord s work and of meeting His need in coordination with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most people are weak when they should be strong and strong when they should be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, among so many people, it is difficult for the Lord to find some who are truly useful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people, no matter how many times the Lord calls, cannot rise up; they are either concerned for their wives or concerned for their children.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Others who rise up, however, cannot be softened inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are like a wild donkey, acting apart from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the matter of serving the Lord, we must be clear concerning three points, or we will be altogether useless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, we must see that the Lord s work is carried out by His mingling with man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord does not work alone, and neither can man work by himself; rather, the Lord works in union with man, and man needs to let the Lord work because He is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, we must see that we need to rise up strongly to cooperate with Him to meet His need.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Third, we need to see that once we rise up, we must immediately prostrate ourselves before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, our zeal, our pursuit, and our desire will not match the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord often wants us to stop, but we cannot stop.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, when we rise up in response to the Lord, He will say, You should fall down in Me. Many of us cannot do this without tricks and methods.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In my service with the brothers from 1946 until now, I have learned to not use tricks or human methods when we encounter problems.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I fear tricks more than sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This does not mean that we should be foolish or even that we are not tricky but that the One whom we serve does not need our tricks.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone who serves the Lord must learn these three crucial lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is difficult for those who cannot rise up to rise up, but it is also difficult for those who have risen up to fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only those who have risen up and then fall down are useful before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only those who can stop in God s work, rise up in His call, and fall down in His service can serve God and administrate the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we sense that the Lord is not in a certain work, we should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even if it will have a great impact, we should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we may receive people s praise, we should not do anything that the Lord is not in. Without fellowshipping with the Lord and without His presence, we should not go on by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moses leading of the children of Israel depended upon the Lord s presence Exo 33:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we serve the Lord, we also need the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These three points stopping in God s work, rising up in His call, and falling down in His service seem to be contradictory, and some people cannot tolerate the changes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we want them to stop, they cannot stop, but once they stop, they go to an extreme and even stop meditating and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Stopping when the Lord wants us to stop is not an easy lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A brother who had great enthusiasm was unable to stop no matter how much we implored him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When he finally stopped, he stopped to the point of not even acknowledging that he was a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we wanted him to stop, he could not stop, but when he stopped, he stopped in an extreme way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a consequence, he lost his usefulness to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, we must learn to stop ourselves in the Lord s work, to rise up in the Lord s command, and to continually fall down in His service.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No matter how much the children of Israel tormented Moses, he was willing to rise up, but he also always fell down before God and let Him work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Question: Although we should not play tricks when we serve the Lord, we also need to be prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is the difference between playing tricks and being prudent?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Answer: Matthew 10:16 says, Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Be therefore prudent as serpents and guileless as doves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be prudent is to escape the difficulty and harm that come from others; to be guileless is not to hurt others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Prudence is related to avoiding being hurt by others; hence, it is not applicable among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Being prudent is different from employing tricks.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Tricks are used to reach one s goals, and prudence is necessary to avoid being hurt by others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Question: Peter followed the Lord unconditionally because he met the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, we have not met the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Answer: If a person wants to answer the Lord s call, he first must experience the Lord s call.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have experienced the Lord s call, we have met the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Peter answered the Lord s call so quickly because he met the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we have not met the Lord, we do not need to answer the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, I do not think that there is anyone among us who can truly say that he has never met the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If a brother says that he has never met the Lord, he must not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every saved one has met the Lord in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What does it mean to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A brother once said that the strictness of our interview with people before their baptism should be re-examined.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, the strictness of the interview is not the point; rather, we must be able to sense that a person has met the Lord when we interview him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If he has met the Lord once, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, if he has merely heard, believed, and received a doctrine, he is a pious person at the most.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If someone has met the Lord, he may outwardly say that he does not believe, but he cannot help but believe inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Every saved one has met the Lord, but the difference is that some have met the Lord in a strong way, and others in only a more moderate way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Likewise, whenever a person meets the Lord, there is some demand within him; this demand is the Lord s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our concern is not whether someone has met the Lord, but whether, after meeting the Lord, he is serious, quick to respond, and absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Before he meets the Lord, he does not need to answer the Lord s call, but after he is saved and has met the Lord, he should immediately answer the Lord s call.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It also is unlikely that we have not met the Lord after being saved because the Lord comes to us repeatedly, even as we are walking on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Sometimes when we are in the car, He comes to us; sometimes when we are shopping, He comes to meet us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He comes to meet us at different times.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The real question is how we respond when He comes to meet us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our problem is not related to being unable to touch and meet Him but in being too slow and dull in answering His call.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Question: Was Moses called after he turned eighty?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Answer: A person s calling has a beginning, course, and completion.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we investigate the time when Moses was called, it was before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The calling of Moses was not an accidental act or idle whim of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The name Moses means drawn out.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Long before the foundation of the world, he was drawn out.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God also set apart Paul in his mother s womb Gal 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Not only did the matter of our calling take place before the foundation of the world; even our salvation occurred before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This shows that God took several steps in the preparation of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>First, God prepared godly parents who infused him with godly thoughts after his birth Exo 2:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Second, God prepared the environment of the palace in Egypt for him so that he could receive the best education of his time to lead the children of Israel 3:10; Acts 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Moses commission could not have been undertaken by someone who did not have any training.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hence, God allowed him to enter into the palace to be properly regulated and cultivated.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Third, through the infusing of his parents, Moses had the godly thought and concept that he needed to rescue the children of Israel Heb 11:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>To him, this was the beginning of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Fourth, God prepared the wilderness for him in order to train his character.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Although he had godly thoughts and had received a high education, his character was not fully trained, nor had he gone through any human sufferings Acts 7:23-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He was very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He had no children or any special environment, so God caused him to shepherd a flock in the wilderness for forty years so that he could be refined in a furnace like hard steel v. 29 . When all these environments had been arranged successfully, God came in and called him in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>At this time, God s calling was complete v. 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Hence, it is difficult to determine when God called Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we consider the source, we must say that it was before the foundation of the world, but also it was in the palace, the wilderness, and the training process.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Then God came in. The principle is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we look back, we can testify that our calling was predestinated by God in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Then at a certain time, He arranged for us to be in the proper environment and did not let us go; it was at that time that we answered His call.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Question: Does the so-called boundary of work apply only to the workers?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Answer: In the Bible, the noun work has a broad and a narrow sense.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In a broad sense, whatever God does in this age through the church, the saints, and the workers through their service to Him is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In a narrow sense, there are a few, such as Paul, who are chosen and called by God and commissioned by the Lord to do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Hence, the meaning of the word worker also has two meanings, one broad and one narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In a broad sense, all the saints who preach the gospel for God are God s workers.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In a narrow sense, only those, like the apostles, who are sent by God to preach the gospel and establish churches in every place are workers of God.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>For example, in the broad sense we may tell the saints that everyone needs to do God s work, meaning that all the brothers and sisters have a part in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In principle, the narrow sense is included in the broad sense.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>For example, some answer God s call particularly and serve God in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Question: After hearing this kind of message, we are afraid to move in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>For instance, if we think that God has not moved, we do not want to move; consequently, no one even dares to open his mouth to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Answer: This shows that you have not touched the main point of the message but instead the trivial points.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It is not right if you do not move and do not pray because God has not moved during the time of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If we need to wait until God moves in order to breathe and eat, could we survive?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Without God moving, man should not move.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This is the right principle, but you have applied it in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Not moving without God means that our service before Him must be initiated by Him, not by us.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This is a great principle.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Of course, this great principle can be applied in small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>For example, in a prayer meeting, if God does not move, we should not move.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>In terms of the responsibility of the meeting, this is the right principle.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>However, we need to see that the responsibility for coming to the meeting is related to the burden we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Hence, when we come to a meeting, we should bear the burden to pray, sing, or share.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>This is not a matter of coming to the meeting and asking whether God is moving or whether God wants us to bear the responsibility of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Before bearing responsibility, we should first ask whether God has moved and entrusted this responsibility to us.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>If God is moving in us, guiding us, leading us, and wanting us to bear some responsibility, we will know what is from God as soon as we receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>After receiving a responsibility, we do not need to wait any longer and continue to seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If someone entrusts a child to our care, and we are clear that this is of the Lord, we must care for him by cooking for him and giving him a bath; there is no need to wait for the Lord to move further.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>In our service we often have the right principle but the wrong application.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>In the meeting a brother may say in a very spiritual way, If God does not move, I will not move; if I move first, it would be only a religious activity.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>A brother who says this, sooner or later, will become passive.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We do not come to a prayer meeting simply to attend but to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>We can first ask the Lord inwardly, Should I go to the prayer meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>This can be compared to someone inviting us to eat a meal at his house.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Before going, we should consider whether or not to go.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>But after deciding to go, we should freely eat and drink when we are at his house.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>If we do not eat or drink anything, people will ask us why.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>It would be improper for us to say that we need to consider it, because the time for consideration has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Therefore, in a meeting, we should actively use our spirit to fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>In this fellowship we will touch God s feeling, and we will know whether or not we should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We should not be passive in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>A genuinely spiritual person usually has much to minister in the meetings because he is joined to the Lord in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>In a fellowship meeting, if everyone is waiting and no one opens his mouth, at a certain point someone will give a strange testimony, and then someone else will also give a strange testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>This will damage the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Everyone wants to be spiritual and wait for the moving of the Holy Spirit, but this will cause the entire meeting to fall into a kind of passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>If we all actively exercise our spirit to fellowship with the Lord in spirit, we will have something to say, and the meeting will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Therefore, we should actively fellowship with the Lord in spirit in every meeting and not passively wait for Him to move our deadened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>We must all learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>What does it mean to be active in spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>What does it mean to be passive in spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>What does it mean to act in fellowship?</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>And what does it mean to act independently?</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>We must learn these lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Acting independently is religion; acting in union with the Lord is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>We must exercise our spirit so that our spirit will be strong to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>We should not give our opinions, but we can ask God to give us His commands.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>We must be so strong that we can ask God, force God, and urge God to issue commands.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>This is to exercise our spirit and to be active in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>This means that we must exercise our spirit to touch the Spirit of God and allow the Spirit of God to push our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>In this way, when we contact God, we will be able to touch God s will immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>If our spirit is living, we will cause the entire meeting to touch the Spirit whether we are praying or reading the Bible.</S>
