   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I met a certain believer once on a train who asked me what kind of Christian I was.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I replied that I was just a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He said, "There is no such Christian in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Saying that you are a Christian means nothing; you have to say what kind of Christian you are in order for it to be meaningful.''</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I replied, "I am simply a man who is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you say that for a man to be a Christian means nothing?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What kind of Christian would you say is meaningful?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As for me, I can only be a Christian nothing more.''</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That day we had a very good talk together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I would like you to see one thing: The basic thought of many people is that the name of the Lord is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many think they need the name of a denomination; they think they must have another name in addition to the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brothers, do not think that our attitude is too determined.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord said, "You...have not denied My name.''</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If my feeling is right, all other names are a shame to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This word "denied'' is the same word used to describe Peter's denial of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What kind of a Christian am I?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not want to be called by another name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many do not want to honor the name of Christ and are not willing just to be called a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But thank God, the prophecy of Philadelphia was fulfilled in the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They no longer have any other distinguishing name.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are brothers; they are not "The Brethren Church.''</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut'' Rev 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord speaks to the church in Philadelphia about the open door.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Men often say that if you walk according to the Scriptures, the door will soon be shut; the most difficult hurdle to pass in submitting to the Lord is the shutting of the door.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But here is indeed a promise: "Behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut.''</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As far as the brothers are concerned, this is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the whole world, whether in Bible exposition or gospel preaching, no group of people has had the opportunities they have had.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether in Europe, America, or Africa, it has all been like this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no need of men's support, advertisement, propaganda, or contributions; they still have many opportunities to work, and the door for work is still open.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, those who call themselves Jews and are not, but lie behold, I will cause them to come and fall prostrate before your feet and to know that I have loved you'' v. 9 . We have already seen at least four things which have caused Christianity to become Judaism: the mediatorial priests, the laws of letters, the material temple, and the earthly promises.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What does the Lord say?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"I will cause them to come and fall prostrate before your feet.''</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Judaism is destroyed in the hands of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everywhere in the whole world there is such a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wherever they are, Judaism is defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Among those who really know God today, the principal strength of Judaism has become something of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"Because you have kept the word of My endurance'' v. 10 . This is connected with Revelation 1:9, which speaks of John being a "fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.'' "Endurance'' is used as a noun.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today is the time of Christ's endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today the Lord meets many who scorn Him, but He endures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His word today is the word of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here He has no reputation; He is a lowly person, still a Nazarene, still the son of a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we follow the Lord, He says that we should keep the word of His endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth'' 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can use Chungking for an illustration: To say that I will keep you from the bombing means that you will still be in Chungking, but that you will be kept from the bombing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If I say I will keep you from the hour, that means that before that hour you will have just left for Ch'eng-tu.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the whole world is being tried we all know that this refers to the great tribulation , we will not meet the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before that hour arrives, we will have been raptured already.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the whole Bible there are only two passages which speak of the promise of rapture: Luke 21:36 and Revelation 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today we must follow the Lord, not live loosely, learn to walk in the way of Philadelphia, and ask the Lord to deliver us from all the trials to come.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown'' 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord says, "I come quickly''; therefore, this church is to continue until the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thyatira is not gone, Sardis is not gone, and Philadelphia is not gone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"Hold fast what you have,'' which is "My word'' and "My name.''</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not forget the word of the Lord, and we should not put the Lord's name to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"That no one take your crown.''</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All of Philadelphia have the crown already.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the other churches it is a problem of gaining the crown; here it is a problem of losing it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord says that they already have the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the whole Bible only one person knew he had the crown Paul 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>So also among the churches, only Philadelphia knows that she has the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not let any man take your crown; do not come out from Philadelphia and leave your position.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Here it says to hold fast what you have that no man take it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This tells us clearly that Philadelphia also has her own particular danger; otherwise, the Lord would not have given her such a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Moreover, this danger is quite real, which is why the Lord commands her in such a serious manner.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What is her danger?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Her danger lies in losing what she already has.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>So the Lord asks her to hold fast what she has.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Her danger is not in failing to progress; rather, it is in retrogression.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Those in Philadelphia are pleasing to the Lord because they love one another and are faithful to the Lord's word and the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Their danger lies in losing this love and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How dreadful!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But in fact this is what has actually happened.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After twenty years the brothers were divided.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They were divided into two divisions: "Exclusive'' and "Open,'' and within the two divisions there are many sects.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, in Philadelphia there is also the call to the overcomers.</S>
