[2]  Volume 24 of The Collected Works is comprised of messages given by Watchman Nee in 1935.
[3]  With the exception of chapter four, the messages were delivered in Shanghai during September and October of that year.
[4]  These messages reveal the excellent Christ who is in us as our victory.
[5]  CHAPTER ONE OUR EXPERIENCE Scripture Reading: Rom 7:21; 3:23 THE LIFE THAT GOD HAS ORDAINED
[6]  The Bible shows us that God has ordained for every Christian a life that is filled with joy.
[7]  This life is completely at peace, has no barriers in its fellowship with God, and is not contrary to His will in any way.
[8]  The life that God has prepared for a Christian is one that does not thirst after the world.
[9]  Adultery is a sin of the flesh, undisciplined eyes are a sin of the flesh, and improper relationships with others are also a sin of the flesh.
[10]  The Lord has not come to deliver us from sin only, but also from our disposition.
[11]  God requires that we consecrate ourselves absolutely to Him.
[12]  He requires that we consecrate our wives and children to Him.
[13]  He also requires that we consecrate our business entirely to Him.
[14]  He requires that we consecrate all of our money to Him.
[15]  But dear brothers and sisters, we have to realize that in the Old Testament there was the ordinance of tithing, the offering of one tenth; in the New Testament our consecration should be ten tenths.
[16]  AS REVEALED IN THE BIBLE Scripture Reading: Eph 1:3 THE EXPERIENCE OF FAILURE
[17]  When we were saved, the grace of God filled our hearts with joy.
[18]  At that time, our life was filled with hope; we thought that from that point on, all our sins would be under our feet.
[19]  At the time we were saved, we thought that no temptation was too great for us to overcome and no difficulty was too much for us to surmount.
[20]  In the last message, we saw our experience in ourselves.
[21]  We are not talking about advanced Christians; we are talking about every saved and regenerated Christian, every Christian who has received the eternal life.
[22]  John 7:37 and 38 say, "Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.
[23]  He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."
[24]  They will not flow out of only special Christians or the apostles Paul, Peter, or John, but out of all those who believe, out of ordinary men like us.
[25]  Romans 8:35 says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[26]  Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?"
[27]  Verse 37 says, "But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us."
[28]  Oh, our Lord who loves us has more than conquered all these things!
[29]  But in our case, we do not need tribulation or swords to come upon us; as soon as someone gives us a bad look, we lose the love of Christ.
[30]  OF THE OVERCOMING LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 15:29 In Hebrew the phrase "the Strength of Israel" can be translated also as "the Hope of Israel."
[31]  The margin of ASV contains the phrase "the Victory of Israel."
[32]  In the Bible, victory is first mentioned in 1 Samuel 15:29, where it says that Victory will not lie nor repent.
[33]  Please remember that victory is a gift; it is not a reward.
[34]  The latter is given to us freely; it has nothing to do with what we have done, and we do not have to exert any effort to get it.
[35]  We can look at 1 Corinthians 15:57, which says, "But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[36]  The overcoming life is something that is obtained; it is not attained.
[37]  This matter can only be obtained; it can never be attained.
[38]  You may remember that Paul once said, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure" Phil 2:13 .
[39]  Whatever we work out is according to God's good pleasure.
[40]  It is God who causes us to work out everything.
[41]  We do not have to exert our own effort, because everything is accomplished through God working in us.
[42]  Such a holy and perfect life does not come about by our own effort; it is absolutely a work of God.
[43]  THE OVERCOMING LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Gal 2:20 NO LONGER I BUT CHRIST
[44]  Galatians 2:20 is a very familiar verse to us.
[45]  We know that the overcoming life is Christ, and we know that the overcoming life is Christ living in us.
[46]  The question we will address in this message is how to be joined to Christ, including what we should do before Christ can become our life and before He can live within us.
[47]  Yet I would ask one thing: While it is true that God has crucified us, what should we do and what process should we pass through before we can say in reality that we are crucified with Christ?
[48]  My intention is not to give a sermon this afternoon but to have a talk with you.
[49]  This is something that concerns all of us; it is not just something for me.
[50]  Why did God want to crucify us with the Lord Jesus?
[51]  I personally treasure this portion of the Word very much.
[52]  I hope that you will bear with me and consider what this passage is really speaking of.
[53]  There was a ruler who came to Jesus and asked for eternal life God's life.
[54]  The young ruler might have been able to fulfill five, fifty, or even five hundred conditions, but God put one thing in front of him to show him that he was not able.
[55]  Friends, the first step toward victory is to realize that we are not able.
[56]  Once we realize that we are not able, we have passed the first step.
[57]  Mrs. So-and-so, are you clear that you are not able? Have you realized your inability only after these twenty or more days? Thank God that you have finally learned that you are not able to do something.
[58]  I think we have to go one step further to consider something more.
[59]  Many brothers and sisters already know that they are not able to do anything.
[60]  Perhaps you know that you are not able to do anything.
[61]  But I must ask once again: Are you able, or are you not able?
[62]  There is no doubt that Christ will overcome for you, but there is a condition for His overcoming for you: You must not consider yourself able.
[63]  If you continue to say in your heart that you are able and that you can make it in yourself, Christ cannot live for you.
[64]  Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me."
[65]  Weakness is something that one should boast in. You may have said, "Thank and praise the Lord because He has made me overcome," but have you ever said, "Thank and praise the Lord because He has made me fail miserably"? You thank and praise the Lord for giving you patience, but have you thanked and praised Him for your impossible temper? Have you thanked and praised Him for your pride? Have you thanked and praised Him for your jealousy? Have you thanked and praised Him for your uncleanness within and for your sin? If you have these problems, you should thank and praise the Lord for them.
[66]  The first thing you must do is realize that you cannot make it.
[67]  The third thing you should do is thank and praise God for not being able to make it.
[68]  When you see that you cannot make it and that you are totally incapable of doing anything, and when you see that only the Lord can make it, you will thank and praise Him.
[69]  I told him that this was something to rejoice about and that he should thank and praise God for it.
[70]  If you had seen how I tried to quit, you would have realized my suffering.
[71]  I did not smoke, and I did not carry any cigarettes with me during that time.
[72]  If you could quit smoking today, you would be to the Lord like I am to you; you would not need the Lord.
[73]  During the past few evenings we have seen the kind of life that we live and the kind of life that God requires of us.
[74]  We have seen the human way of victory and God's way of overcoming.
[75]  We will first consider a very important question: How can we enter into the experience of this life and how can we gain Christ?
[76]  Tonight all the brothers and sisters who are sitting here have seen the fact of the cross.
[77]  We know that when the Lord was crucified on the cross, He not only took away our sins but also crucified our person.
[78]  We know that the matter of sin has been dealt with, and that we ourselves have been crucified with Him.
[79]  It is true that we are crucified with Christ, but why has this truth not produced an effect on us?
[80]  The Lord has brought me to the cross, but I am still I. I am still bound, and I am still weak.
[81]  Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that it is one thing for the Lord Jesus to accomplish salvation, and it is another thing for us to receive this salvation.
[82]  If we realize that the cross is our appraisal report, if we know that we are absolutely useless, and if we know that we are not even capable of having right thoughts, we will agree that we only deserve to die.
[83]  The cross tells us that God has given up hope in man!
[84]  The cross tells us that God is proclaiming, "I cannot improve man; I cannot correct him.
[85]  I met a sister yesterday who spent two hours telling me her history of failure.
[86]  Finally, I asked her, "Are you willing to concede now?
[87]  It is one thing for us to acknowledge that we cannot make it, but it is another thing for us to not try to make it.
[88]  "THE LIFE WHICH I NOW LIVE IN THE FLESH
[89]  I LIVE IN FAITH, THE FAITH IN THE SON OF GOD"
[90]  God says that I am utterly corrupt, and I also say that I am utterly corrupt.
[91]  God says that I am absolutely useless, and I also say that I am absolutely useless.
[92]  God says that I only deserve to die, and I also say that I only deserve to die.
[93]  Brothers and sisters, God cannot tell us to believe that which is unbelievable.
[94]  Some brothers and sisters will let go and resign when you ask them to do so, but they cannot believe.
[95]  While they say that they believe, they also say that they prefer to wait and see for a few days.
[96]  But a more important step is allowing the Lord Jesus to live out His victory from within us.
[97]  God says that if we believe that the Lord has died for us on the cross, He will give us eternal life, and if we believe that the Lord is living within us, He will give us the overcoming life.
[98]  I told her that if she believed in God's fact and if she believed that the Lord Jesus is the victory and that He lives in her, she should believe immediately that she has overcome.
[99]  In the same way, if you fulfill the condition for God to give you victory, if you let go, if you resign, and if you lose hope in yourself, you can immediately believe that you have received the overcoming life.
[100]  Although you may feel that you are cold and that there is nothing to smile about, you can still thank and praise the Lord, saying, "The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God."
[101]  Luke 18:27 says, "But He said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God."
[102]  In Luke 18:27, the Lord Jesus said that the things that are impossible with men are possible with God.
[103]  A young man came to the Lord and asked Him, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?" v. 18 . Since he asked what he should do, the Lord answered, "You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother'" v. 20 . The Lord mentioned five items.
[104]  He has discerned and realized that we cannot make it.
[105]  Brothers and sisters, what happens when we see the Lord's death for us on the cross, and what happens when we believe?
[106]  Similarly, when we see that the Lord has brought us to the cross and crucified us there, we will cease fighting and stop improving ourselves.
[107]  From now on I will not do anything, I will not manage anything, and I will not be concerned about anything.
[108]  Suppose you lose your temper every time you are agitated by others.
[109]  What are you going to do when someone continues to agitate you with his words, and the agitation grows increasingly worse?
[110]  "Lord, I do not take control of this matter; my temper is not my business; victory is Your business.
[111]  However, if you feel that you cannot bear the agitation, and you pray, "Lord, deliver me, for I am about to lose my temper," fifteen minutes will seem like fifteen hours to you.
[112]  Second Corinthians 12:9 says, "And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.
[113]  This shows us that we should not only consider ourselves weak, powerless, and incapable, but also rejoice in our weakness, powerlessness, and incapability.
[114]  Does this verse say that we should weep for our weakness?
[115]  No, on the contrary, it says that we should rejoice over our weaknesses, and we should not just rejoice but also boast in our weaknesses.
[116]  When I was about to leave, I asked again, "Do you think that you, Dr. Shi, can quit smoking?" He said no. I asked, "What then are you going to do?" He said, "The Lord will quit for me." At that word, I left in peace.
[117]  But there is not one verse in the Bible, not one word from God, that tells us that we should live a life which we are capable of living or that we should do what we are capable of doing.
[118]  CHAPTER SEVEN BELIEVING Scripture Reading: Gal 2:20; Heb 11:1 IN ORDER TO OVERCOME, ONE MUST BELIEVE
[119]  Today we will read only Galatians 2:20 and Hebrews 11:1.
[120]  During the past few days, we have seen that the overcoming life is simply Christ Himself.
[121]  The overcoming life is not an improvement or advancement in ourselves, and it is not a self-effort to strive to become like Christ.
[122]  Victory is Christ living within us; that is, it is Christ overcoming for us.
[123]  We believe that the Son of God lives within us, and we believe that He is living out His victory from within us.
[124]  This is the only verse in the whole Bible that gives the definition of faith.
[125]  "Now faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."
[126]  Ephesians 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."
[127]  Brothers and sisters, the main question hinges on faith; we have to believe that God's Word is true.
[128]  Now we need to ask what faith is not.
[129]  Those who have hope do not necessarily have faith.
[130]  When you talk to others about overcoming and ask whether they have overcome, you know that they do not have faith if they answer, "I hope I will overcome."
[131]  If he tells you that he hopes to be saved, you know that he does not have the faith yet.
[132]  The greatest problem among God's children today is that they cannot believe God's Word.
[133]  It is not that hard to ask them to let go.
[134]  Since they have let go, it should be an easy thing for them to believe.
[135]  After you have let go, you should have the faith that you will get through.
[136]  God has said that you are a branch and that if you let go, the Lord's life will spontaneously flow out of you.
[137]  Brothers and sisters, please remember that when we believe in the Lord as our Head and our life and believe that we have received everything, everything is indeed ours.
[138]  We believe that the Lord is the Head, that He lives in us, that He is our life, that He is the vine and we are the branches, and that He is overcoming for us.
[139]  Tonight I would like you to read one verse.
[140]  First Peter 1:7 says, "So that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[141]  Tonight I will speak on the proving of faith or the testing of faith.
[142]  The Bible shows us that there can be no faith without testing.
[143]  Satan will not easily concede that we have believed, and he will not allow us to say that we have obtained what we have believed in. He will always come to deceive and bother us.
[144]  After you have overcome and stopped sinning for a week, two weeks, three weeks, or even four or five weeks, you think that you have become good, that you have changed, and that you have matured.
[145]  You may begin to appreciate yourself and boast in yourself.
[146]  Therefore, God will give you a test and make you fail so that you will realize that you have not changed at all.
[147]  If you can endure anything, it is not because you have changed but because you are exchanged.
[148]  You have to realize that if there is any endurance in you, it is Christ who is enduring for you.
[149]  No matter how long you have overcome, you are still you; you will always be you, and you will never change.
[150]  I asked her whether Christ had changed, and she said no. I asked her whether God's Word had changed, and she said no. I said, "Since Christ has not changed and since God's Word has not changed, why are you not victorious?" She answered that it was because her experience did not match what she thought it should be.
[151]  One sister had the same problem as Mrs. Lee.
[152]  She said that she believed but could not overcome.
[153]  I told her that we need faith that moves the mountain.
[154]  Tonight we will consider another matter before the Lord, but before doing this, we have to review what we have seen.
[155]  We have seen that our experience has been a story of constant failures.
[156]  We have seen also that the life that God has ordained is a life that is far higher than our current Christian experience.
[157]  Third, we have seen that the overcoming life which God has given to us is Christ and that human ways, such as suppression, struggling, prayers, etc., are useless.
[158]  Fourth, we have seen that there are five characteristics to the overcoming life, the most important of which is that this life is a matter of exchange and not change.
[159]  When God says that His grace is sufficient for us, it is sufficient for us.
[160]  Second, our life should always be the same as it was on the first day we experienced the overcoming life.
[161]  Every morning when we wake up, we should say to the Lord, "God, I am still weak and powerless before You.
[162]  I have not changed; I am still the same.
[163]  Nevertheless, I thank You because You are still my life, and You are still my holiness and my victory.
[164]  God, I thank You because everything is according to Your grace, and everything has already been accomplished by Your Son."
[165]  Some brothers have asked whether this means that we will no longer sin after we have experienced victory.
[166]  My answer is that eventually we will realize everything in our practice.
[167]  But in the mean time, there is still the possibility of sinning.
[168]  According to the Bible, what kind of life should we live?
[169]  The Bible shows us that the life of a Christian is a life of faith.
[170]  I would like to bring to your attention 1 John 5:11-12, which says, "And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son.
[171]  He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life."
[172]  When God gives us His Son, He is not giving us just the prescription but the very Doctor Himself.
[173]  This is one of the few places in the Bible that speaks of growth.
[174]  For us to grow in grace means that we need God to do more things for us.
[175]  CHAPTER TEN THE TONE OF VICTORY Scripture Reading: Psa 20:5; 2 Chron 20:1, 3, 12, 15, 17-22, 24, 26-28
[176]  During the past few evenings, we have been considering the way for a Christian to overcome.
[177]  Last night we saw the way for the overcoming life to grow.
[178]  Today we will consider another subject, the tone of victory.
[179]  "And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the Lord: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.
[180]  Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
[181]  The great mistake that we make today is that we do not have the praise that is uttered before the victory; we hold back this praise and wait to see what happens.
[182]  We do not have to commit any great sin; as long as we do not boast in His victory and as long as we do not thank and praise, we have lost our victory.
[183]  James 1:2 says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, whenever you fall into various trials."
[184]  First Peter 1:6 says, "In which time you exult."
[185]  Verse 8 says, "Whom having not seen, you love; into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory."
[186]  In chapter four, verses 12 and 13 say, "Beloved, do not think that the fiery ordeal among you, coming to you for a trial, is strange, as if it were a strange thing happening to you; but inasmuch as you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice exultingly."
[187]  Matthew 5:11-12 says, "Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens." When others reproach us, we may endure it; when they persecute us, we may not speak back.
[188]  Philippians 4:4 says, "Rejoice in the Lord always."
[189]  In describing joy, the Bible either uses the word great, or full, or always.
[190]  If you have not heard it yet, let me repeat it for you: Again I will say, rejoice.'"
[191]  If we did not get it yet, he would repeat it once more that we should rejoice.
[192]  CHAPTER ELEVEN CONSECRATION Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:14-15; Rom 6:13, 16; 12:1-2; 6:19, 22
[193]  Tonight is the last evening of our conference on "The Overcoming Life."
[194]  There is one thing that we have to mention tonight.
[195]  The previous messages would not take us very far if we only stopped at last night's message.
[196]  However, we could not have addressed tonight's subject earlier, because it would not have been right to do so.
[197]  The first thing we have to do after we have experienced the overcoming life is to consecrate ourselves.
[198]  I can say only that since the Lord died for us and lives for us, the first thing we should do after we overcome is consecrate ourselves.
[199]  If we have not experienced the overcoming life, God will not receive our consecration even if we do consecrate ourselves, because everything we have is from Adam and is dead.
[200]  Consecration is spoken of not only in Romans 6 but also in Romans 12.
[201]  The first thing we should consecrate are the people we love.
[202]  If a man does not love the Lord more than his parents, wife, children, and friends, he is not worthy to be the Lord's disciple.
[203]  If you have consecrated yourself to the Lord, there should be no one in this world that can occupy your heart and nothing that can capture your heart any longer.
[204]  God saves you in order to gain you wholly.
[205]  God has given Christ to us as our overcoming life so that we would not only know His will but also obey it.
[206]  After she died, I found the following note in her Bible next to the verse, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" Matt 22:37 : "Lord, I thank You that there is such a commandment."
[207]  We have to consecrate not only people and affairs but also all objects.
[208]  There are people who have to consecrate their jewelry.
[209]  Others may have houses or clothing they have to consecrate.
[210]  Some may only have a very small thing to consecrate, but they cannot allow this small thing to become a hindrance to them.
[211]  There is nothing legal about this, but if we want to live a consecrated life, gold ornaments probably have to go, fashionable clothes have to go, and perhaps our money has to go.
[212]  The first result is described in Romans 6, and the second result is described in Romans 12.
[213]  Many people do not know the difference between the two.
