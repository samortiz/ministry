   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MULTIPLICATION OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's death not only releases the divine life, but also multiplies it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I regret that through the years I have not adequately ministered life to you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we are still short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This shortage of life is probably due to the fact that I have not died enough.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Life comes out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The divine life is within us, but how much this life is multiplied depends upon how much death we undergo.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more death we experience, the more life will be released from us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only death can bring about the multiplication of the divine life; power cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today's Christians devote their attention to power instead of to life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But only the death of Christ can multiply life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE FATHER BEING GLORIFIED</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through the death of Christ the Father is glorified John 12:28; 13:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ's death glorified the Father because it released the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The release of the divine life from within Jesus was the glorification of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Glory is God released and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, whenever the divine life within us is released, God is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The unique way to glorify God is to die.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more we are conformed to the death of Christ, the more we glorify the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians are taught that the way to glorify God is to behave themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the more you behave yourself, the more you receive the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You do not give any glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The only way to glorify God is to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then spontaneously the divine life within us will be released, and God the Father, the source of this life, will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE SAVING OF THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Another thing accomplished by the death of Christ is the saving of our soul John 12:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The only way to save our soul is to die.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more we die with Christ, the more we save our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>DRAWING PEOPLE TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through the death of Christ people are drawn to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After telling Philip that He would die as a grain of wheat falling into the ground, the Lord said, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself" John 12:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The words "lifted up" refer to the Lord's death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through His death the Lord would draw men to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The real attraction is in the dying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we die the death of Christ and are conformed to His death, we shall be a magnet drawing people to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The death of Christ on the cross has a lovable attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such an attracting, the proper attraction, is not a matter of stirring up people emotionally.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is an attraction that comes through the release of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When people contact us, they should be influenced by the divine life and realize that there is something within us different from anything that is in the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is something heavenly and divine within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the crucified life with its attracting power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every crucified person is a magnet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Wherever we are, we need to experience Christ in this way.</S>
