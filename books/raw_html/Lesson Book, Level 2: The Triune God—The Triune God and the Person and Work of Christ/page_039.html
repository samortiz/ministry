THE LAST ADAM</H2><P>First Corinthians 15:45b says that Christ was the last Adam. When Adam was created by God, he represented the entire human race. Through Adam's race God intended to fulfill His eternal purpose. But Adam failed God to the uttermost; instead of taking in God, he took in Satan, and thus brought all of mankind into a fallen condition. Instead of expressing God, man began to express Satan. So God had to terminate the first man Adam and all of Adam's race, which includes you and me. God accomplished this through Christ's death on the cross. Christ was the last Adam; after Him there were no more Adams. God could then start a new race with Christ as its Head in resurrection.</P><P>Adam was also the head of the entire creation. He was given the rule over all the created things. The heavens and the earth were made for Adam, and Adam was made to contain Christ. But Adam fell and brought the whole creation down with him (Rom. 8:20-22). Without Christ, man, the heavens, and the earth are vain, without purpose. This fallen creation is what we call "the old creation." When Christ died as the last Adam He also terminated the entire old creation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE PEACEMAKER</H2><P>Christ also died as the peacemaker. One of the results of man's fall was division. God wanted man to express Him in oneness, but man became separated into many races, nationalities, and classes. There are often hatred and fighting among these groups&#151;between black and white, German and French, rich and poor. The list is endless. The greatest difference is probably between the Jews and the Gentiles. The Jews have many ordinances (regulations) which separate them from other people. With all these differences, how could we all be one to express God? It is impossible. So Ephesians 2:14-16 tells us that on the cross Christ broke down all the dividing walls, abolished all the ordinances, and slew all the hatred between different people, races, and countries&#151;even between you and your brother or sister. Christ is the peacemaker. He nailed all our differences to the cross.</P><P>Now in Christ there is no Jew or Gentile, rich or poor, black or white (Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:11). The cross terminated all such differences. If such differences still bother us, that shows we have not experienced enough of Christ's crucifixion. People always talk about ending wars and ending prejudice, but without the cross it is impossible to end anything. If you are fighting with someone, the best way to end the fight is to have both of you die. That may sound funny but it is the truth. When you are both dead, how peaceful you would be&#151;there would be no more fighting! When Christ died as the peacemaker He crossed out everyone. We all died in Christ. This is why in the churches we can have people of every race, culture, and class. This is a glorious declaration of what the Lord Jesus did on the cross; by the cross we can be truly one. This oneness is real only in the Spirit. Therefore, whenever we have problems with people, we should turn to our spirit and allow the cross to terminate us.</P>
