   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WAY TO PURSUE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first aspect of the way to pursue Christ is that we do not consider ourselves to have gained.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Following this, we need to do one thing: forget the things which are behind and stretch forward to the things which are before.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The goal toward which we are pursuing is the full enjoyment of Christ, and the prize is the extra enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe this extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ will be in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the millennial kingdom the overcomers will enjoy Christ in an extraordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This extraordinary enjoyment of Christ corresponds to the out-resurrection in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This out-resurrection can be illustrated by the experience of a few members of a high school graduating class.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the time of graduation, a few outstanding students will enjoy an extra portion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although hundreds of students may graduate at the same time, only a small number will enjoy this special portion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In like manner, all believers who die before the Lord comes back will be resurrected, but some will enjoy an extraordinary resurrection, an outstanding resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul speaks of this as the out-resurrection from among the dead, a prize to those believers who are successful in running the New Testament race.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians hold the concept that as long as they are resurrected when the Lord comes back, they will not have any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This concept is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible reveals that all unbelievers will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to John 5:28-29, there are two classes of resurrection: the first class is resurrection to life, and the second is resurrection to condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the believers who have died will be resurrected unto life, that is, unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the unbelievers will be resurrected after the millennium unto condemnation, unto perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In light of the principle that there is more than one kind of resurrection, we should not say that simply because a person will be resurrected he will not have any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Resurrected believers as well as unbelievers may still face a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There will be a distinction not only between the resurrection of the believers and the unbelievers, but also a distinction among Christians at the time of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yes, we shall all be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But many will participate in resurrection merely in a common way; they will not enjoy the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will be like the majority of a high school graduating class.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Others, however, will enjoy the extra portion of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They will be like the few out of the graduating class who enjoy an outstanding graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some Christians may not agree with the interpretation that the goal and the prize in 3:14 are related to the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But no matter how we interpret this verse, the fact remains that there is a goal for us to reach and a prize for us to gain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not insist on my interpretation of this verse, but I would point you to the goal and the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to reach the goal and gain the prize, you must run in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, you will come short of the goal and fail to receive the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not be content with the fact that, as a believer, you will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes, you will graduate in resurrection, but will you have the extra portion of resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not be under the influence of the teaching popular with Christians today that all believers will be kings in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All true believers are eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, not all Christians will be on the same level as far as reward is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The time Christ comes back will be the time of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether or not we receive a reward from Him depends on how we run the race today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE GOAL FOR THE PRIZE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>OF THE HIGH CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have pointed out that the goal is the full enjoyment and gain of Christ and that the prize will be the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This prize is the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek word rendered high means above.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The high calling is the calling by God from above, from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a heavenly calling Heb 3:1 , corresponding to the heavenly citizenship in verse 20, not an earthly one like that given to the children of Israel in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This high calling is to take possession of Christ, whereas the earthly calling to the children of Israel was to take possession of a physical land.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have received not an earthly calling, but a high calling, a heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God has called us to gain Christ as our real land.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In typology, God called Israel with an earthly calling to gain the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now God has called us with a heavenly calling to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once again I wish to emphasize that we need to take care of certain facts in 3:14.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No matter how we may interpret Paul s word concerning the goal and the prize, we cannot deny that both are facts with certain points.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even if you do not agree with the interpretation that the prize is the top enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom, you still need to take care of the fact that there is a prize for you to obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To receive the prize we must reach the goal, and to reach the goal we must run the race.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These facts are of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As we consider these facts, we need to apply them to our situation according to the context of Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this chapter Paul shows us our need to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is the goal and also the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not be distracted by the effort to understand just what kind of prize you will obtain when you reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What is crucial is that you realize that, according to the divine revelation, God has set forth Christ as your goal and prize.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, He has called you to stretch forth toward the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some Christians may argue that the prize in 3:14 does not refer to enjoyment in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Again I say, even if you disagree with this interpretation, you cannot avoid the fact that God does have a prize for us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to the context of Philippians 3, both the goal and the prize are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Otherwise, why would Paul say that Christ had gained him so that he might gain Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In verse 12 he says, I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then in verses 13 and 14 he continues, Brothers, I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold, but one thing forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I urge you to care for the fact that God has set up a goal and prepared a prize.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I also urge you to care for the need to run a good race and to pursue Christ by forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forth to the things which are before.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I believe that the things which are before are things concerning Christ and His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Let us all forget the things behind and pay attention to the bright future ahead of us, a future of gaining Christ and experiencing Him to the uttermost in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not be satisfied simply with Bible knowledge, not even with the knowledge of Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to have the actual pursuing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Greek word for pursue can also be translated persecute.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Before Paul was saved, he was persecuting Christ in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After he was saved, he pursued Christ to such an extent we may even say he persecuted Christ, but in a very positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To persecute a person is to trouble him and refuse to let him go.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Before Paul was saved, he bothered Christ and would not let Him go, persecuting Him negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But after he was saved and had been gained by Christ, he still persecuted Him, but positively, for he refused to let Christ go.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We also should persecute Christ in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is to pursue Christ in order to gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Do not let Christ go.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Bother Him, persecute Him, in order to gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>To persecute Christ in this way is exhausting.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As we persecute Christ, we should spend ourselves completely.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our whole being with all of our strength should be consumed in pursuing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I hope that many among us will be impressed with the need to pursue Christ and be stirred up to seek Him even in a persecuting way.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do not allow Christ to get away from you, but seek Him, pursue Him, persecute Him in such a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then you will gain Him.</S>
