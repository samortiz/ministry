   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY BEING ACTIVE-PASSIVE TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to read Acts 2:40: And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do you believe this word, Save yourselves, is okay?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Could you save yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Could anyone of you, including Peter, save himself?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But according to the Bible, Peter charged the people to save themselves from this crooked or perverse generation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the King James Version, the theologians would surely have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To save yourself means you save yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you save yourself, this must be a kind of saving by your work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And to be saved by any kind of work is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Salvation is not by works; salvation is by faith through grace Eph 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why then does Peter say, Save yourselves ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ACTIVE-PASSIVE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose a message was given in a meeting exhorting people to save themselves from today s dark age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Could you take it?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Surely I would not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Salvation is by grace; I cannot save myself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Peter s time people were in a crooked, perverse generation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How could one fallen to the depth of a crooked generation save himself out of it?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you were drowning in the ocean, could you save yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one could do it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Darby s New Translation of the Bible says, Be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to English grammar you have the active voice and the passive voice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Save yourself is active voice; be saved is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both are imperative.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One is imperative active, and the other is imperative passive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, it is not only active or only passive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It includes both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is an active-passive voice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The grammar in English is not adequate; you need an active-passive voice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Be is active, but saved is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It does not mean that you save yourself, but that you are to be saved by something or someone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So it is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some might say active-passive is not good language, but I would say that the language should be improved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Language is a kind of culture, and culture depends upon invention and improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today we have a lot of new words that we didn t have two hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why the King James Version of the Bible is out of date.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You need a new translation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both the English language and the Chinese language have active and passive voice, but neither has an active-passive voice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Language is always according to human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you don t have a culture you won t have a language.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In human culture there is not such a thing as active-passive, but in God s economy active-passive is too great a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even in human culture, some things are really active-passive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose you are floating on the ocean and a boat comes by.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You cannot save yourself, but the boat comes to save you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But you have to want to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You have to cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you don t want to be saved people cannot save you regardless of what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Or if you do too much to help yourself, you cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you are drowning and someone comes to save you, you had better not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Just let him save you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Otherwise you may drown the both of you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the active-passive voice, and it has to be applied to our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the last meeting I did tell you not to go backward, not to go forward, and yet not to stay here.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then you wondered: What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Don t do anything!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Be saved!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The problem is this: as fallen human beings, either we wouldn t care for our salvation, or we would do everything to save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more we do to save ourselves, the more we cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The best way to be saved is to desire to be saved, yet don t do anything to save yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This principle is hard for you and me to apply.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps you were bothered by the two preceding messages.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the first I told you that your prayer is a trap, your reading of the Bible is a trap, and whatever you do even spiritually is a trap.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the second one I told you not to go forward, not to go backward, and yet don t stay where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Actually, what the Lord wants is that we return, we repent, and then let Him do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Not many believers would do this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Most would either forget about God, or they would turn to Him and do so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some might testify that they got saved thoroughly because they cried for two nights and fasted for three meals.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All of a sudden joy came to them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yes, a kind of joy came to them, but it was a joy created by themselves because they had been crying for two nights and fasting for three meals.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Surely they needed some happiness, and surely some joy would come to them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Another may simply say, O Lord, save me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many dear ones got thoroughly saved by this kind of quiet salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some of those who cried for two nights and were on fire for two months may have gone back to the beach.</S>
