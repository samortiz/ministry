[1]  CONTENTS Incarnation, Inclusion, and Intensification 1 Incarnation, Inclusion, and Intensification 2 An Extract of the Basic Divine Revelation in the Holy Scriptures The God-men's Divine Right to Participate in God's Divinity
[2]  In this message we will begin to consider the three stages of Christ, that is, the three periods of the history of what Christ is incarnation, inclusion, and intensification.
[3]  It was in resurrection that the very God embodied in Christ and mingled with His humanity was compounded with Christ's death, the effectiveness of Christ's death, Christ's resurrection, and the power of His resurrection to produce the compound Spirit.
[4]  Hence, the life-giving Spirit may be called the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit who includes divinity, humanity, the death of Christ and its effectiveness, and the resurrection of Christ and its power.
[5]  the Stage of Christ as the Life-giving Spirit
[6]  At this juncture we need to consider the way the four Gospels end. The Gospels end with a record regarding the resurrected Christ who has become the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit.
[7]  If the Lord had not come to them as the Spirit, they could have touched His physical body of flesh and bones and they could have embraced Him, but they could not have received Him by breathing Him in. In John 20 the resurrected Christ exhaled, breathing Himself out, and the disciples inhaled, breathing Him in. This indicates strongly that in resurrection He has become the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit.
[8]  The compounding of the Spirit took place when Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.
[9]  His resurrection produced the firstborn Son of God by uplifting the humanity of Christ into His divinity and by having Christ born of God Acts 13:33; Psa 2:7 , that is, by designating the seed of David Christ's human nature by the Spirit of holiness the divinity of Christ in the power of resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God Rom 1:3-4 .
[10]  In Christ's resurrection the Spirit of God was consummated to be the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b : the Spirit of Christ the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatized Christ Rom 8:9 ; the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, who is embodied in the pneumatized Christ as the life-giving Spirit; and the reality of resurrection, which is Christ Himself and the processed and consummated Triune God John 11:25; 1 John 5:6 .
[11]  Producing a Group of Redeemed Persons and Christ in the Second Stage Producing the Church
[12]  In the first stage, the stage of Christ in the flesh, Christ produced a group of redeemed persons, such as Peter and all the other disciples.
[13]  I am burdened that all the co-workers in the Lord's recovery would realize that we need to do a work of three sections.
[14]  IN THE HOLY SCRIPTURES OUTLINE To know the processed and consummated Triune God Matt 28:19: Incarnated to be the flesh the first God-man to express God in humanity John 1:14.
[15]  God was incarnated to be a God-man, and this God-man was anointed to be the Christ, the anointed One of God, to accomplish God's plan in His eternal economy Luke 4:18 .
[16]  God is mysterious, and He needs the Word to define Him.
[17]  As the Word of God He speaks God, and He is thereby the definition, explanation, and expression of God.
[18]  Christ is the life to His believers for them to live Him.
[19]  The Spirit is not only the life-giving Spirit but also the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .
[20]  The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for this Spirit contains the element of the divine life.
[21]  Verse 9 speaks of the Spirit of God dwelling in us, and verse 11 goes on to say, "If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you."
[22]  In its universal aspect the church is the universal Body of Christ to be His fullness.
[23]  The Body of Christ is the contents of the new man.
[24]  This means that the New Jerusalem will be the counterpart of Christ, the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[25]  The New Jerusalem is also the eternal expansion and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in the regenerated, transformed, and glorified humanity.
[26]  TO PARTICIPATE IN GOD'S DIVINITY Scripture Reading: John 3:15; Col 3:4; Eph 1:4; 2 Pet 1:4; Eph 4:23; Phil 2:5; 2 Cor 3:18b; Eph 3:8; 2 Cor 3:18a; Rom 8:29-30; Heb 2:10; Eph 1:5; Rom 8:23, 19; 1 John 3:2; John 1:12; Rom 8:14, 16 OUTLINE To participate in God's life John 3:15; Col 3:4.
[27]  First, as the God-men we have the divine right to participate in God's life.
