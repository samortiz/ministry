Apparently it is easy to read and understand this chapter. Actually, it is not easy to find the extract of this chapter. We can easily see the substance of John 18. After reading this chapter, we may be able to recite the events described in it. This chapter tells us that the Lord Jesus went to the garden, that He was betrayed by Judas, and that He was arrested, bound, brought to the high priest, and judged by him. Afterward, He was brought before Pilate, who did not find any fault with Him. These are some of the main points in chapter eighteen. But what is the extract of this chapter?<p>If we compare the opening of the Gospel of John with chapter eighteen, it will seem that chapter eighteen is much lower than chapter one and that it does not match it. John&#8217;s Gospel opens with the words: &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; Then we are told in 1:14 that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality. What is the connection between such statements in chapter one and the account in chapter eighteen? What connects these chapters? It is difficult to see the connection between chapters one and eighteen. In order to see the connection, we need to penetrate into the depths of the Gospel of John and find what is the extract of chapter eighteen. In this message and in the message following we shall attempt to get into the extract of this chapter.<h2 class=head1>THE EMPHASIS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN  CONCERNING THE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2><p>Before we come to chapter eighteen itself, we need to ask an important question: According to the Gospel of John, why did the Lord Jesus die on the cross? As Christians, we may immediately respond by saying that the Lord Jesus died to accomplish redemption for us. On the cross He took away the sin of the world. This answer, of course, is correct. However, in the Gospel of John the emphasis is not on the Lord&#8217;s death for redemption. I do not mean by this that this Gospel says nothing concerning redemption. John 1:29 clearly speaks of the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. My point is that in John&#8217;s Gospel the emphasis with respect to Christ&#8217;s death is not on redemption. This is the emphasis in the synoptic Gospels-Matthew, Mark, and Luke-but it is not the emphasis in the Gospel of John. What, then, is the emphasis concerning the Lord&#8217;s death in the Gospel of John? Not many Christians can answer this question.<p>If the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery were to try to answer this question regarding the purpose of the Lord&#8217;s death in the Gospel of John, they may give different answers. Some may say that the Lord died to enlarge Himself as God&#8217;s dwelling place, that He died to glorify Himself or to release the divine life from within Himself, or that He died to become the life-giving Spirit. Such answers, although somewhat close to the truth, may be according to the doctrines the saints have learned in the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_198.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_200.html">Next</a> </body></html>
