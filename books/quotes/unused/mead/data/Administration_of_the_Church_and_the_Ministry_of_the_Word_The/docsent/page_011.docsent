   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having the Greatest Form of Pride</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who live in the workers home are bright and capable.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They seem to be independent and do not need others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is very dangerous because it is the greatest form of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If four brothers are living in the workers home, they should depend on one another, and others should sense their dependence on one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sadly, this is not the atmosphere among us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, if it is my turn to preach the gospel, I will either do everything or do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the human perspective, this may be considered to be coordination, but this coordination is according to regulation and arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no sense of needing others in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may think that coordination is unnecessary and troublesome and that it is better to not coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who do not need to coordinate are dry, lack blessing, and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that we are clever, capable, and do not need one another s help is a great danger.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a sad and pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fearful thing is that this situation is hidden and not very apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This situation can be compared to leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If it is manifested, it is easier to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shows that we lack the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we come together, we seldom have thorough fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, when saints from other cities visit Taipei, we sit together for a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the meeting, however, we all go our separate ways without fellowshipping.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was not our situation during our first six years in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In those years, whenever we had a conference, we came together and had much fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we are all capable, brilliant, and knowledgeable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not need one another; we do not need to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the greatest form of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the most offensive thing to the Lord and to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should humbly minister to others and restrict our cleverness through coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Needing Fellowship and Coordination</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>in the Body and in Life</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we lose the principle of coordination and dependence in the Body, we will not be strong in our administration of the church and ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we lose this principle, we will not have much blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our coordination should not become mechanical, and we should not work only when it is our turn.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should have the feeling that we cannot do anything without others, that we truly need one another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we come together and assign work, with each doing only his own work, our situation is similar to the division of labor in a civic organization or a large institution.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This lack of the flavor of coordination among the members of the Body must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What does it mean to see the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The greatest indication that we see the Body is that we cannot be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We feel that we need the Body, that we need the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Presently, however, our coordination can be compared to work in an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It seems that we are moving like a machine and that we lack the sense of the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lack of Coordination Producing Criticism</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we lack coordination with others, we will always criticize what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if we do not express it, we are filled with criticism, and we disapprove of what others do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such people are narrow and pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In our service we should not expect others to be like us, nor should we expect to be like others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, because we lack coordination in our service and do not rely and mutually depend on one another, we often step on others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We either do not walk, or we step on others when we do walk.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We either do not work, or we do the job of others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We either are not concerned, or we criticize the work of others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When a certain matter is in other s hands, we are not able to do anything, but when an opportunity comes to us, we do it according to our way and discard the help of others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although this condition is not apparent among us, it will be in our future, because we are not willing to submit to others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a foolish way.</S>
