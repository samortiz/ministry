   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION TWENTY-SIX CONCERNING ROMANS 5:9 AND 4:25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does it mean to be justified by the blood?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rom 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What does it mean to be justified by resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 5:9 says that we have "now been justified in His blood."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 4:25 says that Jesus "was raised for our justification."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can we tie these two verses together?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to examine the meaning of "justified in His blood" and the meaning of "raised for our justification."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How wide is the scope of justification in the blood and the scope of justification by resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Justification, according to the Bible, has two meanings: 1 A believer has been forgiven of his sins, and 2 God sees him as righteous or perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before Adam and Eve sinned, they were not justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is righteous and perfect in God's sight.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God tells every Christian who comes before Him that he not only is a forgiven sinner but he is also righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he comes before God, he is not only free from any defilement of sin, but he is also clothed with the robe of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone who comes before God in Christ is accepted by God just as Christ is accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What are the differences between justification by the blood and justification by resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The problem of our record of sins is resolved by the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He shed His blood to nullify our record of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time, we are accepted by God through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many Christians commit a big error in thinking that forgiveness includes everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should, no doubt, rejoice in the forgiveness of sins, but God gives us more than just the forgiveness of sins in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Forgiveness alone is not full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some have said that if they could only reach heaven, they would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Others have said if they could only stand at the gate of heaven, they would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If this is their concept, they surely do not know what the grace of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible tells us that the grace of God includes not only forgiveness of sins but also a most glorious truth: when we come before God, we are accepted in His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesians 1:6 says, "He graced us in the Beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not only forgiven; we are also accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The thief who was saved at the time of his death was accepted by God as much as the apostles John, Peter, and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the eyes of God, whoever is in Christ is not only blameless but also without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is a blemish?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose that I cut my hand with a knife.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the wound has healed, a scar still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The damage no longer exists, but the scar proves that at one time there was an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible tells us that God is able to save us to the point that we do not have any scars.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God can save us to the extent that we will not be reminded of our sinfulness or be condemned about it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's work is always perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He does not merely forgive our sins; He also saves us and makes us righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The blood is for redemption before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The blood purifies man's conscience Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we think of our sins, we can recall that the blood has washed us, and our heart will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the subjective effect of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus shed His blood to propitiate for our sins before God; this solved the problem of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The blood of the Lord Jesus also cleanses our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is the conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we sin, there is a voice within us that points out our sin and makes us feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The blood of the Lord is able to purify our conscience to the point that we no longer have a conscience burdened by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there is a Christian who is constantly living under the accusation of his conscience, this is not humility.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, this indicates an unbelief in God's Word as well as a scorn of Christ's work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>None of us should have a conscience under the accusation of our past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should believe that the blood has washed all our sins away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once there was a woman who was over fifty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>More than twenty years before, she had committed a most disgraceful sin, which lasted for a period of several months.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although she later repented, there was always condemnation within her that the sin she had committed could never be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, she had no peace at all.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then she met a preacher and told him how often she felt distressed for that sin and could not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The preacher asked her if she had ever read 1 John 1:7, and she said that she had.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then the preacher said, "Let us read together the last clause of that verse: The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.'</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Besides that particular sin, have you committed any other sins?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She said, "I have indeed committed other sins, but all of them have been cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, this sin remains uncleansed."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He said, "My Bible says, Cleanses us from every sin,' not cleanses us from other sins.'"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then he read verse 9 with her: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After reading it, he asked, "How does such a faithful and righteous God forgive and cleanse your sins?"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>She said, "By confessing my sins."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"Have you confessed?" he asked.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>She responded, "I have confessed tens and hundreds of times."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then he said, "Well, God says that if you confess your sins, He will forgive and cleanse.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You have already confessed, and God has already forgiven and cleansed you."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>She said, "I do not feel so."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He asked, "Does it really matter how you feel if God in heaven has forgiven and cleansed you?"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She said, "No, it really does not matter."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Later they prayed together, and he said to her, "Prayer is effective only if you believe what is in the Bible; if you do not believe it, it is futile even if you pray."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He then entrusted her to God with a few simple words, asking God to make her believe that her sins had already been forgiven and cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Her prayer declared, "O God, my problem before was that I could not believe in the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Now I do believe in Christ's work.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I believe in Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, my sin has been forgiven and cleansed."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When someone later met this sister and asked her how she was, she said, "Very fine indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Very fine!"</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Since many people have not seen this point clearly, they look daily at their sins instead of the sinner's Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They look daily at their sins instead of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They look daily at their sins instead of Christ's work.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Those who are more concerned with their own sins are the ones who sin more readily.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we look away unto the Lord Jesus and believe in the work He has done, we will surely forget our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our salvation hinges upon looking away unto the Lord and not upon our consideration of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The more we pay attention to a sin, the harder it will be to remove that sin.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But if we look away to the Lord, we will be transformed from glory to glory, even into the Lord's image.</S>
