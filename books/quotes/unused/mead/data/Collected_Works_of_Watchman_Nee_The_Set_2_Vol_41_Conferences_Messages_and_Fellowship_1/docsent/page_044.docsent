   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Way to Deal with Sudden Temptations</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is no time to prepare for sudden and instantaneous temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, we cannot deal with them on the spur of the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Long before this kind of temptation comes, we have to set up our defense.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In warfare between two nations, one cannot prepare for battle only after the enemy has started to attack.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One has to set up a defensive line well ahead of time and ask for the Lord's deliverance ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every morning, we have to pray to the Lord and ask Him to deliver us from sudden temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to ask Him to deliver us from temptations that do not afford us a chance to think about them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Often a person sins because he has not been put on alert ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, the Lord sometimes allows temptations to come upon us suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When such temptations come, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to remember that faith is a shield Eph 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not a pair of pliers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many people use faith as if it were a pair of pliers; they try to pull out the darts that have already been lodged into the body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But faith does not function like pliers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Faith is a shield.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is something placed between ourselves and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When darts come, they hit the shield and bounce back.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not put a shield behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the shield is at our backs, it will be difficult to protect us from the darts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every morning you have to lift up this faith before God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then you will withstand temptations without even being conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Very few Christians know what the shield of faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need the shield of faith even before temptations come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the first thing you do in the morning is to believe, you are holding up the shield of faith, and the darts from Satan will be knocked down.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you lift up your faith in this way to withstand the enemy day by day, you will find one day that glorious day that many darts were knocked away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 1 3 is on man's sin, while Romans 4 5:15 is on God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 5:12 tells us that we sin because we share the life of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why we sin without any effort of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no need for us to exert any effort to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The minute we are provoked, we lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no need for us to make up our mind to sin, because we share the same sinful life as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 5:15 says, "But it is not that as the offense was, so also the gracious gift is; for if by the offense of the one the many died, much more the grace of God and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ have abounded to the many."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the past, our old man was joined to Adam, but today the Lord has made us one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the past, we sinned without any consciousness of it, but today we can be patient, humble, and loving without being conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This proves the reality of our union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as we sinned spontaneously and effortlessly when we were in Adam, we can overcome spontaneously and effortlessly when we are in Christ and joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way the life of Christ is lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We will marvel at the transcendency and power of the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we believe, the life of Christ will be manifested in us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Dealing with Gradual Incremental Temptations</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The second kind of temptations are gradual and incremental.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan gives us suggestions gradually and a little at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These temptations are incremental in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no need to ask the Lord for strength to overcome this kind of temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The best way to deal with it is to stand on the ground of a sinner as soon as they come.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should take the stand of a patient who is looking for a doctor and who commits his whole being to the doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should speak to the Lord like a patient: "My mind and thoughts are inclined toward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am prone to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I cannot resist anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I ask You to resist for me."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to take the stand that we have died with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Satan may come with different kinds of temptations, but the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He does not need to make us sin directly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The goal of his temptations is to instigate us to act by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our position is in Christ; this is the only safe spot.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we remain in this position and allow the Lord to do everything, Satan will not be able to do anything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But once we move, even in things like praying, asking the Lord to strengthen us to resist the temptation, or making up our minds not to sin, we will find Satan prevailing over us and defeating us because we have moved out of the safety zone.</S>
