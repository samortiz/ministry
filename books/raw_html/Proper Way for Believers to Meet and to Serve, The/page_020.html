        <h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL BEING AN ITEM<br />
IN THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; DAILY SPIRITUAL LIFE</h2>
<p>The proper way to preach the gospel as revealed in the Bible is to go and visit people. The question is whether we are willing to go. We need to ask ourselves whether we are saved, whether we belong to the Lord, whether we love Him, and whether we want to meet Him at His return. Since the answers to all these questions are affirmative, what will we tell the Lord at His return concerning His commission to us to preach the gospel?</p>
<p>Hence, we must have a new beginning to live a normal life before the Lord. We must not continue to live the way that we did in the past. At that time we knew that we needed to preach the gospel, but because we lacked enthusiasm and our spirit was low, we needed the gifted ones to stir us up. We no longer need to be stirred up; we only need to breathe. It is easier for us to breathe on our own than it is for us to be stirred up. Do not expect me to lead a revival meeting; I do not have such a burden. We need to live a normal life. A person cannot become strong and healthy in one day. The way to be healthy is to live a normal, regular life. Preaching the gospel is a normal item in the spiritual life of a Christian. It is not a special act.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO PREACH THE GOSPEL REGULARLY</h2>
<p>In order to have a normal spiritual life, we must first tell the Lord that we desire to live by preaching the gospel. People do not work seven days a week. In the United States people work only five days a week. If we are willing to preach the gospel, we have to consecrate ourselves to the Lord and set aside a little time to knock on doors every week. We simply need to be persistent. Furthermore, we must deal with the Lord before we go out. Strictly speaking, we should not wait until we are about to go out before we deal with the Lord. We should fellowship with the Lord and let Him deal with us daily. Before going out we should have further dealings with the Lord. Without sufficient prayer and dealings, we will not be filled with the Holy Spirit, and as a result, people will not open their hearts to us. When we have proper dealings with the Lord, people will open their doors and their hearts to us. Moreover, the Holy Spirit will be one with our speaking.</p>
<p>I can say assuredly that if we would practice going out once a week to preach the gospel, we would gain four people a year; we would lead them to salvation and meet with them once a week. Whether we would lead four people to be baptized within one week or would need to spend two months in order to gain them, we should not become self-satisfied or conceited to think that we can lead several more people to be baptized. According to the parable of the sower, many people will hear the gospel, but it will not bear fruit in everyone. Hence, we may gain six or seven people, but two or three of them might not remain. Whatever the case may be, we will gain at least four people every year if we practice this fellowship.</p>
<p>Every successful person does things in a normal, regular manner. A student who studies only when he is happy will never be able to obtain a doctorate degree. In order to be a successful student, a person must have a plan and regularly spend a substantial amount of time to study. Instead of studying until he is exhausted, he should study a little and rest a little. I hope that we will learn to preach the gospel in this way.</p>
<p>We love the Lord, but we did not receive definite help concerning preaching the gospel. The first time I went to the Philippines, I helped the saints determine how many people they would bring to the Lord within a year. Most of the saints promised to bring one person. However, the situation in the Philippines, Taiwan, and the United States is the same: everyone makes a resolution to bring one person to the Lord every year, but in the end, not one church has had success in this matter. I later realized that although I led the saints to preach the gospel, I did not give them a definite way to practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEFINITE STEPS FOR PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Revived</h2>
<p>It is not difficult to preach the gospel, because it depends on our living. In order to preach the gospel, we first need to be revived; otherwise, our spirit will not be strong.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living an Overcoming Life</h2>
<p>After being revived, we need to live an overcoming life. Some people think that it is difficult to overcome. To live an overcoming life is to walk according to the spirit. When we get up every morning, we should first think of the Lord and call on His name and then spend ten minutes to read two verses and pray over them. By praying over the verses, we will be supplied with spiritual air, water, and bread. This is a good way to begin our morning. We also need to walk according to the spirit during the day. This is the way to have an overcoming living.</p>
<p>Without a good beginning we will not be able to overcome in our homes when dealing with our spouse or children, nor will we be able to overcome in our dealings with those outside our home. We might overcome gross sins, but we will fail in the trivial matters of our daily living. A brother might give his wife a rude stare when she says something inappropriate. This kind of response is of the devil. Some might even throw their chopsticks, shout abusively, or refuse to eat dinner. When we lack fellowship with the Lord and do not walk according to the spirit or live in the spirit, being rude or getting angry becomes our living. But if we have fellowship with the Lord and walk according to the spirit, we will not be able to stare rudely. When we live in the spirit, the Lord will not permit us to look at others&rsquo; shortcomings. He will cause us to look first at ourselves.</p>
<p>It is simple for Christians to live an overcoming life. I have been a Christian for more than sixty years. In my early years the books I read said that it is difficult to overcome and that we must endeavor, pray desperately, and fast repeatedly. But after I began pursuing and experiencing life, I realized that the authors of those books were blind guides leading people to walk blindly. Now I can say that overcoming is not difficult; it depends on whether or not we want to overcome. Suppose a person has been ill for many years, and there is now medicine that can heal his illness. If he wants the medicine and takes it, he will immediately be healed. The medicine will not heal him if he merely studies its content without taking it. As long as he will take the medicine, it will work even if he does not know what it is.</p>
<p>In an earlier chapter I pointed out that regeneration, the inward filling of the Holy Spirit, and the outward filling of the Holy Spirit are miraculously normal things. An overcoming life is also miraculously normal. The question is whether or not we want to live such a life. Perhaps some would say, &ldquo;We want to, but we do not understand it. We will accept it after we understand.&rdquo; There is no need to wait or to understand. On the day that Jesus went to Jericho, Zaccheus did not know who Jesus was. Zaccheus may have heard people saying that Jesus was good and therefore wanted to see Him. Thus, there is no need to understand; all that is required is that we receive.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
