   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>24 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE MARRIAGE OF ISAAC A PRACTICAL LIVING IN ONENESS WITH THE LORD And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 24:2-4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible reveals that God's eternal purpose is to express Himself through a corporate Body and that this purpose is fulfilled by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we would probe into the depths of the book of Genesis, we must see these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis 1:26 we see that man was made in God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The man here is not an individual man but a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may say that it is mankind, a corporate Body that can express God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis 2 we see that for the fulfillment of God's purpose we must have the divine life signified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In these two chapters we have two crucial words image and life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Image reveals God's eternal purpose, and life unfolds God's way of fulfilling His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Never consider Genesis as merely the record of God's creation and the history of some patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This view is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we plunge into the depths of this book, we see that it is not merely a record of creation and history, but that it is a revelation of God's eternal purpose and His way of fulfilling it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With these two points in mind, let us now come to Genesis 24.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everyone who reads Genesis thinks of this chapter as the record of a marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the important thing here is not the marriage but what the marriage indicates, implies, and typifies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we were on Genesis 1 and 2, we saw that those chapters are not only a record of God's creation but a record of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything found in those chapters is related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anything that is not related to life is excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you read those chapters carefully, you will see that many aspects of God's creation are omitted because they are not related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same principle, only those aspects of Abraham's history which are related to life are recorded in chapters twenty-one through twenty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The entire book of Genesis, a book of only fifty chapters, covers over twenty-three hundred years, the first twenty-three centuries of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If Genesis were a record of history, it would need hundreds of chapters to cover this span of time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The fact that such a long period is covered in just fifty chapters proves that Genesis is not a record of history.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I say again that although Genesis apparently is a record of history, it actually is a record showing God's eternal purpose and the way of fulfilling it by life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything which is not related to God's purpose and its fulfillment by life is not recorded in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Chapters twenty-one through twenty-four, covering forty years 25:20 , mention five main things: the birth of Isaac, the growth of Isaac, the offering of Isaac, the death and burial of Sarah, and the marriage of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although this record is brief, it is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we see a proper birth and the proper growth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This birth and growth produced a burnt offering for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the birth and growth in chapter twenty-one, we have the burnt offering in chapter twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, as we have seen, in chapter twenty-three we have the death of Sarah and a detailed account of her burial.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Following this, in chapter twenty-four, we see a wonderful marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But this chapter is not merely the record of a marriage; it is a story which has a deep meaning and significance in life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the common understanding of most Christians, the main point of this chapter is that Isaac is a type of Christ as the Bridegroom and that Rebekah is a type of the church as the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, this is not the main point.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The primary point is the practical living in oneness with the Lord for the fulfilling of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not understand the Bible according to our common knowledge or tradition, but come back to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever we read any portion of the Scriptures, we must forget all we have learned in the past and look to the Lord for something new.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Fifty years ago I read Genesis 24 carefully, doing my best to remember every point.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, when I come to this chapter now, I do not care for what I had in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I like to come to this portion of the Word as if I were reading it for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I can testify that just recently I have seen something new in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Have you ever realized that in Genesis 24 we can see a practical living in oneness with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we have seen, God has a purpose, and the way to fulfill His purpose is by life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These are the two governing points in understanding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would understand Genesis 24, we must apply these two governing points.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why does Genesis 24 give us such a record of Isaac's marriage?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we only read chapter twenty-four we cannot see the purpose of this record.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to answer this question we must read the three foregoing chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Genesis 21:12 says, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God called Abraham with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For the fulfillment of this purpose, God promised to give Abraham the good land and the seed which would inherit the land.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's eternal purpose is to express Himself in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to have this corporate expression, God must have a people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This people is the seed of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, in order to have the people to express God corporately there is the need of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What then is the purpose of the marriage in Genesis 24?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Is it simply that a single man might have a happy, comfortable life?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No. If you consider the Bible as a whole, you will see that Isaac's marriage was altogether for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Without marriage, how could Isaac have brought forth the seed?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If this single man was to have seed for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose, he had to get married.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After Abraham had been tested in chapter twenty-two, God said, "In blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed" 22:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here we also have the seed for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Thus, Isaac's marriage was not common nor merely for his human living; it was for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
