   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER FROM DAIREN, MANCHURIA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Yueh Chiao:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we have never met, I have known you for a long time in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank the Lord, when I had no way out, He showed me the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But while I was about to obey, as Hymn #68 in the Little Flock Hymnal says in stanza two, "Satan undermine d the way."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a consequence, the meeting in Dairen stopped for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of this we were weak in life, and sometimes we fellowshipped with the brothers and sisters in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we could never gain what we wanted in our innermost parts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As for myself, I just read the Bible in a sloppy way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are so weak, how will we be able to do what we want to do?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I myself know that I have not been baptized I was baptized five years ago by sprinkling in the Lutheran Church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Two years ago, I debated strongly with the obedient brothers in Chefoo, and I even ridiculed them concerning the doctrine of baptism by immersion after sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I thought I held the proper truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was so very proud!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My name is still on the books of a denomination in Pei Sui Hua County, Harbin .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I know that I should inform them of my desire to leave as a testimony that I am renouncing the sin of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are two testimonies before man that cannot be compromised in expressing one's obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope all the brothers and sisters earnestly pray for us and ask the Lord to revive us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I respectfully greet you and Brother Witness Lee, whom I saw in Chefoo, and all the brothers and sisters.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have not received a letter from them for a long time.</S>
