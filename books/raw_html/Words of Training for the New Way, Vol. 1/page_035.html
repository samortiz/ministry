 <h2 class="head1">TO BE ONE CALLING, ENJOYING,<br />
AND EXPERIENCING THE LORD REGULARLY<br />
AND IN A NORMAL WAY</h2>
<p>According to my own experience, to be filled with the Spirit does not require much struggling or striving. You do not need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I am too weak. I cannot help loving the world. I cannot free myself from my family affairs. I cannot drop my burdens. Lord, I can only be a fallen, backsliding Christian. Besides, I am no good in anything...&rdquo; It is useless to pray this way. You need to realize that God in the economy of His spiritual life wants us to be those who call on the Lord, enjoy Him, and experience Him regularly and in a normal way.</p>
<p>Therefore, every morning when you get up, you should call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; to begin your spiritual breathing. You should call in this way all day long. Also, you cannot separate the word of the Lord from the Spirit of the Lord. Even the more, you cannot separate the Spirit of the Lord from the Lord Himself. The Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word. Not only did God come down to the earth from the heavens, and then from the earth to Hades; He also ascended to the heavens from Hades and became a life-giving Spirit. In the universe, among the human race, there is also the word of God written and printed here, and it has been left in our hands. Therefore, every morning as soon as we wake up, we need to call on Him and also receive His word. During the day, we simply do these two things: contact the Lord and receive His word. This is what is spoken of in <em>Hymns,</em> #501, stanza 4, which says:</p>
<p class="hbody">The Spirit of life causes Thee<br />
By Thy Word to transfer to me.<br />
Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received,<br />
Thy life in me is thus conceived.</p>
<p>We do not need much begging and groaning. I exhort you sisters who are housewives not to be bothered by your talkative husband, your troublesome children, and the endless household chores. All these are for the purpose of compelling you to call on the Lord. Today the Spirit is within us, and the Word is in our hands. All we need to do is to call on the Lord moment by moment and receive His word day by day. Then many of the problems will not exist. When we are weak, we feel that everything is difficult. When we are strong, however, we feel that nothing is difficult.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the Lord as the Spirit is already in your mouth and in your heart. The Lord as the Word is also already in our hands and within us. Now you only need to receive the word and contact this Spirit, and the Lord will become your supply. Then day by day you will be saved and filled with the Holy Spirit, and you will allow the Holy Spirit to descend upon you. This should be your daily experience, which is normal, yet miraculous. Brother Moody once said, &ldquo;The greatest miracle in the universe is that man can be regenerated.&rdquo; Truly, regeneration is a great thing in the universe. Every day in the spiritual life, we can experience this great thing in the universe. It is miraculous, yet normal. Therefore, it is a miraculous normality.</p>
