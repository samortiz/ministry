In this book we want to fellowship concerning our need to pick up the new way to practice the Lord's present recovery
In order to meet the Lord's present need, we must enter into two portions of His Word: 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4:11-16
To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, and in our speaking for the Lord, we have to speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into others
The subject of 1 Corinthians 14 is prophesying, which is speaking Christ forth into others, dispensing Christ into others by our speaking
Our calling on Him is to receive Him, to breathe Him in, to enjoy Him, and to take Him as our portion for our daily practical needs
Every day and every minute, we need this Christ as our support, as our supply, so we have to call on Him all the time
Corinthians shows us that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus to enjoy Him, this enjoyment issues in the growth in life
Our eating of the nourishing food issues in the growth in life so that the problems within our physical body may be solved
A newborn babe has ears, eyes, hands, and legs, but without the adequate growth, these members will not be able to function adequately
Every member has its own function, but in the Body of Christ the top function is to speak for Christ, to prophesy
Our entire physical body with every member is functioning, and this functioning has one goal-to build up our body
Paul, however, strongly belittles the gift of speaking in tongues and exalts the gift of prophecy to the uttermost
The factor of begetting has kept the human race going on from one man whose name was Adam to billions of people
Day after day week after week month after month and year after year the evil one Satan has been using tradition to slaughter and annul us
Concerning the preaching of the gospel, we are fully clear that we need to go to visit people by knocking on their doors
There are many ways to preach the gospel, but visiting people by knocking on their doors is the top way for preaching the gospel
They said that preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes is according to the New Testament plan and will never be improved on
Out of this one million they intend to baptize seventy thousand to make them members of the Southern Baptist denomination
Peter took advantage of the situation on the day of Pentecost to speak to thousands of people, and three thousand were added in one day
A spiritual giant may have big campaigns for the preaching of the gospel, but what is the real result for the building up of the church?
Tradition has killed us, cheated us, and deceived us, so we must come back to the ordained way of perfecting all the saints
Anyone can move his fingers on the keys of a piano, but to learn how to play the piano, a person must be perfected
Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 are particular chapters in the New Testament regarding the building up of the Body of Christ
Brother Nee saw this matter over fifty years ago in 1937, but he told us he could not find a way to practice it
After four years of study beginning in 1984 in Taipei, the Lord has given us a clear view of 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4
The writer encourages the receivers of his Epistle to pursue, to desire, to seek, to excel, and to learn to prophesy
We need to pursue, desire, seek, and learn so that we may excel in prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ
The leading ones would charge them and urge them to speak, but they did not know how to speak or what to speak
From these notes we can have a topic to compose a short prophecy which is good for us to speak for three minutes
We have the Recovery Version which is a properly translated New Testament with notes that open up the text and many helpful cross-references
We are like carpenters who have the best tools to do the best carpentry to be 'an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
If we take the way of composing something to prophesy we will have something to present to the saints in the church meetings every Lords Day
Someone who realizes he should not speak first will wait for the appropriate time to speak his prepared prophecy
For Paul to teach the saints publicly means there was some public exhortation, probably in front of the saints as a congregation
An apostle should not only speak publicly but also go to the saints' homes day and night to perfect them, to teach them mouth to mouth
Where is the reality of such a verse on the earth today, and where can we see a meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14:26?
In the early church, there was such a reality for a short time, but it disappeared through the degradation of the church
It is much easier to remain in the old way because something has been set up, and every week they can do a routine work
They can routinely make the announcements about the scheduled times of the meetings, and appoint certain brothers to speak in the meetings
It may not be out of their heart to criticize or out of their intention to oppose, but their old habit is the problem
No one can deny that there are many ways to preach the gospel, but the top way is to visit people where they are by knocking on their doors
We should go to their homes and speak to them concerning God, Christ, the Bible, the gospel, salvation, grace, and redemption
They were touched that some would suffer to go out in such heavy rain to come to their home to preach the gospel
We need to have small group meetings to take care of the saints and to teach them the truth for their edification
According to the principle of the Bible, it is better that every week we have one day for the church to come together
If one third of the saints in a meeting of fifty to one hundred saints would prophesy, the time would be filled up with the riches of Christ
The growth in life first issues in the precious materials for God's building and then in the development of the gifts
The ultimate consummation of the enjoyment of Christ for the growth in life is the church built with the materials and by the skills
In the first verse of chapter fourteen, Paul says, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy'
In chapter thirteen Paul made love higher than all the gifts, but in chapter fourteen he made prophesying more desirable
In verse 12 he says, 'Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church'
To speak in tongues is purely miraculous and does not require any learning, but to prophesy is a miraculous normality
The book of Ephesians presents the teaching given to the saints in Ephesus, while Acts 20 presents the practice of the writer
If Paul had not taught the Ephesians to prophesy, how could he have said that he declared all the counsel of God to them?
Surely Paul taught the Ephesians concerning the excelling gift of prophecy as a part of the entire counsel of God
When Paul was teaching the saints publicly and from house to house in Ephesus, he surely instructed them how to prophesy
While we are staying with the saints, we have to open up all the things concerning God's New Testament economy, His eternal plan
As an illustration of what it means to admonish, let us consider a father speaking to his son about his need to study diligently
In verse 19 Paul said that he served the Lord with tears, and in verse 31 he said that he admonished each saint with tears
We know that Paul had contact with them before he wrote 1 Corinthians because he referred to a previous letter that he wrote them
How could Paul have charged them to prophesy if he had not taught them something about it and if they had no knowledge of it?
In Acts 2 the three thousand new disciples met from house to house, but in 5:42 'they' refers to the apostles mentioned in verses 40 and 41
In the past, we may have baptized some new ones, but not many of them remained because we left them as orphans
We should thank the Lord for so many who are willing to go out, praying for them and looking to the Lord for His blessing upon the church
As long as such an activity is for the gospel of the Lord, we should thank the Lord that He has burdened so many
We must be careful to go on positively in a gradual way, and we must have a clear view with a definite purpose
We must have a vision that these two crucial portions of the Word-1 Corinthians 14:26 and Ephesians 4:11-16-need to be fully recovered
Our senior co-worker, Brother Nee, stressed this matter twice beginning over fifty years ago, and we must pick up this burden
We have to believe that this is the time and that we are the right people for the Lord to use to recover these two portions of the Word
According to Ephesians 416 the saints in the Body of Christ are categorized into two groups every joint of the rich supply and each one part
Ordinarily we need the elders and coworkers to go to visit the saints homes to teach them personally and directly mouth to mouth year round
It is not acceptable to prepare a message to speak once a week, and then take it easy the rest of the week to have leisure time
If a branch of the vine tree is really and richly enjoying the life juice from the tree, surely the branch will bear fruit
The saints and churches who have practiced visiting people in their homes with the gospel have testified of the fruitfulness of this way
In order to build His church, He first accomplished His full redemption from His incarnation through His ascension
If we say that the first century was the age of the apostles, this implies strongly that after the first century, there are no more apostles
However, we have to see and admit that there have been these four categories of gifted persons throughout the history of the church
When the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in the early part of the nineteenth century, many great teachers were produced
In the early days of the Lord's recovery in China, Brother Watchman Nee was greatly influenced by Brethren teachings
He realized that we could not follow the Brethren in an absolute way because of their serious mistake in the practice of the church life
Because he was influenced by Darby's teaching regarding the apostles, however, he said that we dare not say that we are the apostles today
Since the gospel was preached in many pagan regions, churches were established, and elders were appointed, how could there not be apostles?
From that time he began to say that we were the official apostles and that the elders established by us were official elders
It is hard to find someone among us in the Lord's recovery who has really been perfected in the preaching of the gospel
If a real evangelist were to stay with us for even a short period of time, we would be burning for the preaching of the gospel
When you knock on a person's door and they ask who it is, how you answer will many times determine whether or not they let you in
The burden of the gifted persons is to perfect the saints, and the perfected saints do the direct building work
After being perfected, the saints, according to Ephesians 4:15, will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things
Suppose a brother comes to you, an elder, and says: 'First Corinthians 1:30 says that God has put us into Christ
If you give him a doctrinal answer concerning the twofoldness of the divine truth, you may lead him into the forest
If you were perfected, you might answer the brother like this: 'It is true that we are in Christ, brother, but what about our living?
We may have been generally edified in the past by listening to messages, but how much of the truth has been constituted into us?
In one of their big office buildings, there were many Americans in a big office space doing routine work eight hours a day
We would have practiced visiting people by knocking on their doors to find out about it and to break through in our increase
In order to go on, we all need to drop our old concepts and pick up the new view of the Lord's present recovery
We all have to admit that there are many ways to preach the gospel, but to visit people in their homes is the best way
The Lord told us in Luke 14:23, 'Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled'
Regardless of how little we think we know, we still must contact them as much as we can and minister to them as much as we know
Many of us may have to work for a living, but we still should have the evenings and weekends to give to the Lord
, but nearly every day the first thing he did when he came home from work was to go and visit people for the Lord
If we take this way, we will enjoy the Lord's presence, and we, our family, and our church will be greatly blessed
They need to realize that they have a regenerated spirit which they can exercise by calling on the name of the Lord and praying
Every time we go to visit them, we can check with them, 'Do you have something to say for the Lord or of the Lord'?
We can encourage them to first tell how they were saved and then encourage them to speak concerning how they experienced the Lord
We need to go on from the home meetings to bring them into contact with other saints in their neighborhood for a small group meeting
It is helpful to use either the Life Lessons or Truth Lessons because all the necessary verses and material are there
Perhaps the ones who go out to preach the gospel could transfer the care of their new ones to the ones who are burdened for home meetings
If we only beget them and do not visit them again and again to nourish them and cherish them, how can we expect to keep them?
As we practice the new way, we should not criticize other places that are not practicing the same way that we are
Every place will be practicing the new way to one degree or another depending on the situation in that locality
An elder should not have the attitude that the saints need to get permission from him to go out and knock on doors
The elders may have the heart to keep the church in a good order, but they should not restrict the saints in this way
If we are faithful to the Lord, the time will come when the Lord will gain twenty thousand out of a city of one hundred fifty thousand
Some may go out to knock on doors, some may go out to take care of home meetings, and others may be taking care of small group meetings
How could so many be under the mere control of the elders, that is, without the positive activities according to the Lord's leading?
The only way that things could be under the elders' mere control is for the church to remain with a small number
