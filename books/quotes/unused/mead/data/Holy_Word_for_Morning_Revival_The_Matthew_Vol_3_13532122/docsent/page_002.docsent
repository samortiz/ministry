   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>53 And when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>54 And He came into His own country and taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said, Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>55 Is not this the 1 carpenter's son?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>57 And they were stumbled because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>58 And He did not do many works of power there because of their unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>55 1 In 12:24 the Pharisees opposed and rejected Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here the Galileans knew Him according to the flesh, not according to the spirit 2 Cor 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They were blinded by their natural knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After we have seen the unveiling of the Lord Himself and the unveiling of the mystery of the kingdom of God, we as His followers need to know the way to follow Him .How we thank Matthew for including in his doctrinal book not only a diagram of the kingdom, but also a map of the pathway so that we may enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the end of chapter thirteen to the middle of chapter seventeen we have a clear map showing us how to walk on the pathway as we follow our beloved King into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first thing we face on this pathway is rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because Christ is the rejected One, we must be rejected also.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not expect to be welcomed, for no one will welcome you until the glory comes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, you must be willing to be rejected .Many of us have experienced some measure of rejection by those who opposed our coming into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But I need to tell you that this rejection will not decrease; rather, it will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There will be rejection upon rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Be prepared for this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The heavenly King was rejected first by the Jewish religionists.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The religious leaders rejected Christ to the uttermost because they were fully occupied, possessed, and veiled by their religion .After the Lord had been rejected in Jerusalem, the religious center, He turned to a geographical area that was not so religious Galilee, the place where He was born and raised .However, He was not even welcomed in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although the Galileans did not oppose Him, they rejected Him because of their natural knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would know Christ and follow Him, we need to realize that religion and natural knowledge are both veils .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are two great obstacles frustrating people from recognizing who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to natural knowledge, Christ was the son of a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His countrymen knew all of His outward features, but they did not see that God was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we follow the Lord in His recovery, we should not know people according to the flesh or estimate them according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should know them according to one thing according to the measure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Knowledge, intelligence, and outward appearance mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps a certain brother cannot speak well and uses poor grammar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet whenever he opens his mouth, Christ comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even when you are sitting in his presence, you realize that some amount of Christ is with him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the church life in the Lord's recovery we do not care for the outward appearance; we care only for the spirit within, where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the way to know Christ, the way to know other Christians, and the way to follow the Lord.</S>
