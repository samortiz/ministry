   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT QUENCHING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the context of the verse which says that we need to pray unceasingly, we should not quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means we should live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not to pray unceasingly for your business affairs, for good food, for good blessings, for this, or for that.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To pray unceasingly is to pray that the Spirit within you would never be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This simply means that Christ lives within you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You need to pray that the Christ in you would live and you would live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this we need to pray all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our breathing never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Twenty-four hours a day we breathe in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We don t change the subject in our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may change our diet many times, but we never change our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even while I m speaking, I m breathing unceasingly in order to stay alive.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have to pray this kind of breathing prayer unceasingly in order to keep you living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>FOUND IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is an encouraging word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The only way to deal with your peculiarity is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you live Christ, you don t live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then your peculiarity is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as you live yourself, peculiarity is there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you live Christ, you don t live yourself; spontaneously peculiarity is terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether you are straight, peculiar, common, or general, don t deal with your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as you don t live Christ, your peculiarity is there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Forget about the peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just practice one thing to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul said, To me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you get into the spirit of Paul in his writings, especially in Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, and Galatians you can see he surely practiced to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He made this his habit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before he got saved, he practiced to live the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wherever he was, he was found in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But after he was saved, he aspired to be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How could he be found in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no other way but just to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When he lives Christ, surely he is found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may be good Christians, yet when people find us, they don t find us in Christ; rather, they find us in culture, in politics, in education, in dollars, in business, or in other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They may find us in many things, but not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if we do live Christ moment by moment from morning to evening, wherever people find us and whenever people find us, they will find us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By Paul s words you can see that he was serious and desperate, so he, no doubt, practiced this habit a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From this point in the Perfecting Training I would give you one charge, that is, we all have to receive this word to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Go practice this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every day, every hour, every minute, even every second, in whatever you are doing, you must practice the living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This must be by the unceasing prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the time you have to pray, Lord, live through me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lord, live through me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At work, in your kitchen, doing your laundry, pray, Lord, live through me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all need to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When children are learning to play the piano, they need the proper daily practice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They don t need that many lessons, but they need much practice.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To become a good pianist requires one to practice many hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some top pianists may practice as many as fifteen hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If they were to miss three days of practice, an expert could tell from their playing that they had missed the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to practice not fifteen hours a day but twenty-four hours a day to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What we re speaking in this Perfecting Training is like a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The crucial thing is that you need to go home and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul says, To me to live is Christ...that I may know Him...that I may gain Him... that I may be found in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is his aspiration for his practice of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For many years I tried this way or that way in order to go on, but now I can tell you that the crucial thing is for you to practice living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Take this lesson and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let us take the next half hour for you to ask questions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Question: When did Brother Paul first learn the lesson on living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I don t know, but anyhow, he learned the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In a sense you don t need to find out these things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He practiced it, so you can practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To ask this question means you re like a theological student, studying time, geography, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Don t ask these theoretical questions.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Ask some practical questions.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Question: Brother Lee, I believe that when you say we need to practice living Christ, it is the same as saying to practice exercising your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The problem is, although we have known this for several years, and we know we should exercise our spirit, we don t.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What can cause us to want to exercise our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Truthfully, you have to pray, Lord, send me twelve angels to remind me minute after minute that I have to exercise my spirit, that I have to live Christ, that I have to practice Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>My experience in this is exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I knew that I should live Christ, and I knew that I should exercise my spirit, but every day I didn t practice it adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But after many days of practice, my habit is better.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This does not mean that I m so successful.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even when Paul wrote Philippians, he said that he had not obtained, that he was still pressing on.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The matter of living Christ is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although the Apostle Paul never told us that he was not successful, his writings indicate that he was not absolutely mature in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Nearly every morning I have prayed, Lord, remind me all the day that I have to live You.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>One of the psalmists asked the Lord to set a watch to keep his mouth Psa 141:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This means we need a reminder from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is so easy for us to forget this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must be desperate to build this kind of habit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We need much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Lord, live through me.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Question: It seems as though sometimes when you try to live Christ, you don t and at other times spontaneously you just live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I don t understand that experience.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Yesterday I was trying to speak to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I really wanted to flow something of life out to her, but I was so dead.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I was trying to exercise and to get myself into the spirit, but nothing came out.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But today when I saw the same person, without even trying something spontaneously rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Was that from my prayer of yesterday?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>According to my limited experience I would say this: If we try to live Christ beyond or apart from praying we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If you try to live Christ without praying you will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Don t try to live Christ, but pray.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is only by a continual living prayer, a breathing prayer, that we spontaneously will live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we make up our minds to try to live Christ, that is actually the living of our self.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is why Paul charges us to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>To pray unceasingly simply means to stop our own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If you don t pray, yet you try to do something, that is your own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This point is like a small screw in a large machine.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When a large machine works, it depends upon some small screws.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Not to try to live Christ, but to pray is a small thing, yet it is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Don t make up your mind to try to live Christ, but all the day long pray, Lord, live through me.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Don t have an intention to live Christ before someone.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Simply have an aspiration to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This needs prayer all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Question: The kind of work I do requires a lot of concentration.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>A lot of times I get into the Word, but I find that I m out of my spirit and not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>What do we do when we discover that we re working or studying and we find ourselves out of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>How do we keep this kind of living prayer going on while we re concentrating on our work?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Again we need the practice to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Regardless of how busy we may be and how heavy a burden is upon us, we must practice to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>While you are under the burden of the work, you have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Of course this is not habitual to us; this is why we need to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Regardless of how busy you are, you don t stop breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>So we must practice this kind of prayer regardless of how much work we have.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Even while I am speaking I must keep a kind of contact and prayer with the Lord a kind of praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Learn to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>This is very, very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The real holiness, the real victory, the real spirituality is here.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Even the real church life is here.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>When we practice this way we will live Christ, and then we will have the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>So no matter what kind of situation we are in, we have to practice this kind of breathing prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Question: How much is the matter of growth in life related to the living of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>You said that transformation is just to make us flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Is that only a kind of outward working upon us, or is there still the aspect of being saturated and permeated with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>This aspect of transformation seems a little different from what you have shared with us in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>When we practice living Christ, no doubt we give the Lord much ground and much opportunity to change our being.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>You have to realize our natural being is so raw and so wild.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Our natural being just doesn t fit the living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>As a new learner, it is hard because your being is raw and wild.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Even when you pray, your being is wild and raw.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>But if you would practice and continue to practice, the Lord will gradually do something to transform your natural, raw, and wild being.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Then your being would become so fitting in the living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>This is the proper definition of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We may have thought that transformation was just to change our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Although this is correct, the purpose is also for us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Transformation is not just to change us, but to adjust us to fit in to the living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>The key is to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>If you practice the living of Christ, all these things will transpire in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Gradually things will be happening to you if you practice Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Question: Brother Lee, would you share more to guide us so that our practice may not turn into a form of self-improvement or a kind of behavior?</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Otherwise we may decide to pray without ceasing and set our energy to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Then we will get into the cycle of trying and failing and being condemned and giving up.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>I find there is such a capacity in our being to distort what we hear and to turn it into a kind of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Is there anything you could share with us that would help us to take the word in a simple and pure way?</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Otherwise, we may try to behave as if we re living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>You don t need to make up your mind, and you don t need to make a strong decision.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>You don t need to think to try to improve yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Forget about all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>You only need one thing to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Learn to pray all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Learn to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>To make up your mind in this matter doesn t work so well.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>To make a decision always becomes a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>If you try to behave yourself, you may make it for three weeks, but eventually you will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Forget about these things and simply practice one thing, that is, to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>Practice to pray all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>LOVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>The basic foundation for us to pray is that we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>We just love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>Therefore, we seek Him, and we like to contact Him, and we like to pray to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>We like to call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>The basic stone is the loving of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>I just love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>Here you can remember the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>In the Song of Songs the seeker became so desperate that she only knew one person, and she was only seeking after that one person.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>The Song of Songs shows us this.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>Even the Song of Songs is full of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>All the time the seeker was praying to her beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>There was a kind of praying atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>The most helpful thing to us is to pray the unceasing and breathing prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>But we must have a foundation of loving the Lord.</S>
