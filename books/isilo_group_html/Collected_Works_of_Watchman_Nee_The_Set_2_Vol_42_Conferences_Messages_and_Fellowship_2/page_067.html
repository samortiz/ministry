Leviticus 17:11 says, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make propitiation for your souls; for it is the blood which, by the life, makes propitiation." The Old Testament mentions the blood over three hundred times, but Leviticus 17:11 is the only place where the function of the blood is explained. This is the only place in the Old Testament that tells us that the blood is for propitiation.</p><h2 class="head2">In the Four Gospels</h2><p>We also need to see what the four Gospels say about the blood. There are not many instances in the four Gospels where the blood is mentioned. In Matthew 26:28, the Lord spoke to the disciples before His betrayal, saying, "This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." This shows us the function of the blood. The blood is for the forgiveness of sins. On the night before the Lord's death, He explained the function of the blood, which is for the forgiveness of sins. Contrary to the assertion of the modernists, who say that the blood was merely an indication of sacrifice, the blood of Christ was shed for man's redemption.</p><h2 class="head2">The Apostle Paul</h2><p>Let us consider the apostle's concept of the blood. In Romans 3:25 the apostle Paul said, "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred." The word "propitiation" is the same as the word denoting mercy seat in Greek; it is the flat covering on top of the ark. It is also called the throne of grace. Within the ark was the law, which condemned man and judged his sins. But the covering, that is, the throne of grace, was on top of the ark. This means that all sins are under the throne of grace, and God does not see them anymore. Paul told us that this propitiation cover is just the Lord Jesus, and that it is enacted by God through the blood of Jesus.</p><p>A Seventh-day Adventist believer once hung the Ten Commandments on the wall, with the fourth commandment cut out as a reminder that breaking the Sabbath is breaking the fourth commandment. Actually even when a person keeps the Sabbath, he sins against all ten commandments as soon as he breaks any of the other commandments.</p><p>Thank God that the Lord Jesus has become our propitiation cover. He is sitting on top of the law. The law cannot condemn us any longer. The only way we can be condemned by the law is if we put aside the Lord Jesus (Rom. 8:33-34).</p><p>Ephesians 1:7, 2:13, and Hebrews 9:12-14 and 22 say that Christ shed His blood to redeem us from sin. The blood is for the washing away of sins; it is not to wash our hearts. Man's heart is too evil, and the blood cannot wash it. Man's heart is deceitful above all things (Jer. 17:9) and all wicked things proceed from within the heart (Mark 7:23). The blood does not change a wicked heart into a good heart; the blood only washes away our sins and cleanses us of them. There is no verse in the Bible that tells us that the Lord's blood washes our heart. Some may say that in the Chinese Union Version Hebrews 10:22 says that the blood washes our heart. But actually this verse only says that the blood cleanses our conscience. Our conscience is related to sin. When a man sins, his conscience is no longer at peace. Once a man sins, he dares not come to God. There is a barrier between him and God. He dares not face God and is afraid to see Him. But the blood of Jesus has been shed. God cannot be unrighteous; He has to wash away our sins. We have incurred a debt of sin, and the blood has paid our debt for us. The Lord Jesus has shed His blood for us, and God has to acknowledge this. Since Christ has borne our sins for us, God can no longer claim any payment from us. A debt can only claim payment once; it cannot claim payment twice. Once we have such a faith, our conscience will be at peace.</p><p>Some have asked if a person is saved through God's righteousness or through His grace. We are saved through His righteousness. From the time the Son of God was born to the time He was crucified, we see grace. But from the time He was lifted up on the cross, we see God's righteousness. Because the Lord has died, God has to forgive us. It was perfectly all right for God not to send His Son to die for us; this would merely have meant that God was not being gracious to us. But now that He has sent His Son to die for us, He has to forgive us because He cannot be unrighteous. Being unrighteous means to sin, and God cannot sin; therefore, He cannot be unrighteous. Since the Lord Jesus has shed His blood, God has to forgive all who believe in Him.</p><h2 class="head2">The Apostle Peter</h2><p>In 1 Peter 1:18-19, the apostle Peter said, "Knowing that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were redeemed from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers, but with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ." The Bible never says that sin is dealt with by the cross. The cross only deals with the old man. The Bible tells us that sin is dealt with by the precious blood of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Apostle John</h2><p>In 1 John 1:7-9 the apostle John said that the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanses us from every sin. Our hearts are thoroughly wicked; even God cannot cleanse them. He can only cleanse us from our sins. In Swatow during our conference, a middle-age sister came to me one morning at six o'clock and insisted that she had to see me. The sister was not a decent person. She was a widow and unbridled in her conduct. She was somewhat rich and had committed some uncommon sins. She came to me and said, "I have committed many sins, and my conscience is not at peace. I do not know if God will forgive me." I quoted 1 John 1:9 and told her that all sins can be forgiven. Whether she considered a sin to be pardonable or unpardonable, refined or crude, moral or immoral, as long as it was a sin, it was included in "our sins." Even if she could not give a name to a sin, it was included in "our sins" as well.</p><p>She answered, "But I am too evil. I am afraid that God cannot forgive me." I then spoke to her in an angry tone (of course, without any malice in my heart), "Do you know who you are doubting? You are doubting the faithful God. You are doubting the loving God. You are doubting the God who cannot lie. Do you know what a sin you have committed? All the sins that you have committed all your life could not add up to the sin that you have just committed. Doubting God and questioning His Word are the greatest sins that man can ever commit." She immediately turned from weeping into joy and said, "Then I know that God has indeed forgiven me." When I saw her exhilaration, I knew for the first time what it felt like for a person to turn from weeping to joy. The next morning she came again and said, "My sins are indeed forgiven. But there are many scars because of my sins. What should I do about these scars?" I said, "Read the second part of 1 John 1:9. It says that `He is faithful and righteous to...cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' The blood of Jesus His Son can cleanse us of our sins to the extent that we feel as if we have never sinned. Since God has forgotten your sins, you should not remember your sins either. You should forget about your own sins, the sins of the brothers and sisters, and the sins of everyone else. Otherwise, you will be saying that you have a better memory than God."</p><p>In the last part of Revelation 1:5 John said, "Who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood." God washes away our sins and releases us from our sins by His own blood. Both the Old Testament and the New Testament show us that the blood deals with sins; it redeems us from sins and washes away our sins. The blood of Christ has been shed for us. God is righteous, and He must forgive those who come to Him through the blood of His Son. If anyone does not believe in this word, he is making God a liar (1 John 5:9-10). The greatest sin is to make God a liar. We should not doubt God's Word. When God says that our sins are forgiven and that we have been sprinkled from an evil conscience, we should come to Him with a true heart in full assurance of faith.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
