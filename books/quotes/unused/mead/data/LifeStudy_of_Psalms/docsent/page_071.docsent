   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The law as the testimony of God Psa 78:5 was given by God to be the side line alongside the main line to guard the chosen people of God until Christ as the end of the law Rom 10:4a came Gal 3:23-25 .</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE SPIRIT OF THE BIBLE</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These five verses are unique in the Bible in exalting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ must have the first place; He must have the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ has the preeminence in the Godhead because in the Godhead, He is the image of God, the embodiment of God, and the expression of God.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is the preeminent One.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is first in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since He has the first place in all things, we must give Him the first place in our being and in all that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He must be first in our marriage, in our spending of money, and in our demeanor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the way that we dress, we must give Christ the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The spirit of the Bible is just to exalt Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we come to study the Psalms, we must realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must realize that we cannot exalt anything higher than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we exalt anyone or anything other than Christ, we break the spirit of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are going to interpret any types or explain any parables, we must take care of this spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Also the spirit of the Bible does not give any orthodox position to the law Gal 4:21-25 given by God alongside His economy Rom 5:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many teachings in Christianity today are off the mark because they do not take care of the lines, the principles, and the spirit of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to stay on the line of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether or not we speak with the oracle of God depends upon what we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A prophet is one who has received the word from God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then he speaks the word in the line of the tree of life, in the proper principles, and in the spirit of exalting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In whatever we speak, we must have a spirit to exalt Christ.</S>
