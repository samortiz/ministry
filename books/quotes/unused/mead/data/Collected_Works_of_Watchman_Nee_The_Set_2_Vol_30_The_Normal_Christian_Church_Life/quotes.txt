[2]  The contents of Volume 30 of The Collected Works, with the exception of some minor adjustments to British punctuation, expressions, idioms, and spellings, have been taken directly from the edition published by Watchman Nee in England in 1939 under the title Concerning Our Missions.
[3]  After the publication of my book in Chinese, quite a number of missionaries asked for an English edition.
[4]  I felt reluctant to comply, for personally I should prefer to have those books translated which better represent my ministry, rather than this one which is liable to be misunderstood and controverted.
[5]  The content of the following pages is the substance of a number of talks to my younger fellow workers during conferences held recently in Shanghai and Hankow.
[6]  When the addresses were given, the present book was not in view, but only my immediate audience; and the fact that the messages were intended for the instruction of my young colleagues accounts for their intensely practical nature, and for the simplicity of the style adopted.
[7]  At these two conferences we sought in the first place to examine the teaching of God's Word concerning His churches and His work, and in the second place to review our past missions in the light of our findings.1
[8]  The truths referred to in this book have been gradually learned and practiced during the past years.
[9]  Numerous adjustments have been made as greater light has been received, and if we remain humble, and God still shows us mercy, we believe there will be further adjustments in the future.
[10]  The Lord has graciously given us a number of associates in the work, all of whom have been sent forth on the basis mentioned in this book, and through their labors numerous churches have been established in different parts of China.
[11]  Though conditions are vastly different in these many churches, and the believers connected with them differ greatly too in background, education, social standing, and spiritual experience yet we have found that if, under the absolute lordship of Jesus, we come to see the heavenly pattern of church formation and government, then the scriptural methods are both practicable and fruitful.
[12]  God said to the Israelites, "Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives" Matt 19:8 , but the Lord Jesus said, "What God has yoked together, let man not separate" Matt 19:6 .
[13]  The Lord as an apostle was unique, and the twelve, as apostles, were also unique; but neither the Apostle nor the twelve apostles could abide on earth forever.
[14]  Since the meaning of the word "apostle" is "the sent one," the meaning of apostleship is quite plain, that is, the office of the sent one.
[15]  Many called of God are not as gifted as Paul, but if they have received a commission from God, they are just as truly apostles as he was.
[16]  Teachers are men who have received the gift of teaching.
[17]  This is not a miraculous gift, but a gift of grace, which accounts for the fact of its being omitted from the list of miraculous gifts in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10, and included in the list of the gifts of grace in Romans 12.
[18]  It is a gift of grace which enables its possessors to understand the teachings of God's Word, and to discern His purposes, and thus equips them to instruct His people in doctrinal matters.
[19]  "Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
[20]  And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them" Acts 13:1-2 .
[21]  The sphere of an apostle's work is quite different from that of the other three special ministers.
[22]  You can find prophets and teachers in the local church, but not apostles, because they have been called to minister in different places, while the ministry of prophets and teachers is confined to one locality 1 Cor 14:26, 29 .
[23]  The church in Antioch is the model church shown us in God's Word, because it was the first to come into being after the founding of the churches connected with the Jews and the Gentiles.
[24]  In Acts 2 we see the church in connection with the Jews established in Jerusalem, and in chapter ten we see the church in connection with the Gentiles established in the house of Cornelius.
[25]  Yes, it was the Holy Spirit who called Barnabas and Saul, but He said to the other prophets and teachers as well as to them, "Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
[26]  On what ground did these prophets and teachers set certain men apart as apostles, and whom did these prophets and teachers represent?
[27]  Why did they, and not the entire church, separate those workers?
[28]  First Corinthians 12 deals with the subject of the Body of Christ, not in its life aspect but in its work aspect.
[29]  The whole chapter is taken up with the question of ministry, and that ministry is spoken of as the functioning of the different members, from which it is evident that in the thought of God all ministry is on Body ground.
[30]  Therefore, we see that when the life aspect of the Body of Christ is expressed, there you have a local church; and when the work aspect is expressed, there you have a manifestation of the gifts God has given to His Church.
[31]  After the apostles were called by the Spirit and were separated for the work by the representative members of the Body, what did they do?
[32]  But the question arises, How were these new converts shepherded and instructed?
[33]  What they did was simply this: "When they had appointed elders for them in every church and had prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord into whom they had believed" v. 23 . Wherever a church had been founded on their outward journey, they appointed elders on their return journey.
[34]  In God's plan provision has been made for the building up of local churches, and in that plan pastors have a place, but it was never His thought that apostles should assume the role of pastors.
[35]  He purposed that apostles should be responsible for the work in different places, while elders were to bear responsibility in one place.
[36]  It is not necessary that elders resign their ordinary professions and devote themselves exclusively to their duties in connection with the church.
[37]  Elders were local men appointed to oversee affairs in the local church.
[38]  The Word of God nowhere speaks of apostles managing the affairs of a local church, and it nowhere speaks of elders managing the affairs of several local churches.
[39]  It is the responsibility of every saved man to serve the Lord according to his capacity and in his own sphere.
[40]  God did not appoint elders to do the work on behalf of their brethren.
[41]  Peter confessed that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, and our Lord declared that He would build His Church upon this confession the confession that as to His Person He is the Son of God, and as to His work He is the Christ of God.
[42]  The Church mentioned in chapter sixteen includes all the children of God in every locality, while the church mentioned in chapter eighteen includes only the children of God living in one locality; and it is because it is limited to one place that it is possible for you to tell your difficulties to the believers of whom it is composed.
[43]  Throughout the Word of God we can find no name attached to a church save the name of a place, for example, the church in Jerusalem, the church in Lystra, the church in Derbe, the church in Colosse, the church in Troas, the church in Thessalonica, the church in Antioch.
[44]  We have seen that all the churches in Scripture are local churches, but the question naturally arises, What is a scriptural locality?
[45]  If we note what places are mentioned in God's Word in connection with the founding of churches, then we shall be able to determine what the extent of a place must be to justify its being regarded as a unit for the forming of a church.
[46]  We read in 1 Corinthians 1:2 of "the church of God which is in Corinth."
[47]  When discord crept in and its members were on the point of splitting the church into four different factions, Paul wrote, rebuking them: "Each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ....Are you not men of flesh?"
[48]  It was never God's purpose that a number of churches in different places should be combined under any denomination or organization, but rather that each one should be independent of the other.
[49]  When our Lord sent messages to His children in Asia, He did not address them as "the church in Asia," but "the seven churches which are in Asia."
[50]  In the introduction of His letters to the seven churches we find our Lord addressing the angel of each church, but at their close we find that His message to one particular church was also a message to all the churches.
[51]  Since there is a spiritual relatedness between the various local churches, no one church may strike out on an individualistic line, and taking advantage of its independence, decide things after its own good pleasure.
[52]  Each must rather cultivate a relationship with the other churches, seeking their sympathy and working with their spiritual good in view.
[53]  Since the churches of God are local, we must be careful to preserve their local character, their local sphere, and their local boundary.
[54]  Once a church loses these, it ceases to be a scriptural church.
[55]  CHAPTER FIVE THE BASIS OF UNION AND DIVISION THE FORMING OF LOCAL CHURCHES
[56]  In the previous chapter we observed that the word "church" was only mentioned twice in the Gospels.
[57]  It is used frequently in the Acts, but we are never explicitly told there how a church was formed.
[58]  The second chapter speaks of the salvation of about three thousand men, and the fourth chapter of a further five thousand, but nothing whatever is said about these believers forming a church.
[59]  Here the Scriptures call the children of God "the church," without even mentioning how the church came into being.
[60]  The Church of God includes a vast number of believers, living at different times, and scattered in different places throughout the earth.
[61]  "One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all" Eph 4:4-6 .
[62]  A person is constituted a member of the Church on the ground that he possesses the oneness of the Spirit, and that will result in his being one with all believers on the above seven points.
[63]  In drawing a line of demarcation between those who belong to the Church and those who do not, we must require nothing beyond these seven lest we exclude any who belong to the family of God; and we dare not require anything less, lest we include any who do not belong to the divine family.
[64]  Now what is true of the universal Church is also true of a local church.
[65]  The local church comprises all those who, in a given locality, have the oneness of the Spirit.
[66]  Anyone wishing to belong to a church in a given locality must answer two requirements he must be a child of God, and he must live in that particular locality.
[67]  Here Paul points out the carnality of the Corinthian believers in attempting to divide the church of God in Corinth, which, by the divine ordering, was indivisible, being already the smallest scriptural unit upon which any church could be established.
[68]  Cephas was a zealous minister of the gospel, Paul was a man who had suffered much for his Lord's sake, and Apollos was one whom God certainly used in His service, but though all three had been indisputably owned of God in Corinth, God could never permit the church there to make them a ground of division.
[69]  It was all right to have a church in Corinth and a church in Ephesus, and quite all right to have several churches in Galatia and a number in Macedonia, for difference of locality justified division into these various churches.
[70]  In the Greek the word rendered "heresies" in Galatians 5:20 KJV does not necessarily convey the thought of error, but rather of division on the ground of doctrine.
[71]  Though some may be right and others wrong, God does not sanction any division on account of difference as to such beliefs.1 If a group of believers split off from a local church in their zeal for certain teaching according to the Word of God, the new "church" they establish may have more scriptural teaching, but it could never be a scriptural church.
[72]  Should we arrive at a place where a church has already been established on clear local ground, and discover that its members hold views which we consider unscriptural, or that they consider the views we hold as unscriptural, if we then refuse to recognize them as the church of God in that locality and withdraw from fellowship, we are divisive.
[73]  "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit" 1 Cor 12:13 .
[74]  The question naturally arises, if the spiritual life of a local not denominational church is very low, can a few of the more spiritual members not gather together and form another assembly?
[75]  CHAPTER SIX THE WORK AND THE CHURCHES THE APOSTLES AND THE CHURCHES
[76]  In regard to the universal Church, God first brought it into being, and thereafter set apostles to minister to it 1 Cor 12:28 ; but in regard to the local churches the order was quite otherwise.
[77]  Just as the apostles have spiritual but no official responsibility regarding the church, so the elders, and the whole church, have spiritual but no official responsibility regarding the work.
[78]  It is commendable if a local church seeks to help in the work; but it is under no official obligation to do so.
[79]  If the members of the church are spiritual, they cannot but regard the work of God as their work, in which case they will count it a joy to help in any way.
[80]  The church in Rome is a good illustration of the foregoing.
[81]  Before Paul visited Rome, he had written to the church there expressing an intense desire to see them Rom 1:10-11 .
[82]  When he actually reached Rome, the church there did not hand over local responsibility to him, nor did they say as a church today probably would , "Now that an apostle has come into our midst, he must take over the responsibility and be our pastor."
[83]  Every apostle must learn to live in "his own rented dwelling" and work with that as his center, leaving the responsibility of the local church to the local brethren.1 The work of God belongs to the workers, but the church of God belongs to the locality.
[84]  When a servant of God reaches a new place, his first business must be to found a local church, unless there is one already in existence, in which case his one concern must be to help the church.
[85]  Of course, if the church is spiritual, its members will recognize their spiritual responsibility, and will be willing to assist in material ways so that the work of God may go forward, but the worker should take nothing for granted and should bear the entire financial burden, so that it may be manifest that the church and the work are absolutely distinct.
[86]  Time and again God has raised up some new witness, or group of witnesses, giving them fresh light from His Word, so that they could bear a special testimony for Him in the particular time and circumstances in which they live.
[87]  It must not be inferred from the foregoing that God has no other workmen but apostles and the various ministers of the Word.
[88]  Those who work in the ministry of the Word are only a section of God's servants.
[89]  Before considering the question of spiritual authority, let us read a few passages of Scripture bearing on the relationship between the workers, as they throw considerable light on our subject.
[90]  All positions held by God's ministers are spiritual, not official.
[91]  Alas! men have only seen half the truth, so they try to organize the work and appoint a director to superintend the service of others, but their directing is based upon their position in the organization, not upon their position in the ministry.
[92]  The reason Paul could direct others was that the ministry committed to him by the Lord put him in a position of authority over them; and the reason Titus, Timothy, and Tychicus could submit to being directed was that the ministry committed to them by the Lord put them in a position under his authority.
[93]  In Scripture the workers were formed into companies, but that does not imply that all the apostles formed themselves into one company and placed everything under one central control.
[94]  It is quite in order for scores of men, or even hundreds, who have received the same trust from God, to join together in the same work; but in the Scriptures we find no centralization of authority for the control of all the apostles.
[95]  The question naturally arises, how should workers and working associations cooperate?
[96]  To one company God gives one kind of ministry, and to another an altogether different form of ministry.
[97]  If a worker goes to a place where there is no church and founds one there for the propagation of his particular doctrine, then we cannot cooperate with him because he is building up a sect, and not a church.
[98]  On the other hand, should a worker go to a place where there is already a local church, and instead of contributing his teaching and experience to its upbuilding, seek to make it a branch-church of the society to which he belongs, then again it is impossible for us to cooperate, because he is building up a denomination.
[99]  It is a remarkable fact that, while the book of Acts supplies many minute details regarding the work of an apostle, the one subject which from a human standpoint is of paramount importance in the carrying on of any work is not dealt with at all.
[100]  Our Lord said, "The worker is worthy of his wages" Luke 10:7 ; and Paul wrote to the Corinthians, "So also the Lord directed those who announce the gospel to live from the gospel" 1 Cor 9:14 .
[101]  It does not mean that God's servant should receive a definite allowance from the church, for the modern system of paid service in the work of God was unknown in Paul's day.
[102]  It is not permissible to receive a definite salary from a church, and at times it is not even permissible to receive an indefinite gift.
[103]  Paul was demonstrating this principle in not receiving anything from the Corinthian church.
[104]  If anyone gives us a gift out of pity for us, then for the Lord's sake we dare not accept it; or if gifts are offered, the reception of which would either bring us under obligation to the givers, or bring us under their control, we must refuse them too.
[105]  All the servants of God must not only trust Him entirely for the supply of their needs, but when gifts are freely offered them, they must be able to discern clearly whether or not such gifts could be received by God.
[106]  We are the representatives of God in this world, and we are here to prove His faithfulness; therefore, above all in financial matters we must be totally independent of men, and wholly dependent upon God.
[107]  Our attitude, our words, and our actions must all declare that He alone is our source of supply.
[108]  Let us be clear that we must not only bear the burden of our own personal needs, but of the needs of the work as well.
[109]  If God has called us to a certain work, then all financial outlay connected with it is our affair.
[110]  In the Old Testament we read that though the Levites stood in the place of God to receive tithes from all His people, they themselves offered tithes to Him.
[111]  We praise God for the generous way the workers in days past have given to their fellow laborers, but we still need to be more thoughtful for the material needs of all our brethren in the work.
[112]  Having already observed the difference between the work and the churches, between the apostles and the elders, between the basis of a scriptural church and sects, we can now proceed to see how a local church is organized.
[113]  According to the present-day conception, three things are regarded as essential to the existence of a church, apart from the group of Christians who constitute its members.
[114]  But in God's Word it is the living believers who are called the church, not the bricks and mortar see Acts 5:11; Matt 18:17 .
[115]  Before we consider the question of meeting, let us first say a few words concerning the nature of the Church.
[116]  Christ is the Head of the Church and "we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another" Rom 12:5 .
[117]  There is only one verse in the New Testament which speaks of the importance of Christians meeting together; it is Hebrews 10:25: "Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near."
[118]  This verse shows that the object of such assembling is to exhort "one another."
[119]  This is obviously not an apostolic meeting, for it is not a case of one man exhorting the entire assembly, but all the members bearing equal responsibility to exhort one another.
[120]  Meetings where activity is one-sided do not come within the scope of the church, for they lack the distinctive feature of all church gatherings; and where any attempt is made to fit them into the church program, much trouble is sure to result.
[121]  The apostolic meeting is not an intrinsic part of the church life; it is merely a piece of work, and it ceases with the departure of the worker.
[122]  But the church meetings go on uninterrupted, whether the worker is present or absent.
[123]  It is because the difference has not been realized between meetings for the church and for the work, that it has ever occurred to the brethren to cease to assemble themselves when the worker goes.
[124]  One of the fruitful sources of spiritual failure today is that the children of God consider the church to be a part of the work; so when there is a sermon to hear, they constitute a willing audience, but if there is no preacher, the meetings automatically cease, and there is no thought of simply gathering together to help one another.
[125]  We must differentiate between the work of the elders, and the work of the prophets and teachers.
[126]  Their work is different, but they are not necessarily different persons.
[127]  The elders are those who hold office in a local church; the prophets and teachers are the gifted ministers in a local church.
[128]  The elders are for church government at all times; the prophets and teachers are for ministry in church meetings.
[129]  In the earlier chapters of this book we have already seen what the ministry, the work, and the local churches are.
[130]  In this chapter we have seen the connection between the ministry and the local church, and also the difference between the church and the work.
[131]  Now we can consider more minutely the relationship between the ministry, the work, and the churches, in order to see clearly how they stand, how they function, what their respective spheres are, and how they are interrelated.
[132]  In Acts 13 we saw that God had established one of His churches in a certain locality; then He gave gifts to a few individuals in that church to equip them to minister there as prophets and teachers, so that the church might be built up.
