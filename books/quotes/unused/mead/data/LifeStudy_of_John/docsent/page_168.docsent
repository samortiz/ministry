   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Not One of His Bones Being Broken</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every aspect of the Lord s death was according to God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Under God s sovereignty, not one of the Lord s bones was broken 19:31-33, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Jews, not wanting the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath, asked Pilate that their legs might be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The soldiers then broke the legs of the two thieves who had been crucified with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when they came to Jesus, they saw that He had already died.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the Lord had already died, it was needless for them to break His bones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that, in a sense, the Lord Jesus was not put to death by human hands but that He died Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although He was crucified, He died Himself, fulfilling His word spoken in 10:17 and 18, where He said, I lay down My life that I may take it again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Apparently, Jesus was killed; actually, He laid down His psuche life, His soulish life, and died.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While the two criminals were killed, Jesus was not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, He laid down His psuche life for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since He had already died, the soldiers did not break His legs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This sovereignly fulfilled the prophecy which said, Not a bone of Him shall be broken 19:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One of the soldiers, being concerned that the Lord might not actually be dead, pierced His side with a spear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This fulfilled the prophecy in Zechariah 12:10: They shall look on him whom they pierced.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was absolutely of God s sovereignty that these things happened in such a meaningful and wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This proves strongly that the Lord s death was not accidental, but that it was planned by God before the foundation of the world 1 Pet 1:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord s having none of His bones broken was typified by the bones of the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the institution of the Passover, God ordained that none of the lamb s bones should be broken Exo 12:46; Num 9:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was a wonderful type.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, in Psalm 34:20 this was also prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both the type and the prophecy were fulfilled in the Lord s death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Genesis 2:21-23, we find the Scripture s first mention of bone, which was a rib taken out of Adam for producing and building Eve as a match for Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eve was a type of the church produced with the Lord s resurrection life that was released out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, the church came out of the resurrection life, the unbroken life, the incorruptible life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His is the life which can never be hurt, damaged, or broken.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If one of the Lord s bones could be broken, it would mean that the Lord s resurrection life could be hurt and broken by death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By referring to Genesis 2, we can easily see the significance of bone that it signifies resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One scriptural principle is the principle of the first mention.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to this principle, the first mention of an item in the Bible determines its meaning throughout the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By applying this principle to the bones of the Gospel of John, we see that the first place which mentions something about a bone is Genesis 2, where a rib was taken out of Adam and made into a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eve is a type of the church, Adam is a type of Christ, and the bone is a type of the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As Eve came out of Adam s bone, so the church comes out of Christ s resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eve was made from a bone, and the church is produced by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, the bone is a type of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The unbroken bone of the Lord Jesus indicates that He is the resurrection life which cannot be broken by death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, bone is a symbol, a figure, of the Lord s resurrection life, which nothing can break.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord s side was pierced, but not one of His bones was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This signifies that though the Lord s physical life was killed, His resurrection life, the very divine life, could not be hurt or damaged by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jesus was hurt, damaged, and put to death in His psuche life, His soulish life, not in His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although His human life was destroyed by death, His divine life could not be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the life with which the church is produced and built.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>B. His Side Being Pierced</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the incident regarding the Lord s bones, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water 19:34, 37 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although the Lord s resurrection life was not broken, He Himself was broken that His divine life might be released.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here, water signifies life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is portrayed in the Old Testament by the smitten rock out of which the living waters flowed to quench the thirst of the children of Israel Exo 17:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord is the rock who was smitten on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was broken so that His divine life could flow out of Him as living water.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not only did water come out of Him but also blood, the symbol of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before we can take the Lord as the living water of life, we must firstly be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, blood is mentioned as the first item and water as the second.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After we have been cleansed by the blood, then we are enabled to receive the Lord as life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These points cannot be found in the other three Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are only found in the Gospel of John, because it is a book which reveals that the Lord as life could only have been released by His death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>While the record of the other three Gospels is mainly for redemption, the record in the Gospel of John is mainly for the release of life.</S>
