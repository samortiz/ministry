   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Principle of Managing a Business</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How should we manage a business to secure the Lord's blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Acts 2 and 4, we have to divide to all according to each one's need 2:45; 4:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This sounds like a matter of simple arithmetic, but in order to register what everyone has handed over and what everyone needs, there are many works and numerous procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The "dividing" is a very complicated task.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Acts the apostles were too busy with the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were forced to select seven men full of wisdom and the Spirit to be the deacons, and they assigned the work to them 6:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is the need not only of wisdom but of the fullness of life to carry out this work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If one only has wisdom but not the Holy Spirit, his arrangement will be like a "business plan" in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Habit of Living in Equality</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The peak of the church life is when things are distributed to everyone according to his need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should do our best to give away what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is embarrassing for some brothers to have good things while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a shame for me to have something while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please give me the liberty to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let me relate my experience of handing myself over.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are things that I like to buy when I have a little money in my hand, but I always feel condemned when I have something and my co-workers do not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first time I came to Hong Kong, I bought a Dilet shaver.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of shaver is very common today, but at that time it was a famous name brand, and it was quite valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I came from a small place and considered it worthwhile to pay a little extra for it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second time I came to Hong Kong, I bought eight shavers of the same kind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I wanted to give them away to my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After I bought the shavers I realized that I could not go away without buying the blades too, and I bought eight blades as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It makes me uneasy to think that I have something while the co-workers do not.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time the church did not have the practice of handing over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was not common to do such a thing then.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not good for us to have something while other brothers do not.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is somewhat of a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we cannot make every household the same, at least we need to have the same heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I want everyone to have what I have.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to develop this habit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Bringing the whole church into the practice of Acts 2 and 4 is not that simple; it takes a great many arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, we should always be moving in this direction step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not want to go to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Arrangements for the Co-workers</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to make some arrangements for the co-workers to relieve them from anxiety over their own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can consider each co-worker as one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether or not a worker is famous and whether he is great or small, we should count him as one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Spouse and children are counted as half a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Dependent parents are also counted as half a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that the brothers who are managing businesses will do the same with the saints working under them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Practicing Equality in One's Business</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During the past few months, the profit from the pharmaceutical factory in Chungking was distributed according to units.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We could do this because all the workers were brothers and sisters and all of them had handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now the factory in Canton is going to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the employees in these factories receive the same remuneration because they are brothers and sisters, even though their position, rank, and responsibilities are different.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From the manager to the cook, all receive the same treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot do this with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a corporation consists only of brothers and sisters and if every one of them has handed himself over, there is no problem in equalizing the remuneration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Otherwise, as soon as we practice such an equalization, some will become lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The brothers and sisters who migrated to Yi-Yang are also practicing distribution according to each one's need.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some need to get married, and the rest make provision to give more.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some are sick, and the rest make provision to supply more clothing and daily necessities to them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For a few months, all of them had less than a dollar for pocket money.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some brothers work more than their assigned hours; they dare not be lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The other brothers step forward and volunteer to replace them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every brother is concerned that the others would not become over-burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Laziness is nonexistent because there is brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, everyone is afraid that others are doing too much.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Everyone sacrifices beyond the point of just denying the self.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If anyone thinks that he can be lazy and slothful as long as he has money, he is not acting like a Christian; he does not walk worthily of the name of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When a brother and a sister get married, everyone pours out over and above what he can give.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everyone does everything he can to provide the new couple with a happy, new family.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This testimony has won the approval of the local government.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Originally the county government was very suspicious.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They always sent Communist cadres to inspect us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now they have passed a law to protect us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Visiting members within a radius of two hundred and fifty miles have told us that it would take them twelve years to catch up to what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a business only consists of brothers and sisters and if all have handed themselves over, this business should be conducted after the model of Yi-Yang.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From top to bottom every worker should be treated the same.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Every brother or sister is a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Equality is the only way to success and the way to practice genuine mutual love.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Of course, some brothers who work as managers have outside needs which require special subsidy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The corporation can decide how much more they should receive.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Except for this, the brothers and sisters should all live more or less on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There should not be too big a gap.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the gap is too big, our practice will not be Christian-like.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Every brother and sister should be treated equally, and everyone has to work diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If there is any excess, it should be spent on the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>From now on, every business and every organization need proper arrangements to go on in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No one should live in luxury while others suffer in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we have more, we are in excess, while those who have less are in want.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If the households with an excess take the lead to make their resources available, the poor in the church will be given proper care.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There will be few who need special care, and their needs will be covered easily.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The church will behave like the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we hold on to our own things and care only for ourselves without any concern for others, we can never live the life of the Body of Christ, and we can never express it in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Equality does not make us lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It allows us to share our excess.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Suppose twenty brothers in a locality go into business together.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All twenty have handed themselves over and join themselves to the business on that basis.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The proceeds of the work of these twenty people are split up according to the number of units.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>These twenty people may each receive double the amount that other units receive.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>For example, ordinarily each unit may receive two loads of rice, but these ones may receive four loads of rice.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They take in more, but they also give away more for the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Actually, the amount they retain does not increase; they still take two loads of rice as others do.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The extra two loads are sent to other places, to saints who have needs.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In addition, by working this way, these brothers also supervise each others' production.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I am speaking the truth here.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If the Lord is gracious to us, all of our businesses will support each other in the future; all the units will strengthen each other, and the work of migration will be greatly enhanced.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This kind of migration is the church preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>On the one hand, we must take care of the local needs.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>On the other hand, we must take care of the needs of other places.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The brothers in Tsingtao are planning to migrate to the northwest.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In order for the church to rise up to preach the gospel, all the brothers and sisters have to endeavor for the gospel and for the work, not for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>All the working saints should consecrate themselves for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When the brothers and sisters who hold jobs join the coordination, the preaching will be prevailing, and the gospel will spread throughout China in a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The province of Chekiang alone has over three hundred churches.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The total number of local churches in the other parts of China combined do not match the number in Chekiang.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>With so many churches and so many brothers and sisters in one province, many should hand themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This handing over will greatly increase the power of the gospel.</S>
