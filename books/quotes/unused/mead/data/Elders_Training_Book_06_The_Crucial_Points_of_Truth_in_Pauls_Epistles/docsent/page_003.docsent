   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ROMANS THE DESIGNATION OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO BE THE SON OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 1:3 and 4 tell us that the gospel of God is concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, and was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, the gospel of God is concerning a Person and this Person is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, this Person has two essences or two natures the human nature and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to His human nature and essence, Christ is out of the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Third, He was designated to be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This designation is to sonize His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is both the Son of Man and the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the Son of Man He is human, possessing humanity, and as the Son of God He is divine, possessing divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The man Jesus was designated to be the Son of God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Son of God in verse 4 does not refer to Christ as the only begotten Son of God from eternity but to Christ as the firstborn Son of God referred to in Romans 8:29.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The firstborn Son of God was designated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His humanity was designated into the sonship with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The man Jesus was sonized with divinity to be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now He is not only the only begotten Son of God, but also the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the only begotten Son of God there was no humanity but only divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the firstborn Son of God there is humanity and also divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The firstborn Son of God s humanity has been designated; a man has been designated to be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His humanity has been sonized with His divinity for Him to become the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The central aim of God s gospel is to produce many sons conformed to His Son 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His firstborn Son is a pattern, a model, for the producing of the many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 1:3-4 describes this model, whereas Romans 8 reveals the mass production.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The central message of the book of Romans is that sinful, fleshly people are made sons of God and conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way Christ becomes the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to get into this crucial point, you need to spend much time to study, using the Life-study Messages on the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to tell people that the gospel is a matter of a Person who has a double nature the human nature and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His humanity has been sonized with divinity for Him to become the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We believers could be conformed to Him to be His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the learned and logical people would admire such a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They would appreciate your logics.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They would declare that the people in the local churches are the top philosophers, even today s Plato s. The teachings of Confucius have no comparison with these deeper truths.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>REVEALED IN THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 1:16 and 17 say, For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith: as it is written, But the just shall live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a very crucial point that requires much teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why is the gospel of God powerful?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is powerful because the righteousness of God is revealed in it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the righteousness of man were revealed in the gospel, the gospel would be weak, but the power of the gospel is the righteousness of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no power in the law because the law has only man s righteousness, but in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The righteousness of God in the book of Romans is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ as the righteousness of God is given to us, so the power of the gospel of God is actually Christ as the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This righteousness is revealed in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we preach the gospel, we have to preach the righteousness of God given to us, which is the very Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel out of faith to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Out of faith indicates faith as the source of the revelation of God s righteousness; to faith indicates faith as the recipient and retainer of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Romans 1:17 goes on to tell us that the just shall live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Live here indicates that we firstly receive the life, and then we live by the life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This crucial point again requires very much study and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You do not need to go to other books for your study.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just use the book of Romans with the footnotes of the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages.</S>
