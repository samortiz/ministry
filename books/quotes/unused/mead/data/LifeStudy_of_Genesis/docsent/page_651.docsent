   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let me give a testimony of our experience in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we first arrived in Taiwan, we found it to be a backward, primitive island.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nevertheless, we began to speak according to our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There were many missionaries there, especially those from the Southern Baptist denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With the mainland of China lost, they invested a great deal of money in their work on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we were small in number, we spoke according to our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This speaking of the vision caused trouble, for it stirred up opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some said, "Are only you the church?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What do you mean that you have the church life and that we don't?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our speaking was strong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We published books and a little magazine entitled The Ministry of the Word, which has had more than three hundred issues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today, through this magazine, we are still sounding the trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the past twenty-eight years, we have done a great deal of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our speaking has caused trouble, and we have suffered much opposition as a result.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, whether the missionaries agreed with us or not, they eventually were subdued and had to admit that ours was the best work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the church in Taipei alone there are more than twenty-three thousand members.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before our dream began to be fulfilled in Taiwan, we suffered a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although we suffered criticism and defamation, we never stopped speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more others tried to keep us from speaking, the more we spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We kept on speaking ourselves into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we have seen, Joseph firstly spoke himself into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But later he spoke himself out of trouble and into the fulfillment of his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All this happened through his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both the trouble and the fulfillment came by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we speak about the glorious church life, some may shake their heads in unbelief and wonder whether this can be worked out in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some have even said that it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But it did work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the past fifteen years in the United States, this dream has been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I first saw this vision fifty years ago, and wherever I have been in China, in Taiwan, or in the United States I have spoken according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whoever has said no to this vision, to him it has been impossible for it to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But to those who have said, "Yes, it is possible," to them it has been possible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more we say that the church is glorious, the more glorious it is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe strongly that the church in Anaheim will be glorious, for we shall speak ourselves into this glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Be prepared first to speak yourself into trouble and then to speak yourself out of trouble and into the fulfillment of your dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These three things will happen to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some of you may be familiar with a slanderous book called The God-Men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The preface to this book was written by a man by the name of David Adeney, whom I met more than twenty years ago when he was engaged in a student work in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He appreciated our meetings, and he sometimes attended the Lord's table meeting in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once he came to Taiwan to carry out a work on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He came to realize that our work at National Taiwan University was better than the work of others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because our gospel preaching was so prevailing, he admired it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day he came to see me and told me that our work on the campuses was very good and that he wondered whether or not we could work together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I told him that I respected his work for the gospel and that, as far as the gospel was concerned, we could work together.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, I pointed out that his goal was different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The goal of our preaching was to build up the local church, but his preaching eventually would help the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In our conversation I was very frank with him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I said, "Brother, you need to see clearly where we are and where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have two different goals.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our goal is to build up the local church as the Lord's recovery; and your work would eventually help the denominations."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In our conversation, according to what he told me, I said to him that he was out of Babylon, but only halfway to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was not yet in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Recently I received a note from a young brother telling me that this Brother Adeney had told him that in Taipei I once had said to him that he was out of Babylon, but not yet in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was pleased to hear that he still remembered this word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is difficult for me to believe that such a brother, who expressed himself to me in a very nice way, could write the preface to the slanderous book entitled The God-Men.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If I were speaking with him face to face, I would say, "Brother Adeney, don't you believe that we are God-men?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How could you write a preface to a book defaming us in this matter?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In his preface he gave people a vague, ambiguous, negative impression about me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I feel very sorry for him that he became involved in such a defaming work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All this trouble has come from my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The opposition from Melodyland and the Bible Answer Man is the result of my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today I am still speaking myself into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more opposition there is, the more I speak.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am still speaking, and I intend to speak even more.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I may speak myself into trouble, but the ones who oppose this speaking will suffer loss because of their opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Suppose when the cupbearer and the baker told Joseph about their dreams, he did not have the faith or the boldness to interpret them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Joseph could have said, "You know, friends, more than twelve years ago I had two dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I interpreted these dreams, but even now I still have not seen them fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now I don't know whether those dreams were real or not.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I dare not say."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many who saw the vision of the church during the past fifty years held an attitude similar to this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some said, "Brother Lee, we dare not say that what you are doing is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We also have seen something like this, but we're not sure about it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Time will tell."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If Joseph had expressed such an attitude to his companions in prison, nothing would have happened.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What do you suppose would have happened if Joseph had been uncertain in talking to Pharaoh?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Suppose Joseph had said, "Pharaoh, I have had some dreams, but they have not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>My interpretation of the chief cupbearer's dream has been fulfilled, but I don't know whether my dreams will ever be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, if you like, I will interpret your dreams for you."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If Joseph's attitude had been like this, Pharaoh would have sent him back to prison.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He would not have wasted his time with Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But, although Joseph's dreams had not been fulfilled, he was bold to tell Pharaoh that God would give him an answer of peace 41:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We all must learn to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Because of the vision, I cannot remain silent.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When I speak, I am restful, joyful, and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The more I speak, the more released I am.</S>
