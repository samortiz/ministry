   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE KERNEL IN EXODUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last message we saw the kernel in Genesis, Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is God s image, our life, and the One who destroyed the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these matters we have the divinity of Christ, the humanity of Christ, and the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today, we enjoy Christ s image, Christ s life, and Christ s work of destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This Christ has destroyed everything negative, including the world, sin, death, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What a wonderful Christ we have!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Out of this wonderful Christ there comes into being the church, composed of many Abels, Enoshes, Enochs, Noahs, Abrahams, Isaacs, and Jacobs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these people are the components of the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we would see what the church is, we must see the significant aspects of these people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL BEING A CORPORATE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the book of Genesis we mainly see individuals, such as Abel and Enosh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, with the last one of these individuals, Jacob, there is the house of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we come to the book of Exodus, the second book of Moses, it is no longer a matter of individuals; it is absolutely a matter of the house of Jacob, the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Exodus we do not see individual believers; we see the house of Israel as a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a type of the corporate church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this book God deals with the house, the congregation, not with individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the beginning of the book of Exodus, the house of Israel was in a fallen state in Egypt; all the Israelites were held in slavery by the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Israelites were suffering under such bondage, and they needed God s deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the Lord came into their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this coming, the Lord is signified by two kinds of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CHRIST AS THE ANGEL OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first of these persons is the Angel of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Angel who appeared to Moses in Exodus 3:2 is not a common angel; He is the Angel of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most Christian teachers agree that this Angel is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In his translation, J. N. Darby capitalizes the word Angel to show that this Angel is not a common angel, but an extraordinary Angel, even Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to verse 6, this Angel says, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the Angel of the Lord, who came to deliver the children of Israel, is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>MOSES AS A TYPE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord also came to the Israelites through Moses, who was a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Deuteronomy 18:15 Moses said, The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Prophet about whom Moses was speaking was Christ Acts 3:20-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, Moses was a shadow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Angel of the Lord came with Moses to visit Israel, this indicated that the Lord came as the Angel and as Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today, we know that Christ has come to us as the Angel of the Lord to deliver us from bondage and as Moses to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CHRIST AS THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>FOR REDEMPTION AND NOURISHMENT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord also commanded the house of Israel to prepare a lamb Exo 12:3 , which also was a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When John the Baptist saw Jesus coming to him, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Old Testament the lamb was slain on the day of the Passover, and its blood was put on the doorposts Exo 12:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the children of Israel ate the flesh of the lamb roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs Exo 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fact that the house of Israel slew the lamb, put its blood on the doorposts, and ate its flesh indicates that we must apply Christ to our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before we were saved, we were not only under bondage; we were under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we had to apply Christ both for our redemption and for our deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we apply His blood to our sins, in the eyes of God we are under His blood and we are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God passes over us because we are under the covering of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Under the blood, we enjoy Christ as the life supply, for we eat His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, we have not only the redeeming blood, but also the nourishing life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is good for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Jesus said, I am the bread of life, and, He who eats Me shall also live because of Me John 6:48, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is not only our Redeemer; He is also our life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are not only redeemed by His blood, but also nourished by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Consider the picture of the house of Israel in Exodus 12.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because the Israelites were under the blood of the lamb, God passed over them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, by eating the flesh of the lamb, they were nourished and strengthened to leave Egypt.</S>
