   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 10 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 13:44</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>44 The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first four parables in Matthew 13 were given in the boat in the open air to the crowds vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2, 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These are the parables of the sower, the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The last three were given privately to the disciples in the house v. 36 . This indicates that the things covered by these three parables are more hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In each of the first four parables there was something related to eating.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By this we see that the first four parables cover the matter of food.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's intention is to have a people on earth to be the constituents of His kingdom, and these people must be like food that is good to satisfy both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the enemy came in .Here we see Satan's subtlety.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, he sowed tares among the wheat to frustrate the growth of the wheat; second, he caused the mustard herb to grow abnormally and to lose its function; third, seeing that some wheat was produced to make fine flour for a loaf to satisfy God and man, Satan added leaven to the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the first four parables in Matthew we have the life growing, and in the next parable v. 44 we have the treasure hidden in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The treasure must be made up of gold, silver, and precious stones, probably mainly precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the following parable vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>45-46 we find the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The New Jerusalem is built with gold, precious stones, and pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the first four parables the Lord revealed the life that grows Christ into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the next two parables He revealed the matter of transformation for building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This brings us back to the basic thought of the Bible life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The parables in Matthew 13 reveal the matters of life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Life is Christ Himself as the seed sown into our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This life grows within us, growing Christ into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The growing of this life eventually produces precious stones and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After spending much time on Matthew 13, I found that its basic thought is the same as that of 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In both chapters we have God's cultivated land and God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are not impressed with this matter, we will not be able to understand the fifth and sixth parables.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The treasure hidden in the field v. 44 must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 21:18-20 . Since the church is the practical kingdom today, and the New Jerusalem will be the kingdom in manifestation in the coming age, the treasure hidden in the field must signify the kingdom hidden on God's created earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The field in verse 44 is the earth created by God for His kingdom Gen 1:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Bible the earth signifies the world created by God, and the sea signifies the world corrupted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The earth also signifies Israel, the Jewish nation, because Israel was chosen by God, separated by God, and placed by God in a specific situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the Jewish people stand before God as the earth created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Based upon the same principle, the sea also signifies the Gentile world, for the Gentiles are the people corrupted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The man here in verse 44 is Christ, who found the kingdom of the heavens in 4:12 to 12:23, hid it in 12:24 to 13:43, and in His joy went to the cross in 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; and 26:1 to 27:52 to sell all He had and to buy the field that is, to redeem the created and lost earth for the kingdom because within the earth there was the kingdom, the treasure.</S>
