Ephesians 1:4 says, 'Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love'
If we look at ourselves superficially, we may be proud, but if we consider ourselves in an honest way, we will be thoroughly disappointed
God selected us not in ourselves in our situation or in our sphere but in Christ as the means the sphere the condition and the circumstance
Because of our fallen state, our concept regarding our present, our future, and our ultimate destiny is always according to our situation
We must not look at ourselves according to ourselves, and neither should we consider the brothers according to themselves
Ephesians 1:5 says, 'Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
In God's predestination He marked us out in order to make us sons, those who are born of Him to have His life, nature, and all that He is
A couple with one child is a family, and a family like that of Jacob, who had twelve sons and one daughter, is a much greater family
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
Some may wonder how we as mere human beings can have the divine nature, and some have spoken evilly of this as an 'evolution into God'
If by the Lord's mercy we receive revelation, we will see that God has put His divine nature into the believers
When plain water is saturated with tea to have the element, color, appearance, and taste of tea, we may say that the water is 'teaified'
We have been chosen to be holy and without blemish, and we have been predestinated, pre-marked, to be the sons of God
We are still human beings, but another element has been added into our 'plain water' to 'teaify us,' that is, to sanctify us
At that time we thought that the church was simply a physical building that has a high tower with a bell in it
According to our experience, we cannot deny that as human beings we do have the divine life and the divine nature
If someone looks at a glass of plain water, he may say that there is no tea, but if he has a glass of tea-water, he will see the tea
After people attend our meeting, they should not say, 'I saw some American people, British people, young people, and older people'
Christianity today is a religion that offers a limited concept of salvation but the Lords recovery is to bring us back to the living sonship
Matthew begins with two wonderful, precious names: Jesus, which means 'Jehovah the Savior,' and Emmanuel, which means 'God with us'
About thirty-three years after His birth, this Jesus brought His disciples close to the border of the Holy Land
Romans 14:17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
In the first parable a sower went out to sow some seeds to grow wheat and in the second parable tares were sown in the field as false food
The third parable concerns a mustard seed, and the fourth parable speaks of leaven hidden by a woman in fine flour
The second group of parables is the parable of the treasure hidden in the field and the parable of a merchant buying a fine pearl
Just as the first four parables refer to things that are grown, this pair of parables speaks of things that are transformed
It is very meaningful that the treasure in Matthew 13 is hidden in the field, and the pearl comes out of the sea
Christ is the unique One who is fully entitled and qualified to take that deed, because He was the One who fully paid the price for it
He paid the price on the cross to purchase the entire earth so that one day the kingdom will be exercised on it
As the grain of sand stays in the wound, the oyster secretes its life-juice around it, causing it to become a pearl
On the one hand, it is a pearl formed by regeneration in the Gentile world, and on the other hand, it is a transformed precious stone
Consequently, we are now under the washing of the living water in the word to wash away our spots and wrinkles
Christ has abolished not only sins the world wrinkles and spots but also ordinances regulations rules rituals manners and forms of living
The American way is close to the British way, but there are still great differences that cause the two to be sometimes at enmity
Today, however, we say that East is no longer East, and West is no longer West; East and West now fit together by the cross of Christ
All the hindrances, different ways of life, and different rituals, customs, manners, and ordinances have been abolished on the cross
Some who are even deeper may say that Christ not only took away our sins and destroyed Satan and the world but also crucified our old man
The cross has crossed out not only sins, the world, Satan, our flesh, our old man, and our old nature but also the ordinances
The only way for us to be the many grains was for Christ to die so that He as the one grain could be multiplied
The death of Christ has dealt with every negative thing and has produced the many grains for the one loaf, the church
We must all see a clear vision that all the negative things that we were born into have been dealt with by Christ
We can test whether or not a group of Christians is the church by checking whether or not they satisfy people's inner hunger
Before His resurrection Christ was the unique grain, but after His resurrection this one grain became many grains, who are His brothers
As the unique grain Christ was Gods unique only begotten Son but through His death and resurrection Christ became the firstborn Son of God
The church is an entity that has been delivered from all negative things and produced and built up in resurrection
Christianity has become a religion of doctrines, and many in it do not care for the genuine experience of Christ in resurrection
When the brother told her that Christ is present everywhere, his grandmother agreed and pointed to all her pictures of Jesus
Accordingly, the word church means one thing to us, but it means something very different to many other people
He is our God, He is the Son of God, and He became a man to live on the earth for thirty-three and a half years
Now the resurrected Christ is in the heavens, and at the same time He is within us to be our life and our everything
In His resurrection Christ multiplied Himself as the one grain into many grains, which are His many brothers, the many sons of God
Because the Body of Christ is constituted with the many sons of God, the genuine church life is simply the totality of the divine sonship
The divine sonship is the church life, because every member of the church is a child of God, born anew with God's divine life and nature
The church is composed of the divine life and nature, which has been dispensed into all of us who are the children of God
Christ is not only the crucified, resurrected, and living Christ; He is also the exalted, ascended, and indwelling Christ
Not many Christians have a thorough realization of what Christ's ascension accomplished for the Body of Christ
Now Christ is there in the third heaven, and the earth, the demons, and all the principalities and powers in the air are under His feet
The surpassing power that God caused to operate in Christ also made Him Head over all things not merely for the church but to the church
He has come out of death ascended to the heavens and been exalted far above all and He has also been made Head over all things to the church
Whatever Christ is, whatever He has, and whatever He can do are transmitted into the church, which is His Body
On the one hand, our electric lamps are in our home, but according to the electricity within them, they are also in the power plant
According to our human feeling we are surely on the earth but the heavenly Christ connects us to the third heaven and the third heaven to us
Our problem is that we often have a narrow view and say, 'The world is corrupt, the age is dark, and everything is disappointing
All the insects snakes and scorpions on the earth create a poor environment but we are sitting in the third heaven looking down at them all
It is a heavenly, spiritual fact that Christ our Head has been exalted and is now far above all principalities and powers
Our position is in the exaltation of Christ, and because we are attached to the exalted Christ, we are far above all the negative things
On the day of Pentecost when Peter stood to preach, He preached not from the earth but from the third heaven to the people on the earth
Some Christians feel that it is sufficient simply to go to a Lord's Day morning 'service,' because this does not require them to do anything
The reason we do not function as members of the living Body of Christ is that we are short of the vision of Christ's ascension
We should read the New Testament again, especially the Epistles of Paul, in order to see the extent of Christ's ascension and exaltation
The church is not merely a group of religious or ethical people who are learning how to be moral and have good behavior
All negative things will be under our feet, and we will be released to function, pray, shout, and say Hallelujah!
The crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, the very Christ in the third heaven, has entered into our being to dwell there
He said that the best way to meet is to come into the hall in a quiet way, take a seat, and pray silently until the meeting time
The Pharisees wanted to rebuke the people, but the Lord said, 'If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out'
Our meetings should not be like a cemetery, in which everything is quiet, proper, and in good order because everyone there is dead
We do not insist on praising the Lord in a certain way; rather, we simply need to care for the indwelling Christ
Timothy 4:22a says, 'The Lord be with your spirit,' and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, 'He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit'
Today our God, Savior, Redeemer, Lord, and Christ is not only in the third heaven but also living in our spirit as the life-giving Spirit
It is a living composition of the crucified resurrected ascended indwelling living Christ and all His regenerated and transformed believers
To consider the indwelling of Christ not in a doctrinal way but in a very experiential way we must see the real significance of regeneration
The real human life of created man is not the physical life it is the life in the soul the soullife the life in the mind emotion and will
In the Bible distinct Greek words are used to denote the physical life in the our body and the human life in our soul
When a person dies, for example, it is his 'animal' life in his body that dies, not the human life in his soul
The human life in the soul is indicated by another Greek word, psuche, which is the root of the word psychology
Originally, we had the physical life in our body and the human life in our soul, but we did not have the divine life in our spirit
At other times, however, we can be very human, sometimes good and pleasant in a natural way and sometimes sorrowful and disappointed
The soul, our old man, the person produced by our first birth, has been crucified and buried with Christ in baptism
The part of our being that is buried with Christ is not our body or our spirit but our soul with our old person
Formerly, our spirit was merely an organ without life, but now our spirit has the divine life in it, which makes it our new person
Today we must look to the Lord that we may see that since we have been reborn, our person is no longer our soul but our spirit
Whenever the world, sin, our temper, or any such thing comes to us, we should say, 'You have come to the wrong person
According to our position, we are not on the earth but in the heavens, because we are attached to the ascended, exalted Christ
If we see that we are in the third heaven, we will be able to speak boldly to anyone to tell him that he needs Christ as his life
Many even think that since God cares for them as their Father, they may ask Him for many things, such as a new car or a better house
Today the Lord is recovering our vision and experience of the riches of the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and indwelling Christ
Now all the negative things are gone, and we have become the many grains, the many brothers, the multiplication, of the resurrected Christ
We have also been positioned in the heavens and afforded, furnished, and equipped with everything we need for our function
We may compare the application of Christ's death, resurrection, ascension, and indwelling to typesetting and printing
Rather, He is the Word who became flesh, tasted human life, passed through death and resurrection, and is now in the third heaven
They say that Christ is the Son, the second person of the Godhead, and therefore we should not say that Christ is the Spirit
We all must see that the two spirits, our regenerated human spirit and the Lord as the life-giving Spirit, are joined as one spirit
We should forget our old, religious prayers and pray in this way for a heavenly vision and a genuine realization of the indwelling of Christ
The New Testament shows us that Christ as the Word of God, who is God Himself, became flesh to be the Lamb of God
All these are included in the One who indwells us and applies to us everything that He is, has, and has obtained, attained, and gained
After the typesetting is completed, there is still the need to impress, to print, what has been typeset onto paper
Transformation includes building ; hence, it is by Christ's transforming work that the church is built up and the bride is prepared
The crucial point of the New Testament is not that husbands would love their wives or wives would submit to their husbands
Some of the great Christian teachers of the past spoke concerning the indwelling of Christ but very few touched the matter of transformation
It is regrettable that the King James Version renders the Greek word in 2 Corinthians 3:18 as 'changed' rather than as 'transformed'
Teaching husbands to love their wives and wives to submit to their husbands in an ethical way is like adding color to a dead person's face
The work of a mortician can be accomplished quickly, but the metabolic way requires at least three meals a day for a certain amount of time
The sick person will have rosy cheeks, not through an outward work of beautification but by an inward work of transformation
To merely learn something is the way of religion, which is composed of teachings with forms, rituals, and practices
We should begin the meetings while we are still at home, and while we are on the way to a meeting, we can say, 'Praise the Lord Jesus!
In the past the singing, praising, and shouting in our meetings began an hour before the scheduled meeting time
If we are short of love, someone may charge us to love our wife, but the more we exercise to try to love, the more we will not have love
Transformation spontaneously takes place by the element of Christ being added and wrought into our organic being
Christ as the indwelling One adds and imparts Himself into us when we open to Him by praising Him and calling, 'O Lord Jesus, praise You!
Opening to the Lord to take Him into us is like opening ourselves to the fresh air for all the riches in the air to come into us
We all, especially the young people, should be beside ourselves to call on the Lord and to sing, praise, and shout Hallelujah
In the earlier days of the church, when we first began to call on the name of the Lord, some were opposed to this way
Gradually however the husbands began to say Hallelujah the wives followed the husbands and the children followed to say Praise the Lord
We must all realize that the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is in us; hence, He is now the indwelling Christ
If we need the killing element, it is in Him, and if we need the nourishing and equipping element, it is also in Him
Eating, drinking, and breathing Jesus, the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and indwelling One, is the way to be transformed
As clay we can never be built up, but the more we become precious stones, the more we are built up by growing together
In this building there are the riches of life, the beauty of life, the expression of Christ, and the manifestation of God
In this way His element is added to and wrought into our being, causing an organic change, a metabolic transformation
The Lord Jesus also said, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
Now this processed and living Christ, who is seated in the heavens, comes into our being as our nourishment to transform us
His transforming work builds us up together so that we can have the church life and become His bride prepared for His coming back
