   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Eighty-one THE LORD S GRACIOUS WORDS Scripture: Luke 4:16-22 Good tidings to the poor Men are born poor.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This poverty does not refer to the lack of possessions, but to the lack of God s presence, the lack of God s blessing, the lack of life and peace, and the lack of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So in the Lord s eyes, men are absolutely poor, without anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first item of the Lord s gracious words tells us that good tidings are to be preached to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord s gospel causes us to have God and all the blessings of God, to have life and peace, and to enjoy eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Release to the captives Men are born captives.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Men s forefathers were captured by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being born of the captured forefathers, men are captives by birth, having no freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many things do not depend upon man himself, because upon man and within man there is another power controlling and reigning over him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For instance, a man may not like to have the habits of fornication and gambling, but he cannot control them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord s gracious words tell us that we, the captives, can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus is the Son of God; He has been manifested to destroy the works of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the cross He has already destroyed the Devil who has the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So today He can dispel the power of the Devil from men, and release men from the power of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, if someone was captured by a bandit, you would need someone with a greater power to conquer the bandit in order to release the captured one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Recovering of sight to the blind Man is born blind, not knowing God, not knowing the origin of the universe, not knowing the meaning of human life, not knowing the destiny of man, and not knowing the snares of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All these items of not knowing prove that man is born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord s gracious words tell us that the blind recover their sight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because the Lord is light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the One who can shine upon the eyes of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This enables man to know God and know the origin of the universe, to have a full understanding of the meaning of human life and the destiny of man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, man is also able to recognize the snares and deceit of Satan, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Liberty to the oppressed Men are born oppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Men are not only captives in Satan s hands, but also are oppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Men s oppressions include the oppression that comes from physical burdens, such as the burdens of family, business, education, and sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Men s oppressions also include psychological oppressions which come from dissatisfaction of the heart, restlessness, unhappiness, uneasiness, and bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of these are psychological burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people may have no physical burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They may have abundance in their living, good physical health, and their business, profession or education may all be very smooth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But they still have psychological burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then there may be some who have no physical or psychological burdens, but instead feel guilty in their consciences and are afraid of death, hell, and God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are afraid of God examining their living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are burdens of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, no one is free from oppression.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s gracious words tell us that the oppressed may be set free.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord can free us from our physical burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He can heal our sickness and bear the burden of all our weaknesses and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So He says, Come unto me, all ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord can satisfy our psychological need and rid us of all psychological oppression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Much more Christ can bear the burden of the punishment for sin and the burden of the conscience, so that men no longer need to be oppressed in the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many who were afraid of the punishment for sin and were afraid of hell had peace in their conscience as soon as they received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The acceptable year of the Lord Since the day man sinned, the whole life of the entire human race has been miserable and disastrous, having no peace, no joy, no freedom, and no light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man s condition is described by the four points previously mentioned: poor, in captivity, blind, and oppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord s gracious words tell us that now is the acceptable year.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since the coming of the Lord, a new era has started in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Adam fell, human history entered the age of misery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Christ came, an age of joy began in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This happy and blissful age is the acceptable year of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Adam s sin caused God to forsake man and to condemn man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But when Christ came, His redemption caused God not only to forgive man, but also on the positive side, to accept man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Acceptance includes: reconciliation between man and God, resolving the problem that formerly existed between man and God, and God being pleased with man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Conclusion:</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord s gracious words give us six items: 1 the gospel s good tidings, 2 release, 3 sight, 4 liberty, 5 the acceptable year, and 6 God s acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How to receive the Lord s gracious words Confess our condition according to the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is to confess that we are poor, in captivity, blind, oppressed, and miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Believe the words of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Believe the gospel, and what the gospel will bring to us: release, sight, liberty, the acceptable year, and God s acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To believe is to receive according to the Lord s words.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Repeat the words in Luke 4:18-19.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Believe whatever the Lord says.</S>
