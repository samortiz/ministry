   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN THE GREAT RED DRAGON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HIS PERSECUTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are three main figures in Revelation 12: the woman, the man-child, and the great red dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Throughout the centuries, there has been war between the woman and the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, the battle has not been fought by the woman, but by the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This chapter covers all the generations from Genesis 3:15 until the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But it especially gives a more detailed portrait of Satan s activity during the last three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This warfare began in Genesis 3:15, and it will consummate in the last three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The woman with the man-child and the serpent, which has become the great dragon, will fight until the time of the resurrection of the dead overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When all the dead overcomers are resurrected as one entity, the man-child will come into full existence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This single entity, the stronger part of God s people, will be raptured before the great tribulation, not to the air, but to the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the rapture of the man-child, there will be the final three and a half years, or the twelve hundred sixty days.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the man-child has been raptured to the throne of God, there will be war in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the overcoming saints will exert a great influence upon the coming warfare in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This war will not begin until the overcoming saints have been resurrected and raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After this, there will be war between Satan and his angels and Michael, the archangel, and his angels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before Satan fell, he was also an archangel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After the man-child has been raptured to the throne, there will no longer be any place there for the dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, the dragon will be defeated and cast down to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When he comes to earth, the great tribulation will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During this period of time, the dragon will do everything possible to damage the man created by God for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because up until now God has not yet gained the man-child, He has not had a way to cast Satan from heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God needs a corporate man to accomplish this for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The picture in Revelation 12, which concentrates on the last three and a half years, portrays a complete picture of the enmity between the serpent and the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Satan has been cast down to earth, he will cause great damage to the woman, who will still be on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this message we need to consider the great red dragon and his persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I. THE DRAGON</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 3 says, And another sign was seen in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While the serpent is the subtle one, the dragon is the cruel one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. Great</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 3 says that the dragon is great.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Genesis 3, Satan was a serpent, a smaller creature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here he has become a dragon, much greater than a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because the serpent has been eating a great deal throughout the centuries, he has been enlarged into a great dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. Red</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This great dragon is red.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Red here signifies the shedding of blood caused by Satan s murders John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Abel was the first martyr murdered by the dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Matthew 23:35 the Lord Jesus spoke of the blood of Abel the righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The dragon is not only great because of his eating, but is also red because of his murdering so many overcomers throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>C. Seven Heads</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The great red dragon has seven heads, which are the seven Caesars of the Roman Empire 13:1; 17:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we come to 13:1, we shall see that these seven heads are the heads of the beast and that the beast will not only be the Roman Empire but also Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 17:9 and 10, we are told that the seven heads are seven Caesars.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That the dragon has seven heads, which are the heads of the seven Caesars and of the beast, Antichrist, indicates that the dragon and the beast are one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that the seven Caesars of the Roman Empire are the heads of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By this we see that the Roman Empire, especially Antichrist, is the embodiment of Satan.</S>
