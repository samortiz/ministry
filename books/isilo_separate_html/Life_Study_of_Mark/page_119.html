Verse 28 says, &ldquo;Now from the fig tree learn the parable: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near.&rdquo; This fig tree signifies the nation of Israel, which the Lord cursed in 11:14. It passed through a long &ldquo;winter,&rdquo; from the first century to 1948, when the nation of Israel was restored. That was its branch becoming tender and the putting forth of its leaves. This fig tree is a sign to the believers of the end of this age.</p><p>To &ldquo;become tender&rdquo; signifies that life has come back, and to &ldquo;put forth leaves&rdquo; signifies outward activities. Winter signifies the time of being dried up, the time of tribulation; &ldquo;summer&rdquo; signifies the age of the restored kingdom (Luke 21:30-31), which will begin at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p><p>In verses 29 and 30 the Lord goes on to say, &ldquo;So also you, when you see these things happening, you know that He is near, at the doors. Truly I tell you, that this generation shall by no means pass away until all these things happen.&rdquo; The &ldquo;generation&rdquo; here is not that according to age or people, as the generations in Matthew 1:17. Instead, it is the generation according to the moral condition of the people, as the generation in Matthew 11:16; 12:39, 41, 42, 45; and Proverbs 30:11-14.</p><p>In verses 31 and 32 the Lord says, &ldquo;The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away. But concerning that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor even the Son, but the Father.&rdquo; The Son, standing in the position of the Son of Man (v. 26), does not know the day or hour of His coming back.</p><p>In 13:33-37 the Lord speaks strongly concerning watching. In verse 33 He says, &ldquo;Beware, be watchful; for you do not know when the time is.&rdquo; In verse 35 He tells the disciples, &ldquo;Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house comes, whether in the evening, or at midnight, or at cock-crowing, or in the morning.&rdquo; Finally, in verse 37, the last verse of the chapter, He says, &ldquo;And what I say to you, I say to all, Watch!&rdquo; To be sure, the Lord&rsquo;s word about watching is more than a prophecy; it is also a charge to all the believers of the Slave-Savior. On the one hand, we need to know the prophecies concerning the things to come. On the other hand, we need to watch.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REVIVING OF THE FIG TREE<br />AND THE DELIVERY OF THE NEW MAN</h2><p>Many aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy in Mark 13 have been fulfilled. In particular, we have seen the re-formation of the nation of Israel and the return of Jerusalem to the Jews. This may be considered the reviving of the fig tree that was cursed. Although its branch has already become tender and it has begun to put forth its leaves, we do not yet see any fruit. Rather, we may say that the leaves are merely an outward display. The nation of Israel today has an outward display, but it does not yet have fruit.</p><p>If you study a map, you will see that the nation of Israel is the center of the inhabited earth geographically, politically, and even militarily. The situation in the Middle East is a serious problem. The surrounding Arab nations do not seem to have a way to deal with the small nation of Israel.</p><p>The re-formation of Israel is a fulfillment of a number of crucial prophecies in the Bible. Israel has been re-formed, Jerusalem has been returned, and the fig tree is now showing its leaves. This should cause us to realize that summer is near. However, we cannot say how long it will be until summer.</p><p>While the nation of Israel is flourishing, the birth, the delivery, of the new man continues to take place. The flourishing of Israel and the delivery of the new man are taking place in a parallel way. This indicates that the recovery of the church life should go on in parallel with the flourishing of the nation of Israel. This twofold development will reach its climax almost at the same time, the time of the great tribulation.</p><p>After studying the first thirteen chapters of the Gospel of Mark, we see that it is not a simple matter to be prepared to enter into the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection. First we need to pass through the steps of the long process recorded in chapters one through ten. Then we need to follow the Slave-Savior to Jerusalem, where He prepared the environment, the opposers, and His disciples for His redemptive work. We also need to hear His word regarding the things to come concerning the Jews, the church, the world situation, the great tribulation, and the Antichrist.</p><p>We need to study the biblical prophecies not merely to have a knowledge of the prophecies, but especially to have a view of what the Lord is doing today and to understand the purpose of the world situation. From our study of the Scriptures we know what the Lord is doing, and we know the purpose of the world situation. It is for the completion of the nation of Israel and also for the completion of the birth of the new man. Although we are not part of the nation of Israel, as believers in Christ we certainly are part of the new man.</p><p>In order to have the new man, we need to experience Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. Through His death and resurrection we may have the full enjoyment of the wonderful Person of Christ as our replacement. This is the clear view of God&rsquo;s economy presented in chapters one through thirteen of the Gospel of Mark.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_118.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_120.html">Next</a> </body></html>
