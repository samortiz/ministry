<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Having Ten Horns</H2><P>The beast had ten horns (7:20a). This signifies that it had ten kings (Rev. 17:12-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. A Small Horn Coming Up<br>among the Ten Horns, and Three of Them<br>Being Uprooted before It</H2><P>A small horn came up among the ten horns, and three of them were uprooted before them (Dan. 7:8a, 20b, 24). This signifies that Antichrist will come up among the ten kings, and before him three of them will be destroyed. In this way Antichrist will become the strongest horn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. In This Horn There Being Eyes<br>Like the Eyes of a Man<br>and a Mouth Speaking Great Things</H2><P>In this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things (Dan. 7:8b, 20c, 25a). This signifies that Antichrist will have sharp sight to perceive things and a mouth to speak great things against God (Rev. 13:5a, 6). Because of this, Antichrist will be slain, and his body will be destroyed and given to the burning fire (Dan. 7:11; Rev. 19:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. This Horn Waging War with the Saints</H2><P>This horn (Antichrist) waged war with the saints, wore out the saints of the Most High for three and a half years, and prevailed against them (Dan. 7:21, 25; Rev. 13:7a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. This Horn Intending<br>to Change the Times and the Law</H2><P>This horn (Antichrist) intended to change the times and the law (Dan. 7:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. This Horn Being Judged by God<br>and His Dominion Being Taken Away</H2><P>This horn (Antichrist) will be judged by God, and his dominion will be taken away, so that it will be annihilated and destroyed unto the end (vv. 11b, 26).</P>
