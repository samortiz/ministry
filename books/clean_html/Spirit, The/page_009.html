<h2 class="head1">THE COMPOUNDED SPIRIT&mdash;THE COMPOUND SPIRIT<br />
TYPIFIED BY THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</h2>
<p>The compounded Spirit is the compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment (Exo. 30:22-31). An ointment is composed of some elements compounded with oil. In the old edition of the Newberry Bible, there is a note in Exodus 30 that says the anointing oil refers to the Holy Spirit. The Newberry Bible was put out by the open Brethren. The Lord went on to show us that the Spirit, typified by the ointment, is a compound Spirit. The Brethren saw that the anointing ointment in Exodus 30 is the Holy Spirit, but they did not see that this Holy Spirit, as typified in Exodus 30, is a compound Spirit. This Spirit is compounded with a number of elements.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man and God Compounded Together</h2>
<p>The compound ointment is composed first of a hin of olive oil. Then four spices are added to the oil. These spices, or elements, are myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. When these four elements are blended with the oil, they become a compound ointment. The one hin of olive oil is compounded with four elements. The number one refers to the unique God, and the number four refers to the creatures. Among the creatures, man takes the lead, so we can say that the number four refers to man. Man is typified by the four spices of the plant life. The compounding of the four spices with the oil signifies that man and God are compounded together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Flowing Myrrh&mdash;the Sweet Death of Christ</h2>
<p>Flowing myrrh refers to the sweet death of Christ. His death is a positive death. The only death in the whole universe that is positive is Christ&rsquo;s death. The death of Christ is sweet.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sweet Cinnamon&mdash;the Sweet Effectiveness<br />
of Christ&rsquo;s Death</h2>
<p>Sweet cinnamon typifies the sweet effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death. The positive death of Christ signified by myrrh is very fragrant, full of cinnamon. Cinnamon adds flavor and sweetness to food. If we are not experiencing Christ&rsquo;s death, our life is not very sweet. When a husband and wife quarrel, that is not sweet. How can they neutralize such a situation? They need to put the death of Christ into their marriage life. Then their marriage life will be sweet. If a person does not have the cross in his daily life, it will be hard to get along with him. The sweet death of Christ needs to be added to our daily life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sweet Calamus&mdash;<br />
the Power of Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection</h2>
<p>The third element added to the oil is sweet calamus, which signifies the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Calamus is a reed that grows in a marsh or a muddy place. Even though it grows in a marsh, it is able to shoot up into the air. According to the sequence of the spices, calamus signifies the rising up of the Lord Jesus from the place of death. The Lord was put into a marsh, into a death situation, but in resurrection He rose up and stood up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Cassia&mdash;the Flavor<br />
of the Power of Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection</h2>
<p>Cassia signifies the flavor of the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. In ancient times, cassia was a repellent to insects and snakes. Only the power of the resurrected Christ can repel all the evil &ldquo;insects&rdquo; and especially the old serpent, the devil.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Triune God Typified<br />
by the Three Units of Five Hundred Shekels</h2>
<p>In the compound ointment, there are five hundred shekels of myrrh, two hundred fifty shekels of cinnamon, two hundred fifty shekels of calamus, and five hundred shekels of cassia. In between the five hundred shekels of myrrh and the five hundred shekels of cassia are two items of two hundred fifty shekels. These two added together form one unit of five hundred shekels. Eventually, we may say that there are three units of five hundred shekels in the compound ointment. The middle unit is split into two parts. This is very meaningful. Among the Three of the Trinity, the Son, typified by the second unit of five hundred shekels, was &ldquo;split,&rdquo; crucified, on the cross. The three units of five hundred shekels typify the Triune God, and the Triune God went to the cross in the second person of His Trinity, in the Son.</p>
