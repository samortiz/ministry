   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Going Home to Tell Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Mark 5:1-20 we see a person who was demon possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the most severe case of demon possession recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A legion of demons was within this man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He dwelt among the tombs, and no one was able to bind him, not even with a chain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Night and day, he would cry out among the tombs and in the mountains and gash himself with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Lord commanded the demons to come out from him, they did and entered into about two thousand hogs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They all rushed down the steep slope into the sea and drowned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the demon possessed man was saved, the Lord said to him, "Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you" v. 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After you are saved, the Lord wants you to tell your family, neighbors, relatives, friends, and colleagues that you are now a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should tell them not only that you have believed in Jesus but also what great things the Lord has done for you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord wants you to tell others what He has done for you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He wants you to confess and witness to others what has happened to you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Others will be lit when you do this, and salvation will continue on; it will not stop with you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a pity that many souls in Christian families are on the way to eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some of our parents, children, relatives, and friends have not heard the gospel of Christ from our own mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They have only the blessing and happiness of the present age, without the hope of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why should we withhold from telling them what the Lord has done for us?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are the ones who are right next to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If they cannot hear the gospel from us, who else can?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to witness to our family, we must show them the great change in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must show our family what a wonderful change has been wrought in our lives since we believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only then will they listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They will not have confidence in anything less than this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must be more righteous, more self-sacrificing, more loving, more diligent, and more joyful than before.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They will not believe us if there is no change in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time, we need to witness to them the reason for this change.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>C. Proclaiming in the Synagogue</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Acts 9:19-21 says, "He was with the disciples in Damascus for some days.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, that this One is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And all who heard him were amazed and said, Is this not the one who ravaged those who call upon this name in Jerusalem and came here for this, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Saul was on his way to Damascus to bind the believers of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But he met the Lord on the way and the Lord spoke to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The moment light came, he fell on his face and became blind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The men who journeyed with him led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was there three days without seeing, eating, or drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord sent Ananias to lay his hands upon him, and he received sight, rose up, and was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After he had taken food, he was strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After a few days he immediately went into the synagogues to proclaim that Jesus is the Son of God and to witness to others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was obviously difficult for him to do this because he had been persecuting the Lord's disciples all along.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He could have been a member of the Sanhedrin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Jewish Sanhedrin was comprised of seventy-one persons, and he could have been one among the seventy-one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He had secured a letter from the high priest and was on his way to bind the believers of the Lord and to bring them before the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What should he do now that he had believed in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Originally, he was going to bind those who believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now he himself was in danger of being bound.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Humanly speaking, he should have escaped or hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, he went into the synagogues, not just one but many, to prove that Jesus is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This shows us that the first thing a person should do upon receiving the Lord is testify for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After Paul received his sight, he went at the first opportunity to testify that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every believer of the Lord should do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everyone in this world knows that there is a Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But they only know Jesus as one among millions of men in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, Jesus is considered merely as one man among many.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although they regard Him as being a little more special than others, He is still an ordinary man to them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But one day light and revelation came to you; the eyes of your heart were enlightened, and you discovered something.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You discovered that this Jesus is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You discovered that God has a Son!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Jesus is the Son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What a great discovery!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You discovered that there is one man among all men who is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is truly tremendous!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When a person receives the Lord Jesus as his Savior and confesses Him as the Son of God, he is doing a great thing, a tremendous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He cannot let the occasion pass by lightly, because it is a momentous event.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Of the millions of men in this world, he has discovered One who is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What a great and tremendous discovery this is!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Among the billions of men throughout history, he has suddenly found out that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is indeed a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We would marvel if someone were to discover an angel among us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How much more marvelous is it when someone discovers the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We do not know how many million times more superior the Lord is than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is no comparison between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The angels are far, far inferior to our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Here was a man on his way to bind all those who believed in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But after he fell and rose up, he went into the synagogues and proclaimed that Jesus is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He either was mad or had received a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He was not mad.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Indeed, he had received a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He actually had met the One among millions of men who is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Like Paul, you also have met this Man among men, the One who is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you realize how great the discovery you have made is and how important and wonderful your discovery is, you surely will tell others immediately, "I have met the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You surely will proclaim aloud, "Jesus is the Son of God!"</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>How can a person sit still and act as if nothing has happened when he has believed in the Lord Jesus and is saved?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If a person has believed in the Lord Jesus and yet does not feel anything, if he considers this to be nothing marvelous or special, we doubt whether he has believed at all.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Here is something great, marvelous, extra- ordinary, special, beyond all imagination Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is too crucial a matter!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is not too much for a man who has seen such an important matter to knock on the door of his friends' house after midnight to tell them of his discovery.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A marvelous thing has happened in the universe Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Here was a man who had just recovered from his illness; he had just had his sight restored.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We see him running immediately into the synagogues and proclaiming, "Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God!"</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Every believer who has seen the same should go to the synagogues and shout, "Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God!"</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Every time we consider how Jesus of Nazareth can be the Son of God, we feel that this is the greatest discovery in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>No discovery can be more amazing and more crucial than this.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What a tremendous thing for us to discover that this man is the Son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When Peter told the Lord, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God," the Lord Jesus told him, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" Matt 16:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>While He was among us in disguise, no one knew Him except those who had the Father's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Brothers and sisters, never consider your faith to be a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You need to realize that your faith is a wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Saul had to go into the synagogues to speak because he knew that his discovery was too wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>You will do the same if you realize how wonderful the things you have seen are.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is a most wonderful and glorious fact.</S>
