   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE CHRIST HIS PERSON 5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall cover the matter of Christ s person in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>C. IN CREATION 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Creator</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since God is the Creator of all things and since Christ is God, He surely is also the Creator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is clearly revealed in Hebrews 1:10: You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse, a quotation from Psalm 102:25, is applied to Christ the Son and indicates that, as God, Christ created heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, Christ is the Creator of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Word through Whom</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All Things Came into Being</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is not only the Creator but also the Word through whom all things came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is not only the Creator but also the means through which creation came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Speaking of Christ as the Word, John 1:3 says, All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see that creation came into being through the Word, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What does it mean that all things came into being through Him and that apart from Him nothing has come into being?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It simply means that apart from Him nothing has existence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day, through the Word as the means, many things came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may say that, in a sense, the Creator did not need to work in order to make anything, for there was no need for Him to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He simply spoke, and everything had being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to our concept, creation requires labor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, in God s creation there was no labor, only speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God said, Let there be light, light came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When He said, Let there be an expanse, the expanse came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He said, Let the dry land appear, the dry land appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through the all-inclusive Christ as the Word all things came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you know what creation is?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Creation is the calling of things not being as being through the Word Rom 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Word is both the means and the sphere of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may not differentiate Christ as the Creator from Christ as the means of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even we may interpret John 1:3 as meaning that the Word is the Creator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, this verse does not say that the Word was the Creator; instead, this verse says that through the Word all things came into being, indicating that the Word was the means through which the Creator created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is both the Creator and the means by which all things were created.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although as God Christ is the Creator, John 1:3 reveals that as the Word He was the means of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to this verse, all things came into existence through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The King James Version of John 1:3 says, All things were made by him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, this is not an accurate translation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Greek preposition should be rendered through and not by.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, this verse does not say that all things were created by Christ but that all things came into existence through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that Christ is the means of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is in fact the Creator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The point we are emphasizing here is that Christ is the Word through whom all things came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the means of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hebrews 11:3 says, By faith we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not come into being from things which appear.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to consider this verse along with the last part of Hebrews 1:2, which says that through Christ the universe was made.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Scientists are trying to learn how the universe was framed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to the book of Hebrews, the universe was framed through Christ as the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God spoke, and the universe came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ as the Word of God to be the means through which God s creation came into being implies also that, as the means of God s creation, Christ speaks God, defines God, and explains God.</S>
