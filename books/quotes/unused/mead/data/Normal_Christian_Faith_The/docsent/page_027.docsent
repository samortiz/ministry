   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DID IT HAPPEN OR NOT?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the same day, their opponent gave the rebuttal.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let me briefly mention a few of his arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He said, "Our friends have denied the possibility of such an event on the ground of biological law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am here to ask whether such an event happened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They asked, 'Can this happen?'</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They referred you to academic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am asking, 'Has this happened?'</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I point to a historical occurrence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is one thing to be academically justified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is another thing to be historically recorded."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As he was speaking, he drew out a newspaper from his pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the paper was an article about an accident that had happened a few days earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A man was driving on a winding mountain road.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Due to carelessness, the car slid and tumbled down a deep gorge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The car was totally wrecked.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not even a square foot of the vehicle was left untouched.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was thoroughly damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the man on the ground was absolutely unhurt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Later, he rose up and walked away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The theologian read the passage aloud and said, "This car tumbled down a thousand feet into ruin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You cannot even find a square foot of whole metal, and yet the man was unharmed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My friends would ask, 'Could this man live?'</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But my question is, 'Is this man alive?'</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is alive!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you consider the possibility, there is none.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if you consider the fact, there it is!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we have is a historical fact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we try to study the virgin birth from a scientific point of view, we may conclude that this is an impossible event.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But my question is whether or not such an event occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Gospel of Matthew says that Jesus was born of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So does the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At least you have to say that these records have said such a thing and that such an event was recorded in history.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At least you have to believe that there is a historical event.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>WRITTEN AFTER CAREFULLY INVESTIGATING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am not asserting that Matthew and Luke were inspired by the Holy Spirit when they wrote their books.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether these books were divinely inspired or not, we will set aside for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are saying that there were a few people who followed Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They wrote His biography.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both Matthew and Luke were contemporaries of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew followed Him for more than three years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Luke was not as close, but he "carefully investigated all things" Luke 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I believe that when he wrote his gospel, the mother of Jesus was still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What did they say about the birth of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They all testified that Jesus was born of the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His birth was absolutely different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today, after almost two thousand years, some who never saw Jesus, never talked to Mary His mother, and never met Joseph His father, conclude that He was not born of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How can you say that He was not born in this manner?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Are you ruling out the possibility of such an event and concluding that it did not happen because of some arguments you proposed in your study room or some theories you fashioned in the laboratory?</S>
