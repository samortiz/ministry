   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH NOT BEING A PHYSICAL BUILDING FOR WORSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The characteristic of the church in the beginning was her simplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church today, having been altered, is no longer so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the principle of simplicity, when the early church was raised up, she did not have many of the things that we see in Christianity today, not even a physical place for worship, such as a cathedral something so greatly valued today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The believers met at times in public squares, sometimes in the portico of Solomon, and at other times in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Basically, there were no chapels or cathedrals.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The concept of building physical places for worship did not exist until the degradation of the church under Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Roman Catholic Church brought the heathen customs and practices, including idolatry, into Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who are knowledgeable about architecture all agree that the best buildings and structures in Europe are the cathedrals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is reported that St. Peter's Cathedral in the Vatican was built at a cost of 90,000,000 pounds sterling, which is equivalent to several times that in dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows how highly regarded the cathedrals are in degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The temple in the Old Testament was a physical building, and the temples or shrines of the Gentile idols were also physical structures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The holy temple was considered the best building structure among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The former temple was torn down, and it took forty-six years for the latter one to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, in China the best architecture in every place is also seen in the temples or shrines.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, when the church was first raised up, the worship of God was "neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem" but "in spirit" John 4:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God cares only for our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, the Bible tells us that, individually, our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that God dwells in us 1 Cor 6:19; Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Corporately, the church is God's house, God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that God dwells in the church 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the church is not a physical building for religious worship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to man's religious concept, a house used for church meetings is different from any ordinary house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once I met a group of believers in Tientsin who called their meeting place the "holy assembly hall."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I wondered if these people would not also call their homes "holy residences."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Surely, a meeting hall and a regular house are different, but the difference is only in what they are being used for and not in whether they are holy or common.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord began His recovery in China, Christians were raised up to take the way of the recovery in many major cities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time there was a group of young believers who were studying medicine in Ch'i-Lu University.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After they had seen the light of the Lord, they loved Him fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since they were students who lived in dormitories, they did not have a home or a place to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, they held their first Lord's table in a cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They placed the bread and the cup on a table used for offering sacrifices, and in this way they worshipped and remembered the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All those who attended that meeting testified that they had never touched the reality of heaven or sensed the loveliness of the Lord as much as during that particular time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE CHURCH BEING NOT A PHYSICAL BUILDING BUT A SPIRITUAL BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is really simple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She is so simple that it seems she has nothing with respect to rules or regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today, however, it seems that we cannot break the bread or worship the Lord unless we have a piano and a table.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Please remember that this is a degraded and deformed situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Someone may say that in the Catholic Church the cathedrals are imposing, the sacred songs are solemn, and the bishops are awe-inspiring.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It has never occurred to him that these are items in a deformed situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In contrast, there was nothing attractive outside or inside of the meeting hall of the church in Shanghai, yet every time there was a meeting, the hall was full.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One time, two overseas Chinese attended a meeting there and were greatly astonished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One of them said, "I saw many places of worship in America, but they were never filled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I never imagined that when I came back to my homeland I could see people packed into such an unattractive place."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was marvelous to him but not to us because the early church was the same way considering the physical things as nonessential.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As children of God, we must realize that all physical things will eventually be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should build only the things that are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Degraded Christianity always likes to show people a grand piano, a beautiful pulpit, and an exquisite fa ade.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church does not necessarily receive more of God's blessings by having a splendid building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, when the church has the presence of God with His life, power, and strength, this is really God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sometimes the believers have a desire to meet outdoors, but some are concerned about not having a podium or a piano.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Actually, in the beginning the church did not have these things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Physical things are not essential because what we are building is not something physical but something spiritual for people to be strengthened from within.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is God's intention.</S>
