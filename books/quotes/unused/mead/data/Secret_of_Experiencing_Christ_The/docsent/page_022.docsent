   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Today Christ is the Son of God in two respects: He is God's only begotten Son and He is also God's firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, if He were only God's only begotten Son, He could not have any brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To have us as His brothers, He must possess humanity; but as God's only begotten Son in eternity past, He possessed only divinity, not humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, in His incarnation Christ put on humanity, and through resurrection He brought this humanity into sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this way He became God's firstborn Son with both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then, as the life-giving Spirit, He entered into us to make us also sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we are the many sons of God being conformed to the image, not of God's only begotten Son, but of His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, as God's firstborn Son, Christ has many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all need to see that being born as the firstborn Son of God was a great work which Christ accomplished through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although it is clearly taught in the Bible, many Christians have never seen this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the day of His resurrection Christ was begotten by God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He became the firstborn Son of God in order to produce many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to realize that the date of our regeneration was the date of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Christ was resurrected from among the dead, we, all the believers, were resurrected with Him 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through His resurrection He was born to be God's firstborn Son, and at the same time all His believers were born to be the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the day of Christ's resurrection, all God's chosen people were resurrected and were born to be God's many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now God has many sons with both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But among these many sons, only the Firstborn is His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This only begotten Son of God, in His resurrected humanity, is also the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the firstborn Son of God, He has both divinity and humanity, and we His believers as God's many sons also possess both the human nature and the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now day by day we are being conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To Release His Divine Life for His Propagation</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His resurrection Christ also released His divine life for His propagation John 12:24; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord Jesus died as the grain of wheat, His inner divine life rose up to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In His resurrection this life was released to produce many grains as His multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This multiplication is His propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The one grain was propagated into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ accomplished this great work in His resurrection.</S>
