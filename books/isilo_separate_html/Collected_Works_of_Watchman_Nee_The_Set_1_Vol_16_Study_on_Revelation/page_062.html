Revelation 17:10</H2><P>"And are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain only a short time." </P><P>The Brethren consider the seven kings to be seven political systems, but this is against the principle of the Scriptures. The reasons are:</P><P>(1) The seven kings are mentioned in the words of explanation by the angel; hence, they cannot be interpreted further.</P><P>(2) The Bible never symbolizes a political system by a king. This is not even found in non-Christian writings.</P><P>(3) A king speaks of a political system already (a monarchy or a constitutional monarchy). How can a king symbolize another type of political system?</P><P>(4) Although some have broken down the Roman Empire into seven different political systems, the seven kings here are successive, while the seven political systems are not successive; they are unrelated, rising and falling at different times, and are intermittent.</P><P>(5) If the seven kings refer to seven political systems, what do the ten kings refer to? Would not this mean that the ten kings must also refer to ten political systems? If this is the case, would there not be seventeen political systems in Rome?</P><P>(6) Verse 9 says that each of the seven heads upon which the woman sits are mountains. It is impossible for some to be mountains while others are not. In the same way, all of the seven kings must be kings.</P><P>(7) In the Bible, the word "head" always refers to a person. How can we say that it refers to a political system? The "four heads" in Daniel 7:6 refer to four kings and not to four systems. Why should Revelation use the seven kings to symbolize seven political systems?</P><P>(8) If the kings represent political systems, then during the reign of Constantine, Christianity should have been considered as another system. However, Revelation 12:3 says that the seven heads are on the dragon, signifying that all the heads are of Satan. Can we say that Christianity is also of Satan?</P><P>Some may criticize, saying, "Rome had twelve Caesars, with Domitian, at the time of John, as the twelfth. How can one say that there were only seven kings in Rome?" We turn the question back to these ones: How could there have been only seven churches? Of course, the seven churches are only the representatives of all the churches.</P><P>Some may say that even if the seven kings are the representatives of the kings in Roman history, how can we know which of the twelve Caesars these seven kings are? This we can find out from the following points:</P><P>(1) Revelation 13:1 says, "And on his heads names of blasphemy." Hence, all of these seven kings must have claimed deity and forced men to worship them as gods.</P><P>(2) The words "have fallen" in 17:10 refer to their sudden death (cf. Judg. 3:25; 2 Sam. 1:19, 25, 27). Hence, all of these seven kings had to die a sudden death. Before John there were five emperors: Julius Caesar (the first Caesar), Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. All five of these emperors declared themselves to be gods and forced men to worship them as gods. Each of them died either by committing suicide or by being murdered.</P><P>Domitian was the sixth. He was still alive at the time of John. He also declared himself to be a god and was also murdered.</P><P>The seventh is the one who "has not yet come." The Bible does not tell us how long it is after the sixth king that the seventh king will come. It tells us only that the seventh king will remain on earth for "only a short time" (Rev. 17:10). Eventually, he will be killed (13:3, 14). The time between the sixth and the seventh kings is the time in which religious Rome reigns. The time of the first through fifth kings and the time of the seventh and eighth kings are the time in which political Rome reigns. At this time, religious Rome is replacing political Rome.</P><P>After Zedekiah was taken captive into Babylon, there was a period of time in which there was no king in Israel. This period lasted until the time of the birth of Christ. In the same way, after the fall of the Roman Empire, there is a period of time before Antichrist appears.</P><P>When Antichrist comes, the whole world will be ready. Once Antichrist comes on the scene, he will be able to do many things within three and a half years because by then the seventh one will be ready.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> </body></html>
