   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapters eighteen, nineteen, and twenty are a distinct section of the Gospel of Matthew dealing with the relationships among the kingdom people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to have an overall view of these three chapters, which cover five matters: pride, our inability to forgive others the root of which lies in our dispositional anger, lust, riches, and ambition.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Humility will rescue us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In both of its aspects, universal and local, the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having authority to bind and to loose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If any believer refuses to hear the church, he will lose the fellowship of the church and will be like the Gentile the heathen and the tax collector the sinner , who are outside the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a one is cut off from the fellowship of the church in order that this loss of fellowship may encourage him to repent and to recover his fellowship with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter eighteen we see how to deal with someone who offends others as well as the seriousness of offending others.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you offend me, I need to look to the Lord for the grace to forgive you from my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do this, we will have the proper kingdom life and will share in the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The religionists' temptation Matt 19:3 afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal that marriage life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3-12 and our attitude toward riches vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>16-30 are related to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Marriage life touches the matter of lust, and our attitude toward riches touches the matter of covetousness.</S>
