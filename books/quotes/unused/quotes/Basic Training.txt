When he comes to Isaiah 6, he will see that he is a man of unclean lips living among a people of unclean lips, and thus he would repent
A picture taken of us by a photographer is nice only in the outward appearance, but the Bible shows us how ugly and evil we are inwardly
Our ears can listen to God's word, our eyes can behold His revelation, and our tongue can utter something for Him
When we are in this condition, we are afraid of being seen by others, afraid that they will not understand what is happening to us
When we are filled with the Spirit, we may spontaneously repent for condemning others and ask the Lord to forgive us
When we are deflated, we are the worst ones, even as bad as Satan, but when we are filled with the Spirit, we are truly saints
The New Testament does not give us a full definition of the church, but we do see a complete picture of the church in the New Jerusalem
In the coming messages we shall consider these mysteries in detail, especially the mysteries of man, Christ, the Spirit, and the church
For this reason, scholars, scientists, and religious leaders have continually studied the universe and the human race
We were uncomplicated and simply followed the older generation, accepting whatever our parents and teachers told us
During the time of Cain and Abel, humanity was not a maze because there had not been any inventions or discoveries
The teachings of Confucius should not be regarded as a religion, because Confucius did not teach people to worship God
Confucius did mention God a few times in his writings, calling Him the King of the heavens, or even the heavens
Christianity, coming out of Judaism and including Catholicism and Protestantism, is a genuine religion, for it has the unique God
The one who made this medicine knows the formula, and he may say to the chemist, 'There is no need for you to study or analyze the medicine
Christ, the very embodiment of God, is the content and reality of the church, and the church is the expression of Christ
All the rest of the teachings in the Scriptures are doctrines related directly or indirectly to this basic revelation
With this insight we can see that every denomination is a legality produced by those who made an issue of a particular discovery
We in the Lord's recovery, however, do not agree with any legality, and we are not making issues of discoveries
If you make an issue of speaking in tongues, this issue will become a legality that controls you and governs you
According to the legality that insists that sisters have long hair, sisters with short hair may not be allowed to come to Christian meetings
Because we have come back to the revelation, in the recovery there is no need for inferences, inventions, or discoveries
From that time onward he was delivered from the religious maze, and he began to travel on the highway of the heavenly vision
Not only the young people, but people of all ages are lost in a maze of human inventions, discoveries, and religions
Nothing is covered, opaque, or veiled, but although everything has been unveiled, we still need the eyes and the light
After this, we may point out that we live in the mingled spirit and that the mingled spirit controls and directs us day by day
If we are in the Lord's recovery, then we are in the vision, but whenever we are out of the vision, we are out of the recovery
When my wife looked out the window, she saw the whole car and said that there must be something wrong with my eye
Before we came into the Lord's recovery, nearly everything was veiled, but when we turned to the Lord's recovery, the veil was removed
We are under the clear sky, the heavenly light is shining, and we are on a highway following the heavenly direction
We do not have to wait to be in the New Jerusalem to have just one way, for in the Lord's recovery today we have the one way
Because we are in the recovery with the one way the one life the one river the one tree the one throne and the one God no one can get lost
When the right hand is properly related to the body it is lovely but when it is detached from the body it becomes grotesque and frightening
No doubt, foot-washing was taught and practiced by the Lord Jesus Himself, for He washed the feet of the disciples as an example for them
Foot-washing is related to the basic revelation, but if you isolate it from the basic revelation, it is like cutting off your feet
When the feet are attached to the body, they are lovable, but when they are detached from it, they are horrible
Paul says that God is the head of Christ, that Christ is the head of the man, and that the man is the head of the woman
To separate head covering from the basic revelation in the Bible is like cutting off your head and handing it to someone
The revelation of the mystery is the unveiling, the opening up, the bringing to light, of God's mystery so that we may see the central focus
Since you care so much for the Bible, why do you not follow a certain matter that is clearly revealed in 1 Corinthians 14?
The focal point of God's revelation is not a matter of whether or not women should be silent in the meeting of the church
Although the word mystery is used in 1 Corinthians, we find nothing there concerning the revelation of the mystery
Romans speaks from our fallen condition but Ephesians speaks from eternity revealing Gods purpose and the desire of Gods heart in eternity
Ephesians 1:4 says, 'Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love'
God selected us in eternity past, before the foundation of the world and the beginning of time, that we might be holy and without blemish
All Bible students realize that holiness refers to God's nature and that righteousness refers to God's activities
Now we need to find out how dusty man can be holy, how man with the nature of dust can be the same as God in His holy nature
Coming as the bread of life, Jesus said, 'I am the bread of life' ; He also said, 'He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me'
It was not because God foreknew that man would become sinful that He determined to rescue us from our sinfulness and to make us perfect
If there is still a foreign substance within us, we still have a blemish; that is, there is a mixture in our being
In Ephesians 1:5 Paul says, 'Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
We have pointed out that in order for us to become holy, we need to be born of God and thereby have the life of God
The day is coming when we shall be able to say, 'He who has seen us has seen God, because we are the sons of God'
Today we are sons of God expressing God, not by our deeds or behavior, but by having His life with His nature within us
Although many Christians today are talking about the Body, they have not seen that the Body depends upon the sons
Without the experience of Romans 8, it is difficult to have the practice of the Body life revealed in Romans 12
The life and nature of a son are within us, but this life and this nature are concealed within our physical body
If we have seen the divine purpose, we shall realize that the Body is God's unique desire and that we must be in it and take care of it
If we have seen the vision of the divine purpose we shall never be distracted misled or isolated by anything no matter how good it may be
Ephesians 1:5 says that God has predestinated 'us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
If you read Ephesians 1 carefully and thoroughly, you will see that the Body is constituted of the sons of God
Apparently we are the Body of Christ actually all the demons know that we are not the Body of Christ but simply a gathering of sons of man
Hallelujah, we have been chosen and predestinated to be sons of God in order to be constituted into the Body of Christ'!
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
If you read Ephesians 4, Romans 12, and 1 Corinthians 12, you will see that in these chapters the Body is for function
The life by which the Body functions is the life of the sons of God, the divine life for the divine expression
Many times we have functioned by the wrong life, not by the life of the sons of God but by the life of the sons of man
It is the second life, the life of the sons of God, that constitutes the Body of Christ, because Christ is the content of this life
Many Christian teachers have spoken a great deal about Romans 8, often pointing out that it is a chapter on the Spirit
From now on, we need to devote more attention to the matter of sonship in Romans 8 than to the matter of the Spirit
It has been wrought into our spirit and even into our attitude, giving us an attitude that expresses the Father
Although we have the sonship in our spirit, we do not yet have very much sonship in our soul, that is, in our mind, emotion, and will
In order to be 'sonized,' we need 'all things,' which include different kinds of brothers, both wild brothers and mild brothers
Even in spiritual things we are still so much in ourselves, but those who speak in a staggering way expose where we are
If we have little sonship, we cannot have very much of the Body life, for the Body life comes out of the sonship
After experiencing the sonship in Romans 8, we can realize that the good pleasure of God's eternal will is to have the Body life
Because the sonship is being wrought into our soul, the book of Philippians says that we can be one both in spirit and in soul
After we have been 'sonized' through the working of all things, the murmurings and the reasonings will be gone
Although not many Christians know this, the demons and evil spirits realize it and would try to keep this matter veiled
In the King James Version this word is translated 'dispensation' , 'fellowship' , 'stewardship' , and 'edifying'
In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus speaks of baptizing people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all for God's dispensation and indicate God's dispensation with His riches
In order for us to be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the three must be one
To be baptized into the Spirit is to be baptized also into the Son , and to be baptized into the Son is to be baptized also into the Father
After the resurrection of Christ, the Son was manifested, the Father was revealed further, and the Spirit became the Spirit of Jesus Christ
After His resurrection, Jesus commanded His disciples to baptize the nations into the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
The phrase the Spirit of Jesus Christ includes both Jesus, the Nazarene, and Christ, God's Messiah, the anointed One
The Spirit is no longer merely the Spirit of God; the Spirit of God now is both the Spirit of Jesus and the Spirit of Christ
Before Jesus was crucified and resurrected, the Spirit of Jesus Christ was not yet, although the Spirit of God was there already
According to the traditional teaching of the Trinity, the Father is separate from the Son, and the Son is separate from the Spirit
Traditional theology speaks of the three Persons of the Godhead but according to the book of Revelation the third is the eyes of the second
Many of those who argue on behalf of the traditional understanding of the Trinity appeal to the Nicene Creed formulated in A
At the time of that council, seven books of the New Testament, including Revelation, were not yet recognized by the church
The fact that this Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ indicates that Jesus and Christ are realized in this Spirit
Since this Man has passed through crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, all these are now included in the Spirit
We need to accept the vision of this Spirit found in the Bible and then pray ourselves into the realization of this Spirit
Because this Spirit is so rich and bountiful, Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Now we have not only the divine Spirit in our spirit but also the mingling of the divine Spirit with our spirit
Humanly speaking, those who live according to the conscience which is part of man's spirit, may be considered the highest type of people
We are even higher than this, for we live not only according to the conscience but according to the mingled spirit
