THE LAND REMAINING TO BE POSSESSED</h2>
<p>Joshua 13:1-7 speaks of the land that remained to be possessed. When Joshua was old, Jehovah said to him, &ldquo;You are old and advanced in age, and very much of the land remains to be possessed&rdquo; (v. 1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Regions of the Land<br />
That Remained to Be Possessed</h2>
<p>The regions of the land that remained to be possessed included that of the Philistines, the Geshurites, the Canaanites, and the Gebalites and all of Lebanon (vv. 2-6a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah&rsquo;s Promise</h2>
<p>In verse 6b we have Jehovah&rsquo;s promise that He would drive out all the inhabitants of the remaining land before the children of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Joshua Being Charged to Allot<br />
the Remaining Land West of the Jordan</h2>
<p>Jehovah charged Joshua to allot the remaining land to Israel as an inheritance as He had commanded him. Jehovah told Joshua to divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh (vv. 6c-7; 14:1-2).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE LAND EAST OF THE JORDAN<br />
ALLOTTED TO THE TWO AND A HALF TRIBES BY MOSES</h2>
<p>The land east of the Jordan had been allotted to the two and a half tribes by Moses (13:8-13, 15-32; 14:3a).</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. NO LAND ALLOTTED TO THE TRIBE OF LEVI</h2>
<p>No land was allotted to the tribe of Levi because the offerings of Jehovah, the God of Israel, were their inheritance (13:14). Verse 33 goes on to say that the God of Israel would be the inheritance of the tribe of Levi. Thus, the children of Israel divided the land as Jehovah had commanded Moses. They gave no portion to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in with their pasture lands for cattle and their substance (14:4-5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE LAND ALLOTTED TO THE TRIBE OF JUDAH</h2>
<p>Joshua 14:6&mdash;15:63 describes the land allotted to the tribe of Judah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Claim of Caleb</h2>
<p>The first matter covered here was the claim of Caleb (14:6-15; 15:13-19). Caleb claimed Hebron with the hill country (14:10-15). His claim was according to the oath of Moses and the promise of Jehovah (14:6-9a; Num. 14:24; 32:12; Deut. 1:36). This land was promised to Caleb because he had fully followed Jehovah his God (Josh. 14:9b). Caleb took possession of the land promised to him by Moses and Jehovah (15:13-15), and then Caleb&rsquo;s son-in-law gained the springs in the region of the land (vv. 16-19).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Extreme Southern Part<br />
of the Good Land</h2>
<p>The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah extended to the border of Edom, to the wilderness of Zin at the south, the extreme southern part of the good land (15:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. One Hundred Twelve Cities<br />
with Their Towns and Villages</h2>
<p>The land allotted to the tribe of Judah included one hundred twelve cities with their towns and villages (vv. 21-62).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Children of Judah<br />
Being Unable to Dispossess the Jebusites</h2>
<p>The children of Judah were unable to dispossess the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who dwelt with the children of Judah in Jerusalem (v. 63).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Joshua, Judges & Ruth &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
