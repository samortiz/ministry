   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 8 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 12:1-6, 8</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the grainfields.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And His disciples became hungry and began to pick ears of grain and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2 But the Pharisees, seeing this, said to Him, Behold, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3 But He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, and those who were with him;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>4 How he entered into the house of God, and they ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, except for the priests only?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>5 Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>6 But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The reason for the rejection of the Lord was the breaking of the Sabbath 12:1-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Pharisees condemned what the Lord's disciples were doing, saying it was not lawful on the Sabbath v. 2 . The Sabbath was ordained so that the Jews would remember the completion of God's creation Gen 2:2 , keep the sign of God's covenant made with them Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>20:12 , and remember God's redemption accomplished for them Deut 5:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, to profane the Sabbath was a serious matter in the eyes of the religious Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But they did not have adequate knowledge of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord's word Matt 12:3-4 implies that He is the real David.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the ancient time David and his followers, when rejected, entered into the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, seemingly breaking the Levitical law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just as David and his followers were not held guilty, so Christ and His disciples should not have been condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, the Lord's word here also implies the dispensational change from the priesthood to the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the ancient time the coming of David changed the dispensation from the age of the priests to the age of the kings, in which the kings were above the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the age of the priests the leader of the people had to listen to the priest Num 27:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in the age of the kings the priest had to submit to the king 1 Sam 2:35-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, what King David did with his followers was not illegal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now the coming of Christ changed the dispensation again, this time from the age of the law to the age of grace, in which Christ is above all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whatever He does is right.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord revealed to the Pharisees that He was greater than the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicated another turn, a type-fulfilling turn from the temple to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the case of David there was a turn from one age to another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this case, a case concerning the priests, there was a turn from the temple to a person who is greater than the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since the priests were guiltless in acting on the Sabbath in the temple, how could the Lord's disciples be guilty in acting on the Sabbath in Him who is greater than the temple?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the first case the king broke the Levitical regulation; in the second case the priests broke the sabbatical regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Scriptures neither was guilty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, scripturally, what the Lord did here was right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 8 the Lord indicated the third turn, a right- asserting change from the Sabbath to the Lord of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the Lord of the Sabbath, He had the right to change the regulations concerning the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, the Lord gave the condemning Pharisees a threefold verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, He could do whatever He liked on the Sabbath, and whatever He did was justified by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was above all rituals and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since He was there, no attention should have been paid to any ritual and regulation.</S>
