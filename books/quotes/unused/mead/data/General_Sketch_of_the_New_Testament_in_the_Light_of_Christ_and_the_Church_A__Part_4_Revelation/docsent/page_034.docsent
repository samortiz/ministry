   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE JUDGMENT OF THE GREAT WHITE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following this, there is the judgment of the great white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 11 and 12 say, And I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened; and another scroll was opened, which is the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And the dead were judged by the things which were written in the scrolls, according to their works.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Him in verse 11 must refer to the Lord Jesus, who is to be the Judge of the living and the dead John 5:22; Acts 10:42; 17:31; 2 Tim 4:1; Rom 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The old heavens and the old earth will flee away from Him; that is, they will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 20:12 speaks of two kinds of scrolls.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first scrolls are a record of the works and deeds of the unbelievers, while the second scroll is the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 13 continues, And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, each of them, according to their works.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the dead who are in the sea are the same as the dead who are in Hades, why is there the need to mention the dead in the sea separately?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This requires much study.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mr. G. H. Pember gave us a clear understanding of this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said that the dead who are in the sea may not be human beings but the spirits the demons today of the living beings of the preadamic age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why demons go into the sea after being cast out of human beings Matt 8:31-32; 12:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the restoration of God s creation, on the second day, God made an expanse to separate the waters below from the waters above Gen 1:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In both places in the air and in the sea there are evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The evil things in the sea are the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Revelation 11:7 and 17:8 tell us that the beast comes out of the abyss, but 13:1 says that he comes up out of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This may indicate that the sea is the mouth of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 20:14 and 15 say, And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the second death, the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And if anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now at the end of Revelation 20 everything is cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the dirt has been thrown into the trash can of the universe, which is the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, 21:1 says that the sea is no more.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sea is a problem to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Genesis 1 the waters on the earth were a problem that God had to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the negative side, God worked to limit the sea, while on the positive side, He worked to bring forth the land in order to grow something for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The good land of Canaan is a further progression of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The land is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the third day Christ resurrected from the death waters, and by His resurrection He brought forth much life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The sea is a place where the enemy of God is, so God must eliminate it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually at the end of the Scriptures there are two consummations, the New Jerusalem on the positive side and the lake of fire on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God produces the New Jerusalem from the land, and He reduces the sea into a lake.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What was originally a large sea is now in a lake, the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may compare this to cleaning a house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At first we may have a big mess, but after we clean it up, the mess is restricted to a small trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, all the dirty and wrong things in the universe will be restricted to a small location, the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The sea will be limited to a lake, but the temple will be enlarged to be a city.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The sea is limited and reduced, while the temple is enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There will be no more sea, nothing dirty or waste.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The beast, the false prophet, the dragon, their followers, the dead in the sea, the dead in Hades, and death and Hades themselves will together be cast into the universal trash can, the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way, everything negative will be cleared up.</S>
