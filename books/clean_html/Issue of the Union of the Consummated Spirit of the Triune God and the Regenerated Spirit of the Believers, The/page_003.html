<P>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for gathering us once again that we may be assembled together in You. We worship You for being the speaking God. You have not ceased speaking and You have been speaking until today. In Your recovery You have already spoken for seventy-four years. We deeply feel that You will continue to speak. Here we are truly under Your gracious visitation. We are thirsty for You; we love You; we seek You; we also pursue You. Within us we definitely have a thirst, which You alone can satisfy. Not only so, Lord, we want to see the mystery in the depth of Your Word. Your Word is both simple and profound. It is so simple that even a little child can understand it. It is so profound that without Your revelation, no one can comprehend it. Hence, Lord, we ask You to give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation, a spirit that can comprehend and penetrate, a spirit that can see and obtain. Lord, may You uphold us. We want not only to be those who pursue You but also to be the God-men whom You desire. We thank You that in our midst You have opened to us the vision of the high peak so that our hearts aspire and pursue, desiring to see what it is to be a God-man and to know how to be a God-man. Lord, this is really a great mystery, a mystery of mysteries. We thank You that in Your Word is the light and the revelation of the depth. Lord, we ask You to have mercy on us all again. Open up and speak to us clearly the secret of Your mystery from the depth of Your Word. Lord, cleanse us. Cleanse our whole being so that we can be clean inside and out. Both our speaking and our listening here need Your precious blood. Lord, our lips, our ears, the eyes of our heart, and our spirit within all need the cleansing of Your precious blood. Amen.</P><P>I have sought much before the Lord for this conference. In the past year, after the Lord released the high peak of the vision, everyone has read those messages and has seen the content of this vision. According to the news I received, the response of the local churches throughout the world is unanimous. Hence, the burden within me has become heavier. After the release of the high peak of this vision, all the saints have responded favorably in the spirit and are desirous to enter into this practice. They ask, "How can we become a God-man?" Many people not only do not know how to become a God-man; they even do not know how God became a man. We all know that our Savior's incarnation was God's becoming a man. This is common to us. However, since this word is from the Bible, its intrinsic significance is profound. Those who study science realize that the crucial points in science are exceedingly mysterious and profound. But those who do not know science do not realize its profoundness. The more one knows a matter, the more he realizes the mystery it contains. In the same way, every point in the Bible is mysterious, and the particular details in each point are inexhaustible. Hence, I have within me the leading from the Lord that after completing the life-study of the entire Bible this year, we still need a "crystallization-study."</P><P>The subject of this conference is "The Issue of the Union of the Consummated Spirit of the Triune God and the Regenerated Spirit of the Believers." Simply speaking, this refers to the issue produced from the fact of the union of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man. The Spirit of God is a mystery; the spirit of man also is a mystery. Hence, the issue produced from the union of these two is the mystery of mysteries. This time we are here to see these three mysteries. Apparently, we understand all these terms; however, intrinsically we may not know them. In the six chapters of this book, although we cannot exhaust these few mysteries, we still hope to lay a foundation and open a door so that we will be able to see and gain something in a far-reaching and deep way.</P><P>In this series of messages my central burden can be expressed in a sentence, that is, "The life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God comes to regenerate, sanctify, renew, and transform the believers, to conform them to the image of the Son of God, and eventually to glorify them with the eternal glory of God that the Son of God may be the Firstborn among His many brothers, the many sons of God; thus, they become the many God-men to constitute the Body of Christ and consummately be enlarged and built up as the New Jerusalem."</P>
