<P>Verse 5 says, "The Lord is near." Please consider this word. Some have said that this refers to the coming of the Lord. But this is not reliable for two reasons: (1) In the phrase "the Lord is near," the word "near" is not an adverb but an adjective; and (2) according to the original text, the word "near" occurs only four times in the New Testament. These include Romans 10:8, Ephesians 2:13 and 17, and Philippians 4:5. The meaning in the fourth instance should be the same as the first three instances. Whatever is referred to in the first three instances should be what is referred to in the fourth instance as well. In the first three instances, "near" refers to location. Therefore, in the fourth instance, it must also refer to location. Romans 10:8 says, "But what does it say? `The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,' that is, the word of the faith which we proclaim." This refers to location. Ephesians 2:13 says, "But now in Christ Jesus you who were once far off have become near in the blood of Christ." This also refers to location. Ephesians 2:17 says, "And coming, He announced peace as the gospel to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near." This also refers to location. Therefore, "the Lord is near" in Philippians 4:5 must also refer to location. This means that the Lord is near to us; it does not mean that the Lord is coming soon. It is wonderful to know that the Lord is near us and can help us. We should rejoice always because He is beside us. We should rejoice because He has drawn near to us.</P><P>Verse 6 says, "In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God." We must rejoice because the Lord is near; we must also not be anxious because He is near. The preceding verse says that we should rejoice, and this verse says that we should be anxious in nothing. Do we realize that other than sin, nothing harms man more than anxiety? Indeed, anxiety is a sin.</P><P>There are many excuses for us to be anxious. There are many good reasons in this world for us to be anxious every day. It is not difficult to find these reasons. We argue that it is unavoidable for us to be anxious when we are faced with these circumstances. But God considers that we have no excuse to be anxious. All the anxieties are without a reason. Therefore, God tells us, "In nothing be anxious." We think the problems of our living, family affairs, and personal difficulties are matters for us to be anxious about. But the Bible says, "In nothing be anxious." Not a single anxiety is legitimate, nor is it allowed by God. Every anxiety is forbidden by Him.</P><P>I read in a book that a pastor once told a woman to be anxious in nothing because it was a sin to be anxious. The woman said that the only thing she was anxious about was her nine sons. The pastor repeated that in nothing should she be anxious. The woman argued that God's word concerning being anxious in nothing did not include such an anxiety. The pastor answered that when God says to be anxious in nothing, He means to be anxious in nothing. The woman insisted that a mother ought to be anxious for her sons. She said, "My anxiety has followed four of my sons to heaven already. Now I still have to be anxious for the other five." Some people think that they should worry about this and about that, as if it is their duty to worry. Others ask, "Should not one be anxious about one or two things in a year?" No. Why? It is because "the Lord is near." Your anxiety indicates that you do not trust in His heart or in His promise. You are shaming the Lord. The Lord is near, but you are anxious; you doubt the power of His hand and the kindness of His heart. The reason you are anxious is because you do not know that the Lord is near.</P><P>Verse 6 continues, "But in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God." How can you be without anxiety? "But"! As long as you follow this "but," everything will be fine. Whether you are sitting, lying down, or walking, you can make everything known to God in three ways: (1) by prayer—ordinary prayer, (2) by petition—definite and specific prayer (through prayer and petition you can tell God the requests in your heart), and (3) with thanksgiving—thanking God for everything. Through giving thanks, you also tell God your needs. You should make known everything to God by prayer, petition, and thanksgiving. But you do not; therefore, you are full of anxiety and short of joy. You have disobeyed God's commandment, and you cannot be free from anxiety.</P><P>It would be wonderful if we would commit the things we encounter into God's hand item by item. Otherwise, when the first thing comes up, we lay it upon ourselves. Then when the second and third things come up, we also lay them upon ourselves. In this way, we are pressed and lose our joy. Once I saw builders moving tiles to the roof of a house. Three men stood on a ladder, one at the top, the second in the middle, and the third at the bottom. The one at the bottom would hand the tiles over to the one in the middle. After the one in the middle received the tiles, he would hand them to the one at the top. They continued this way unceasingly. When I saw this I thought, "What if the man in the middle did not pass on the tiles he received, or what if the man on the top refused to take the tiles passed to him?" If that happened, the one in the middle would eventually be crushed to death by the tiles that were continuously coming to him. We deal with anxiety in this manner. If we do not send all the anxieties to God to let Him bear them, all the anxieties of this world will crush us to death. We must not allow the anxieties of the world to keep pressing upon us; we must place them on God's side. The moment we have anxiety, we must immediately entrust it to the Lord. We do not have to tolerantly accumulate anxieties upon ourselves item by item. There is a way out. The way is, "In everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God." This is something that the world and sinners cannot do. Only Christians can do this because we have the Lord, and the Lord is near. Not only can we pray for great things, but for small things as well. We can pray for everything that we have a reason to be anxious about. Everything which affords an opportunity to worry about can be prayed for. The reason we can be anxious in nothing is not that we are naturally optimistic or that we try to be mindless in everything like foolish ones. Such conduct is indeed foolish. Rather, we can be anxious in nothing because we have One to talk to, One whom we can trust, and One who will be responsible. We can rejoice and be free from anxiety because we have God and because we can entrust all things to God through prayers. Prayer is our way out. God is our way out.</P>
