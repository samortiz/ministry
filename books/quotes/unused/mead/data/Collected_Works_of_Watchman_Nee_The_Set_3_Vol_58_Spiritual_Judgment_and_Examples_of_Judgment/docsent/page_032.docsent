   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 16 Date:July 12, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER W. C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In my youth I heard many Bible stories.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the age of sixteen I began to turn against all religions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1935 I graduated from school and became a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I heard the gospel at Fourth Street in Chefoo through Brother Witness Lee, who preached on the sinful woman in John 8.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God showed me that I was a sinner as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was saved in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After my salvation I consecrated myself to the Lord, daily caring more for the gospel than for my own food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This peak condition did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Soon I returned to my hometown and became cold toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I stopped reading the Bible and praying, and I became the same as an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later the Lord allowed sickness to come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At first I almost became blind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later I vomited blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both my grandfather and father died of tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In my sickness the Lord spoke to me, saying, "Fear not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only believe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nothing is impossible for those who believe."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I lay in bed for sixteen months.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although I was extremely weak physically, to the point that I would fall on my knees when I tried to stand up, I was empowered in my inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1939 I returned to Chefoo, and the Lord gradually recovered my fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord has cleansed me within and without once again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During my time in the church, the Lord would not let go of me in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I began to coordinate with the brothers and sisters to serve the Lord in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am a timid person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Spiritually speaking, I sometimes find it hard to stand upon my feet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Inwardly, I often feel dry and am fearful of hardships along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I once heard Brother Nee as well as Sister Wang say that this way is narrow and hard.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later I went to Brother Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through fellowship I became clear that I should quit my teaching job and give all my time to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1943 there was a great revival in Chefoo, Shangtung, and I consecrated my all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I consecrated not only my possessions but my self and my whole family to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>My great-grandfather once mentioned me by name and consecrated me to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As I recall that incident now, I realize God has honored his consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This time I said, "From now on, I will offer myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I will give up my freedom."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not know what the Lord will do to me in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I know that He has created me and redeemed me, and I should serve Him in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our brother said that at times he could not rise up, that he felt dry within.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I hope that you will ignore these feelings from this point forward.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether or not you can rise up, you should let go of your feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You should only commit yourself to the hand of the Lord, believing that the Lord can accomplish everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He will spontaneously bring you through.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are many problems that we cannot overcome by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, when we look to Him and draw near to Him, the problems go away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a caterpillar walks, it does not consider whether it should move its eighth leg or its tenth leg first.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If it did that, the problem with its mind would become a problem with its walk.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the end it would not be able to walk at all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If it does not think about walking, it will have no problem in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When there is no problem with the mind, there is no problem with the practice, and it walks.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more you try to deal with your inner dryness, burden, and debilitation, the less you will be able to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you consider them a problem, they will become a problem to you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you forget them and let go of them, they will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sometimes we overcome problems by warfare, but sometimes we overcome problems by forgetting them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many things have to be overcome with power and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But sometimes they are overcome by simply forgetting them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we boast in our weaknesses and give up our struggling and our ways, His power will overshadow us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The secret lies in praying for a vision of God's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should see the Lord's glory while we study the Word, pray, or fellowship with the brothers in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once we see this, we will forget our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The inward filling often is related very much to our forgetting, and our forgetting is related very much to touching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once we touch the Lord, we will no longer look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our brother told us that he once vomited blood, but through prayer he was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since he has been on the mountain here, he has vomited blood again.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We pray that the Lord would be merciful to him and heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are three things we should know with regard to healing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>First, we should not tempt God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Second, we should not accept the symptoms of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Third, we should believe in the sufficiency of His grace for us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Timothy had a chronic ulcer, and Paul advised him not to drink water.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At that time the Jews dug water cisterns under their houses and either collected rain water or directed other water into these cisterns.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There was bacteria in the water, and it was not sanitary drinking water.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Paul advised Timothy to take some wine 1 Tim 5:23 , which could warm and invigorate the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul had the gift of healing, and he healed many sick ones.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But he did not heal Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Timothy himself was also gifted, but he could not heal his own ulcer.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God had no word for Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Timothy did not say, "I can drink water, and I can drink wine," because this would be tempting God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Paul said that he could take some wine.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Timothy would not tempt God by drinking the dead water from the muddy cisterns.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Outwardly speaking, there is no difference in the conduct of those who tempt God and those who trust God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The difference lies in the fact that one does not have God's word and the other does.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Outwardly speaking, there is no difference in the conduct of those who walk by God's word and those who walk without God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But if one stands up to walk without having God's word, he is tempting God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If he has God's word, he can ignore all rules of hygiene.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When he does not have God's word, he cannot act contrary to any natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the Gospels, the Lord healed the man with the withered hand because He had spoken to the man.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Once the man had the Lord's word, he did not have to wait for his symptoms to go away; he only needed to believe that he was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He could ignore the symptoms of his sickness, stretch out his hand according to the Lord's word, and be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Lord's word is trustworthy; symptoms are not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The lame man did not need to wait until he became strong to take up his bed and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When the Lord told him to take up his bed, he took up his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we have God's word, we do not have to consider our pulse or our fever.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But if we do not have God's word, we have to abide by the rules of hygiene.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Once we have God's word, we can be extreme; we do not need to be afraid of anything.</S>
