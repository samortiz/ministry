   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE GRADUALLY AND POSITIVELY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25; Matt 16:18; Eph 4:12-16 THE APPLICATION OF THE BIBLICAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE BELIEVERS TO MEET AND TO SERVE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEING GRADUAL ACCORDING TO</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OUR PRESENT SITUATION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The application of the biblical way for the believers to meet and to serve should be gradual according to our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In doing anything you have to take care of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may use a medical doctor to illustrate this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a doctor treats someone, he always proceeds gradually according to the condition of the illness and the real situation of the patient.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You must take care of the situation in your local church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not all the churches today are on the same level in the application of the biblical way to meet and to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some churches have just started; some churches may still be considering how to take this way; and some churches may have gone much further and may be at a higher level.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You need to take the present situation of the church in your locality into a thorough, careful, and fine consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then you will know how the Lord will lead you, and you will know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From the initiation, the beginning, of the biblical way, we should practice only the beginning part.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not present all the points and all the parts of this biblical way at once.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As in a feast, you should put out course after course.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You need to consider what the first and second courses should be, what the last course should be, and how long each course should last.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a fifteen minute feast, one course may take only two or three minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of this depends on the situation of the eaters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some people do not eat so quickly, and they may not be happy with all the courses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all must learn how to consider the situation of the eaters, how they appreciate and receive the courses of the feast, and how well they eat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After a certain period of time, we may practice a further part of the biblical way to meet and to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I cannot tell you what parts should be practiced first in the church in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again, this all depends upon the situation and the condition of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, part by part, we practice the entire biblical way with much patience from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE APPLICATION ALSO BEING POSITIVE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The application of the biblical way to meet and to serve should also be positive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We human beings always tend to be unbalanced, like unturned cakes Hosea 7:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we turn the cake on one side, we tend to leave it there; that side will be burnt while the other side is raw.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to turn the cake quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we practice to be gradual, we must at the same time be positive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be gradual does not mean that we do not go further.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather it means that we go further steadily and positively.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need much exercise, much wisdom, and much grace with patience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all have to learn how to enjoy the Lord as our patience, our wisdom, and our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While practicing the biblical way part by part, we should practice every part positively with much endeavoring to labor, strive, and struggle by the Lord s great power of resurrection that operates in us until we reach the goal in the full recovery of the truth covered in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nothing exhausts our power as much as a situation requiring patience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we need to labor, strive, and struggle by the Lord s great power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During the period of such an endeavoring practice, we should do everything we can to avoid any kind of opinion or dispute.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not have any discrimination in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not say that a certain saint is for the new way and that another saint is not for the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To speak in this way is to create differences among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether a saint is taking the new way or not should not matter to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must go on positively, not making an issue out of any differences among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not look down on those who seemingly do not practice the new way, nor should we uplift those who do practice the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There should be no looking down or lifting up in the church life; all are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is easy for us to push something when we are in it and to oppose something when we are not in it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a bad habit, causing a bad situation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From the beginning, I did not expect that all the attendants of the church meetings would or could practice the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I only expected that one-fourth of the saints would practice this way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You must honor and respect your church for what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not create any differences or build up something according to your own way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This kind of building always becomes a tearing down.</S>
