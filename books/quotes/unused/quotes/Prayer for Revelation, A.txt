In chapter three, he wanted us not only to realize our relationship with the Lord, but also our relationship with the church
In the coming eternity, He will have an inheritance in the saints, an inheritance that is full of the riches of glory
Before the Lord Jesus died He said And this is eternal life that they may know You the only true God and Him whom You have sent Jesus Christ
Paul prayed in his first prayer that God would 'give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him'
Immediately after we believe in the Lord, or a few years after we believe in Him, we cannot say that we do not know something about God
It seems that when we reach an impasse in our reasoning or in our doctrines, we cannot go on without the help of our mind
Many people believe in the Lord Jesus in a way that is like holding a cup full of water; they walk very carefully
One day God gives them a revelation, and they know Him; they begin to have the full knowledge of Him, and they truly see Him
Brothers and sisters, if you truly know Him, the whole world's faith will not help you, and the whole world's unbelief will not shake you
If they feel cold and indifferent, and if they lose their taste for everything, they almost say, 'Where is God?
God has to lead us to the point that we no longer care if we feel cold or hot, indifferent or excited, because we have known God
Although outwardly there may be joy, pain, or other kinds of feelings, no feeling will change us, because we know Him inwardly
Brothers and sisters, only this kind of Christian will stand, and only this kind of Christian will not be shaken
If you have the full knowledge of God even if more questions come you will not have any rock in your heart and nothing will bother you
In other words, not only does God want us to know Him, but He wants us to know what He is doing from eternity to eternity
It is also related to the inheritance which God secures in the saints and to the power which He manifests among them
Let us first consider God's calling and His inheritance, and then we will consider the power which is manifested toward us who believe
Verse 18 says, 'The eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling'
Verse 4 says, 'Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love'
If you have never been weak, and if you have never realized that you have erred, you will not realize how special this calling is
If you know a little about how weak and worthless you are, and how wrong you have been, you will realize the preciousness of this calling
It does not matter how weak and worthless we are today, and it does not matter how many defects and faults we have today
Thank Him that one day He will bring us to the point where we will stand before Him holy and without blemish as He is
Verse 5 says, 'Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
Galatians 4:6 says, 'And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
Hebrews 2:10 says, 'For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory'
Paul prayed that the eyes of our heart would be enlightened to know the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints
We are happy when we see good results from our works, and we are sad when we do not see good results from our works
We cannot hold on to our past views and methods, and we cannot be concerned all the time with our trifling gains and losses
When they turn around to work and preach the gospel, they say, 'I do not know how to relate my work to God's plan
The question therefore lies in whether or not we have seen something, and whether the eyes of our heart have been opened
The commitment of our heart, the burden on our shoulder, and the work in our hands will be nothing less than what God wants to do
Even the moving of a little piece of stone should be toward the building of that one work which spans from eternity to eternity
Whatever work we do must be within that great realm, must be joined to that great goal, and must be a part of that great work
What is He doing to accomplish what He determined to do in eternity past and what He will gain in eternity future?
On the subjective side, he prayed that we would know 'the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe'
They are concerned with their personal victories, their personal holiness, and answers to their personal prayers
It is true that God needs to work on us, and we need personal victories, holiness, power, strength, freedom, and deliverance
God wants us to see a vision and know the goal of His work, and then He wants to work within us to fulfill that goal
In the same way, God has given us power not for our personal spiritual enjoyment only, but for the purpose of reaching His goal
If God's power has not done anything in us, it means that we do not truly know God, and we do not truly know His plan and purpose
The treasure within this earthen vessel is so precious that even we ourselves are not clear how precious it is
The experience may only last a minute, but it takes thirty to forty years for a man to discover what he received during that one minute
Our growth does not depend on how much power we receive from the Lord, but on how much we see concerning the power we received from the Lord
God desires that we see the surpassing greatness of His power toward us through the revelation of the Holy Spirit
The strong ones are not those who have received, and the weak ones are not those who have not received; we have all received
We have to realize that the power which is toward those who believe is according to the operation of the might of His strength
In other words, the power that operates in the church is as great as the might of strength that operated in Christ
The might of strength which God operates in us is as great as the might of strength which He operated in Christ
You should not think that you are all right, just because you have read the book of Ephesians a few times and can memorize 1:19 and 20
If we have not seen that the power in us is the same as the power that is in Christ, we still need to pray for the seeing
We have to admit humbly that there are still many things we have not seen, and that God has to show them to us
Paul said, 'According to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead'
When you see a man dying and you wish that he could live on you will realize at that moment how great the power of death is
The power within a Christian is the resurrection power; it is a power that transcends everything, that puts everything under Christ's feet
We have to ask God to be gracious to us so that we see the Body of Christ, and see that our life is only preserved in the Body
For life to be preserved means that the life within is not disrupted, and the life within others is not disrupted
If a person does not see the church and does not deny himself, there is no way for the surpassing greatness of power to be manifested in him
We do not need God to do more works, but we need to have the revelation concerning the works that He has completed
It is not a matter of wishing Gods plan to be this or that God has arranged everything already and we only need to see what He has arranged
We need a spirit of wisdom to understand His work, and we need a spirit of revelation to know what He has done
It seems as if the eternal plan was damaged by man, but what the fall damaged, resurrection has recovered and brought back
Some have said, 'It would be wonderful if God had made an additional arrangement before the foundation of the world'
Paul was not praying for us to have more of Him, but for us to see the glory, the riches, and the greatness of the things we have received
Many Christians are hoping for this and that, as if God has never done any work on them or given them anything
What is so special about Ephesians 1 is that it shows us that God has done everything; He has left nothing for us to do
We treasure Ephesians 1 very much because it shows that forgiveness, redemption, and the receiving of the Spirit are all accomplished facts
When the Holy Spirit truly opens our eyes and gives us sight, we will immediately say, 'Thank God that it is done'
We need wisdom before we can understand and become clear, and we need revelation before we can see and comprehend
Perhaps we have heard of God's eternal plan many times, and perhaps we have heard about the position of the church in His eternal plan
Revelation makes us a part of the church, and revelation henceforth makes us a useful vessel in the hand of the Lord
We believe that God in heaven today is concerned for His revelation because He has already accomplished all that He wants to accomplish
