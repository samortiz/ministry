<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. CHRIST IN GOD'S ECONOMY</H2><P>We need to see the revelation concerning Christ in God's economy versus the law in man's appreciation in the Psalms. In the previous message, we saw the truth concerning the law in man's appreciation. Now we need to see the divine revelation of Christ in God's economy in Psalm 2 (vv. 2, 6-9, 12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Declaration of God<br>according to His Divine Concept</H2><P>Psalm 2 is a declaration of God according to His divine concept. Psalm 1, however, is according to the natural, human concept. David thought that the one who meditated in the law day and night would prosper in everything. This is according to the human concept of doing something for one's personal benefit and gain. There is no consideration in Psalm 1 for God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Exalting Christ as the Center<br>of the Economy of God</H2><P>Psalm 2 exalts Christ as the center of the economy of God. Although the word economy is not in Psalm 2, the revelation and reality of God's economy are there. In this psalm God declared that He had installed His King (v. 6). For God to have a King is for the fulfilling of His economy. Then God said, "I will give the nations as Your inheritance / And the limits of the earth as Your possession" (v. 8). This is for a kingdom. Of course, the King needs a kingdom, and this kingdom is not small. It is a great kingdom of all the nations, covering the limits of the entire earth. This will be the biggest kingdom in human history. Christ will possess all the continents. His kingdom will be everywhere to include everyone. The King and the kingdom in Psalm 2 show us the economy of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Anointed in His Divinity in Eternity by God<br>to Be the Messiah&#151;Christ&#151;the Anointed One</H2><P>Psalm 2 reveals Christ, the Anointed One (v. 2). Among the Brethren, there was a debate concerning when Christ was anointed. Daniel 9:26 says that Messiah would be cut off, crucified. Messiah is a Hebrew word, and the Greek equivalent is Christ. They both mean the Anointed One. Daniel 9:26 shows that before Christ was incarnated and crucified, He was already the Anointed One. Therefore, Christ was anointed in His divinity in eternity by God to be the Messiah&#151;Christ&#151;the Anointed One. This is also based upon John 1:41, where the Lord's disciple Andrew told Simon, his brother, that he had found the Messiah, the Anointed One. This indicates that Christ was anointed in eternity in His divinity before His incarnation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Anointed in His Humanity in Time<br>at His Baptism</H2><P>He came as the Anointed One to accomplish God's eternal plan. He became a man and He was anointed again in His humanity in time at the time of His baptism (Matt. 3:16-17; Luke 4:18-19; Heb. 1:9; Acts 10:38).</P>
