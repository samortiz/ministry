   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S DEATH BEING FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HIS RESURRECTION BEING FOR US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, there are these two sides in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without the death of the Lord Jesus for us, we would not have been redeemed from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible says that Jesus has died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we see that we are still in sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although God has finished His side of the work, matters are still unsettled on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is why the Lord Jesus must resurrect before we know that our sins have been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Death is for God, and resurrection is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Death is God's demand, and resurrection is the sinners' demand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Death is the solution of sin before God, and resurrection is the removal of doubt in man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With death, the record of sin is done away with.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With resurrection, we realize the proof of forgiveness and a not guilty verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank the Lord that there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What happens when one comes to God and wonders if he is saved or not?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a one may indeed have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But he may still wonder if he is really saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now before God, the receipt has been issued already.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If such a one still wants to doubt, it is because he chooses to doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Lord Jesus has resurrected, then our problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please make a point to remember these three passages Romans 4:25, 10:9, and 1 Corinthians 15:17.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These three places show us what resurrection has accomplished for us objectively.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Up until now, we have seen quite a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have covered sin, the law, grace, God's righteousness, the work accomplished by the death of the Lord Jesus, and the work accomplished by His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A brother has asked the question: What does 1 John 2:2 mean?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I would answer in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The words "the sins of" in the phrase "the sins of the whole world" in some versions are not in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Chinese Union Version reads, "And He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If such is indeed the case, then the whole world would have been saved already, for the Lord Jesus has become a propitiation for the sins of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in Greek it should read, "And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the whole world."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For a reader of the New Testament to understand the Lord's redemption and His substitution, he first has to know the distinction between ourselves and our sins, that is, between the sinner and the sins of the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, he has to know the difference between all and many.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, he must know the difference between sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are differences between the three pairs of things: ourselves and our sins, the all and the many, and sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible says many times that the Lord Jesus died for all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But not once does it say that the Lord Jesus died for the sins of all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second Corinthians 5:14 says that, "One died for all, therefore all died."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul could not say that since One died for the sins of all, therefore all died.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus died for all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But He did not die for the sins of all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the Lord Jesus had died for the sins of all, then whether or not one believes, he can be saved, for all the problems of sins are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the Lord Jesus died for all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we go to Him, we will receive Him as our substitute and receive His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible does say that the Lord Jesus died for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in such cases, it says that He died for the sins of many, and not for the sins of all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The night before last, a brother tested me with a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He asked why the book of Hebrews says that the Lord Jesus was offered up for our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hebrews 9:28 says, "So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You can see that when it talks about Christ's bearing of sins, it says "to bear the sins of many," and not "to bear the sins of all."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Following this, it gives an explanation, "to those who eagerly await Him."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means all those who are purchased by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is the innumerable multitude in Revelation 7:9-17.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is the many.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That is why it can say that He was offered up for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But it cannot say that He was offered up for the sins of all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The wording of the Bible is never loose.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If Christ bore the sins of all, if He bore all the sins of everyone in the world, then we would not have to preach the gospel anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What we have is the many.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, Matthew 26:28 records that when the Lord Jesus took the cup, He said, "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Again we have "many," and not "all."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If it were "all," then everyone's sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible only says that the Lord Jesus died for all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This word merely shows us that the Lord's death is an open one and that everyone can receive the benefit of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If there is anyone here who is not saved tonight, I would say that Christ has died for you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But as for me, the Lord Jesus died for my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As long as you ask for it, the effectiveness of the Lord's death will be upon you, and you will have a share in it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But you must come to Him before the effectiveness of the Lord's death can be yours and can work on you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus died for all, and He died for the sins of many.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is a distinction between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have to take note of this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Let us read two more passages.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Romans 5:18-19 says, "So then as it was through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also it was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For just as through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we want to understand these two verses, we must give them some thought and pay attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Readers of the Bible agree that these two verses are some of the most difficult verses in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to pay attention to the wording of them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>First, in verse 18, it says, "all men," but in verse 19, it says, "the many."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Second, in verse 18 there is the Greek word eis, which is equivalent to the English word to or toward.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>One version translated this as "by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is not a very accurate translation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The verse can be translated here as "through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also it was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now we have to pay a little closer attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Verse 18 speaks about one offense, and verse 19 speaks about one man.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The one offense denotes the sin of Adam Rom 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The one-time sin of Adam was unto the condemnation of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This means that the one offense was for the condemnation of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Have you seen that just once was enough?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is like saying that once a person makes a fortune, he is prepared to buy many things.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The one offense was for the condemnation of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the same way, the one righteous act of Christ was for the justification unto life to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is not correct to translate the verse as the previously mentioned version does, for it would mean that through the one righteous act of Christ, all would have been justified and received life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What is the meaning of eis, translated "unto" in this verse?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It means a preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is like the government's printing of many bank notes in the central bank.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is a preparation to be used later for exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Even if everyone comes to exchange the notes, the government is prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Verse 18 says all men.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This means that everyone can receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>There is no problem here at all.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But verse 19 is different.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Here it says, "For just as through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Here we have the many.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Through the disobedience of one man, who is Adam, the many were constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Here it does not say that all men were constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Why is this so?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Let me give you an honest testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It may seem as if I am joking.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But six years ago, when I first read about the difference between the many and the all, I was a little concerned for the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>While I was looking up the original text, I thought if Paul were to use words the way our translators did, it would be a disaster.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I was almost praying there, "Don't let such a word be all but be many."</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Eventually I found out that it is indeed many.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>What does it mean if we say that through the disobedience of one all men were condemned?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This would mean that everyone who is in Adam is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>There would not be one righteous one.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This would not be too serious.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>But the next sentence would be more serious: Through one righteous act all men are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This would mean that the gospel need not be preached anymore, for everyone is saved and is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>There is no mention here of the matter of believing or not and receiving or not.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Through the obedience of the One all are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Even the unbelieving ones are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>But this is, of course, not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>What it says here is, "Through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Therefore, what the work of the Lord Jesus has gained is for the many.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>One must differentiate between all and the many.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>At the same time, we must also differentiate between ourselves and our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Romans 5:8 says, "While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>But 1 Corinthians 15:3 says that "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures."</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>To be "for us" is a preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>But to be "for our sins" is a kind of realization.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Even if a person is not yet saved, he can still preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>But he can only say that God sent His Son to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>This is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>But only those who have been saved can say that God sent His Son to die for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>This is because our relationship with the Lord Jesus is in the matter of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Hence, we can say that the Lord Jesus died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>First Peter 2:24 says, "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree."</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>There is a distinction here.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>To a sinner, we can only say that the Lord Jesus died for him.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We cannot say that the Lord Jesus died for his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>It will help you to understand if I illustrate this by a simple example.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Suppose I have borrowed some money, but have no way to repay.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>A brother knows that my account number in the Shanghai Bank is No. 51.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Suppose he deposits a sum of money into account No. 51.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Then he writes a letter to me telling me that he has deposited a sum of money in the bank for me and that I can now repay my debt.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>He has paid the money and has sacrificed himself to prepare the money for me.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>But let me ask, Has my debt been cleared yet?</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>I can pay back the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>The money is in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>But the debt is not paid yet.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>It is only when I go personally to the bank and withdraw the money and pay back the debt that I can say that this brother has paid the debt for me.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>In the same way, the Lord Jesus has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>This death was prepared for us.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>But it is only when we receive the Lord Jesus that we can say that He died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Hence, brother, when you quote 1 John 2:2, you must be careful about the wording.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Jesus Christ has become a propitiation for our sins, and not for us only, but also for the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>You can see how accurate the Holy Spirit is in choosing the words through His apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>The Lord Jesus died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>But the death of the Lord Jesus was not only for us, but for the whole world, so that the whole world may receive this death.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>One has to be careful here.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Do not add the words the sins of to "the whole world."</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>It is unfortunate that many have not seen this.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>We cannot add anything to the word of God, nor can we subtract anything from it Rev 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Finally, there is still one thing that we have to take note of.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>It is the difference between sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>We cannot say that the Lord Jesus died for the sins of the whole world, for sins means all the wrongdoings and all the punishment that we need to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>If the Lord Jesus died for the sins of the whole world, then all the wrongdoings of all the world were removed.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>Whether a man believes or not, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>But the Bible is very careful in the use of words.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>It only says the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>It does not say the sins of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>The word "sin" is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>The problem of sin is brought into the world through one man and brought out of the world through one man.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>What is mentioned here is the "abstract" dealing of the problem of sin by the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>Objectively speaking, sin entered the world in an "abstract" way through Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>Today the Lord Jesus is taking away and dealing with the problem of sin in an "abstract" way.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>This does not mean that He has borne the guilt of each individual sin.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>If He has borne the guilt of each individual wrongdoing, then the whole world would have been saved already.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>Thank and praise the Lord that the Word of God does not have any loophole.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>It never makes a mistake.</S>
