<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Our Spirit Mingled with the Spirit of God</H2><P>We worship the Father in our spirit mingled with the Spirit of God (John 4:23-24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. By Being Born of the Spirit of God in Our Spirit</H2><P>If we are going to worship God in our spirit, we must be born of the Spirit of God in our spirit (John 3:5, 6b). In John 3 there is the need to be born again, and in John 4 there is the worship in spirit. First, we need to be born of the Spirit, and then we can worship in spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. By Being Baptized into One Body<br>in the Spirit of God</H2><P>By being baptized into one Body in the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 12:13a), we can worship the Father in our spirit. Actually, our worship in the dispensing of God is not an individual matter. According to the type in the Old Testament, all the children of Israel came to Jerusalem to worship, not in an individual way but in a corporate way. Their worship was corporate worship. At every feast, three times a year, they came together to worship God. Therefore, the worship in the dispensing of God according to the economy of God is a corporate worship in the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. By Drinking of the Spirit of God</H2><P>We also worship in our spirit by drinking of the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 12:13b; John 4:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. By Being in the Unique Place of Worship<br>Where God's Habitation Is</H2><P>We must worship the Father by being in the unique place of worship where God's habitation is (Deut. 12:5; Eph. 2:22). After we are born of the Spirit of God in our spirit, baptized into one Body in the one Spirit, and drink of this one Spirit, our spirit becomes the unique place of worship because our spirit is the very place where God's habitation is. Christians are divided today because they will not come to their spirit to worship. If all the Christians would come to their spirit to worship, there would be no division. As long as all the children of Israel came to Jerusalem to worship, they were kept in oneness. The principle is the same today. Many Christians will not come to their regenerated spirit to worship God, so they are divided. Today we have to worship the Father in our spirit mingled with the Spirit of God.</P>
