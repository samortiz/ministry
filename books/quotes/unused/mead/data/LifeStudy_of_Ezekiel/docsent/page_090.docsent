   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS OF THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we prove from the record in the book of Ezekiel that God, man, and all the creatures died on the altar, on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can we prove that the death of Christ was such an all-inclusive death?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can we prove that the cross gives us God?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All this is proved by the design and measurements of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The clear details of the altar are a special characteristic of Ezekiel s vision.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The earlier books of the Bible do not speak specifically about the measurements of the altar in such a particular way, but Ezekiel gives us details concerning the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we consider figure 3 altar detail , we will see that according to Ezekiel s vision the altar has four sections: the base, the lesser ledge, the greater ledge upon the lesser ledge, and the upper altar upon the greater ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The upper altar is called the hearth of God, the place where something burns for God and by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us now briefly consider the measurements.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The base of the altar is one cubit high.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The number one signifies the unique God; thus, the base of the altar being one cubit high indicates that God is the base of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that the cross was initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The lesser ledge, which is upon the base of the altar, is two cubits high.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here the number two signifies not only a testimony but also the second person of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the second person of the Triune God as a witness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The third section, the greater ledge, is four cubits high, signifying the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The upper altar on top of the greater ledge is also four cubits high.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The top of the altar is a square, twelve by twelve cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The number twelve is composed either of six times two or of three times four.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this case all these numbers are involved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The number four signifying the creature, the number six signifying man, and the number three signifying the Triune God are all here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From all this we can see that God is here, that Christ is here, and that all creatures, including man, are here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God as the base includes Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Christ died upon the cross, God, man, and all the creatures died there with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, this altar signifies the all-inclusive death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the death of Christ is mysterious, there are many different opinions concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>An unbelieving Jew might say simply that a man named Jesus, the Nazarene, died there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many of today s believers would say that the One who died on the cross was their Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Other Christians, who are more advanced in their spiritual understanding, might say that Christ their Redeemer and they themselves died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, I would declare that not only Christ, my Redeemer, and I died there, but also all the creatures and God Himself died there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The whole universe with the Creator has passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because everything has passed through death, everything could be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever could be terminated by death was terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, only God was able to pass through the test of death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We and the entire creation were terminated, but God was able to pass through the test of death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The all-inclusive death of Christ worked out a mingling which brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In that death God died in man to be released, and man died in God to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praise the Lord that in the wonderful, all-inclusive death of Christ, God died in man, and man died in God!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hallelujah for Christ s releasing and terminating death!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In His death we were terminated, and God was released.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE HEARTH</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The top of the altar, the hearth of God, is twelve cubits square.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the fireplace of God, the place of God to burn things for God, to God, and by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is significant that the hearth measures twelve cubits by twelve cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the first time the number twelve is used in the temple measurements.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The number twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem and is composed of three times four.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The number three is the number of the Triune God, and the number four is the number of man as a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The number twelve, therefore, signifies the Triune God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The New Jerusalem will be the consummate mingling of the Triune God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church life today is also the mingling of the Triune God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE GREATER LEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The greater ledge, the section which is directly under the upper altar, has an edge on either side which measures one cubit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why the greater ledge is fourteen cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The number fourteen is composed in two ways: seven times two and ten plus four.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Seven is the number of completion, two is the number of testimony, ten is the number of fullness in perfection, and four, of course, is the number of the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By putting all these numbers together, we can realize that this signifies that the creature in fullness bears a complete testimony.</S>
