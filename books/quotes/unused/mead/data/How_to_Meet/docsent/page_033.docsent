   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PSALM 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Most of us are familiar with this Psalm, but in order to help us realize its message I must refer to the previous Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Psalms 3 through 7, we see how sad was the situation of the Psalmist.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But suddenly in Psalm 8 the Spirit came in with this: O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What a change!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we spend much time reading the newspapers, we will say, How long!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How long!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if we turn to the spirit, we will say, How excellent is Thy name in all the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We will not care for man; we will not care for the wars; we will not care for all the riots and disturbances.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We will only say, Hallelujah, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now note how the Psalmist continues: You have set your glory above the heavens, but You have ordained strength out of the mouth of little ones on this earth to silence all the enemies our paraphrase .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the previous Psalms the Psalmist prayed that the Lord would deal with all the adversaries, all the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Psalms the adversaries refer to the opposing ones among the Lord s people: for example, in the time of David, Absalom, David s own son, was an adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The enemies are the foes from without, like the heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The adversaries are within and the enemies are without, and when they come against you, there is no need for you to smite them; just say, O Lord, how excellent is Thy name!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Your praising will silence them; your praising will frighten them away; your praising is the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second verse of Psalm 8 has these two meanings: out of the mouth of the babes, the little ones, the unweaned ones, God could 1 establish strength and 2 establish praise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the strength?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The praise is the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The praise silences the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may say that you are weak as David said in Psalm 6:2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But even if you are a babe, even if you are a suckling, the weakest of the weak, God can establish from you the strength that will smite the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But you must open your mouth to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you simply praise Him, God will establish strength out of your mouth stronger than an army.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hallelujah, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regardless of how weak you are, regardless of how weak I am, regardless of how weak we all are, if we will open our mouths and say, O Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth, God will establish the strength to shut the mouths of all the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In what way?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Just by praising Him the power will break forth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am the same as many of you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In my youth I attended Christian meetings continually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I liked to hear messages, especially those from the mouths of famous speakers and spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But, I tell you, simply doing this did not work so well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Could we not come to the meetings without a message, without a sermon, but just praising and singing?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Have you ever seen the power released from the praises out of the mouths of babes and sucklings?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you trust in the praising as much as in the message?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let us come back to the Word, back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Pharisees spoke with the Lord Jesus concerning marriage and divorce, the Lord Jesus told them, From the beginning it was not so Matt 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all must go back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the beginning of the church in the early days, it was not as it is today with teaching upon teaching, message upon message, sermon upon sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was not so in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the last verse of Acts chapter two it says that the church, the local church, was praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was a praising church, not a sermon-listening church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>PSALM 48</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This Psalm says, Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot tell how great He is, but we must greatly praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our praise must match His greatness; we must have greatness in our praising.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I say again, we must all forget our background.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to 1 Corinthians 14:26 the primary thing we must do is to sing a psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Singing and praising must be the first thing in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then what about the matter of noise?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some may not agree with the matter of making noise and consider it a kind of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But in the Psalms, it is said seven times, Make a joyful noise unto God 66:1; 81:1; 95:1, 2; 98:4, 6; 100:1 , and one time, Make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise 98:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible says, Make a joyful noise unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Another version says, Make a joyous shout unto God not only a joyful noise, but a joyous shout.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must drop our backgrounds, and come to the meetings in the spirit and make a joyful noise to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all know the story of how Paul and Silas sang praises to God at midnight in the prison.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Their praising caused an earthquake which released all the prisoners and eventually brought the jail keeper and his family to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do you see the power and strength of praising?</S>
