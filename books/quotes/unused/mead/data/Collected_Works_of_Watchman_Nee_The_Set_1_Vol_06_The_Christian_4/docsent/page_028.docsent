   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE SEVEN THE PATHS TO HELL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>13, 14 FIVE WAYS TO GO TO HELL</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us first read a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse is the word of Jesus Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it" Matt 7:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here, this seems to show us a place called "destruction."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a wide gate to enter this place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Beyond the gate, there is a broad way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the way, countless people are running toward that place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They behave as though they are on an express train.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the way is broad, it is easy to walk on it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since the gate is wide, everything can be brought through it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But this way and gate lead to the place of destruction!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The meaning of destruction is perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The place of destruction is the place of perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The place of perdition is hell.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus states that the gate of hell is wide and the way to hell is broad, and many are those who go down to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is possible that you are one of them!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Listen!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not think that hell has no gate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is a gate to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not think that there is no way to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way to hell is broader than any highway or street in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are many ways to hell; there is not just one way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a man wants to go to hell, there are many ways that he can take.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although there are many ways, there is only one destination.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the starting point may be different, the destination of each way is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although the ways may come from different directions, they all merge in one direction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the people taking a way may be different, their end, hell, is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the way you take may be different from that of another, the place you and the others are going to is the same!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No matter which way you take, it is dangerous if the way leads toward hell.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today there are at least a thousand people sitting here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Editor's note: This message was a sermon given at a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I do not know what you are thinking about.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I could never guess the thoughts in your minds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in observing your daily walk and your attitude towards the Lord Jesus Christ, I reckon that all of you want to go to hell, want to perish, and want to go into perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You want to go into eternal pain and darkness, with the gnashing of teeth and with Satan in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If this were not true, your conduct would not be so unseemly, and you would not be so cold toward the Lord Jesus and toward His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why I believe you want to go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps you have already made up your mind to go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you realize that the Bible mentions quite a number of ways to go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today I will tell you about five ways to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who want to go to hell can practice accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I can guarantee them that they will surely end up in hell!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This will serve to tell those who do not want to go to hell about the way to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Oh, how I wish that you would not have to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if you really do want to go to hell, who can change you?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The First Way to Hell:</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suicide</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suicide is a quick way to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no way to hell faster than suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let us read a verse: "Judas turned aside to go to his own place" Acts 1:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Judas never believed in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although he pretended to be the Lord's disciple outwardly, he was in fact a son of perdition; he had never received salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When he died, he went to his own place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What is his own place?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is the place of perdition and destruction, hell.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When Judas died, he went to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In what way did he go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He committed suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He hung himself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you want to go to hell, suicide is a convenient way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A razor blade, a rope, or a glass of poison can send your soul to the place of eternal suffering quickly!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hell should be far away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You may have to spend a few years or decades before you can go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet if you commit suicide, you will shorten your life on earth and hasten your approach to the place of eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once an unbelieving master asked a believing chauffeur what was the fastest way to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At that time the car was cruising along the highway.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The chauffeur opened the door of the car and told his master, "If you jump out now, you will be there right away."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you have not believed in the Lord, your fall and death will bring you right to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Indeed, the easiest way for a man to go to hell is to kill himself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you want to go to hell in a few hours, just buy a big dose of opium and swallow it, and you will surely arrive at your destination.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you want to go to hell in a few minutes, just take a dose of arsenic, and you will arrive at your destination also.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you think that this is too slow, and you want to go to hell in one minute, you can take a pistol and shoot yourself in the head.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You will surely go to hell this way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There are other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You can starve yourself to death.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You can jump into the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You can lie on the railroad tracks and let a train cut you in half.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Those who commit suicide will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, those who want to go to hell can commit suicide.</S>
