   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul was an apostle with a very deep spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In his second epistle to the Corinthians he said, "But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you...but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance" 10:13, 15b .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This word, though ordinary, is spoken from much experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul said that he would not reach for a place beyond what God had measured to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul would not go to any place that God had not measured to him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He recognized that it was his responsibility to go only to the places that God wanted him to be responsible for.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He would not go to any place that God had not asked him to be responsible for.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today if every worker would be this way, how could there be any of the numerous divisions and sects in the church!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every worker has a specific work which God measures to him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every believer has a pathway upon which God wants him to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are standing in your rightful position, working in your rightful service, and walking on your rightful pathway, that is the highest glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We work, not because we reckon that the work is good or that it can save and help people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, we evaluate our work by considering whether or not our position is one that is ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A big pillar in a house is crucial, but a little iron nail is nevertheless indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the church, if everybody is a great revivalist, evangelist, and leader, how can the church have a healthy standing?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The way we ought to take is a narrow way according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not plan to accomplish great things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We just stay in the position arranged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God wants me to work quietly on small matters only, I am willing to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God does not need to use those with great talent; He uses those who let Him use them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May we be willing to remain in the position God ordains for us and stand where he wants us to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All desire for change, high hope, and great ambition is worldly, soulish, and fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must guard ourselves against all these.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul said, "That I may finish my course" Acts 20:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is this course?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A few months ago I read a biography of Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first chapter of this biography was written by her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She passed away before the whole book was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She said the following words,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a "course" prepared for every believer at the time of his regeneration for the purpose of bringing the new life he has just received to its full maturity, and for the purpose of making his life useful to God to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The responsibility of every believer is to seek out this "course" and walk therein.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Others cannot determine and say what this course is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only God knows and only God can make man know; only He can lead the believers into this course.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today the situation is the same as in the past when He led Jeremiah and the other prophets, and Paul, Philip, and other apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The most glorious thing in a man's life is that he would do the things that God wants him to do on the very ground that God has set for him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For every believer, there is a pathway predetermined by God for him to walk on.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God only uses men chosen by Him to do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He does not want those who enlist and volunteer to do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who are chosen by God have absolutely no freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they try to be free and go their own way, they will only stumble and suffer more.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If God never uses you, that is the end of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if He does, even if you want to run away, you will not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You can flee to Tarshish, but a wind will turn you over into the sea and a great fish will bring you back Jonah 1 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may run away, but you will never escape.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's workers have no freedom from the beginning to the end. Today many believers zealously work, but there are few who do what God measures to them and take the way that God ordains for them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Moses was leading the people of Israel through the wilderness, God instructed that no work should be done on the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But some reported to Moses that they found a man gathering sticks outside the camp on the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moses did not make any decision on his own concerning this man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He seemingly said, "God has not declared anything and I do not know how to handle this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let me go to inquire of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later he went to ask God, and God told him to stone to death the man who trespassed against the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So they stoned him to death Num 15:32-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Moses waited for God to instruct him on what to do before he dared to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are not willing to wait a little, God's work will suffer a great loss!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How hasty is our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We always consider that God is too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot patiently follow God step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Anything we perceive as good we hastily do.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Wherever we detect a lack, we immediately try to supplement it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We assume that if we wait for everything, we will not be able to do anything in our whole lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We forget that the workers who are blessed are those who can wait before God and obey His instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today we bear a heavy responsibility; we must be crystal clear about God's instructions before we start working.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Before we receive God's command, we must do absolutely nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God's command is an expression of God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we want to be a useful vessel in His hands, we must secure God's command before acting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do anything which God has not commanded, we cannot please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When a certain work is put before us, we must first ask: Will this go along with God's desire?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Can it gain His heart?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May we seek to be compatible only with God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should engage ourselves in a spiritual work because we seek after God's desire, not because it is a good work or because the circumstance needs our help.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we desire to be useful in God's hands, we must walk according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The pattern in the mountain cannot be changed at will; we must work according to that pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Are we going to say that this is our work and that we need not go by God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Or are we going to say that this is God's work and that we will go by His will?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All things considered, we cannot but lament that God's work has been ruined in man's hands!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I will frankly say that if our wisdom has never passed through judgment and our thoughts have not been put to death, we cannot work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May God bring us to a stage where there is no self, so that we will have no thought of our own, but will only have God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Every time we work, we must first know if it is God's will or not.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we know for certain that this is God's will, then we should be encouraged to proceed according to the pattern He has shown us.</S>
