   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE TWELVE TALKS ON FAITH Issue No. 22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Works without faith are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the same way, faith without works is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is true in the case of the salvation of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is also true in the case of the believers' living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our attention today is focused on the Christians' works of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The unique place where faith is expressed is in their works.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we do expresses what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our faith and works do not agree with each other, there must be something wrong with our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many believers do not know how to believe and express their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, the matter is quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Faith is expressed through works.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Faith worked together with his works, and by these works faith was perfected" James 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose a believer merely professes with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"What is the profit...if anyone says he has faith but does not have works?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Can that faith save him?" v. 14 . According to the biblical teaching here, if we believe God in a certain matter, we should have a work of faith in that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Otherwise, our faith will not help us receive God's deliverance in that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Two meanings are implied: 1 our work proves our faith, and 2 our work perfects or completes our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there is faith, there must be works that correspond with the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a man believes that a house is on fire, he will surely not sit still in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he sits still there, he does not believe that the house is on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we commit a matter to the Lord and believe that God will work for us, our attitude toward the matter will surely see a great change.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a man says that he believes that God will work for him, yet busily makes plans himself, being worried and distressed, his faith must be false.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"For we who have believed enter into the rest" Heb 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Faith and rest cannot be separated from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we truly believe, our heart will be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If our hearts are restless and uneasy, if we are afraid of this and that, and if we are fearful and feeling lost, struggling with all our effort to scheme, plan, resolve, plead, ask for help, and maneuver, then this shows that we have not yet believed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When one believes, he is at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, when a person believes, he will no longer worry or busily plan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, he will be like a weaned child resting in his mother's bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There must be works to our faith, and the first step of our work of faith is to stop our own works and rest in God's love, wisdom, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of rest is very real, genuine, and natural.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a pretentious calm, unnatural self-restraint, or acting as if nothing has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Faith brings in restfulness because of the knowledge that God is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"If God is for us, who can be against us?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rom 8:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, there is the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In addition, we know our own emptiness and that nothing can be accomplished through our designs and laborious schemes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Faith does not rest in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is the place where faith rests.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only those who have such rest have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who do not have such rest do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Anything that comes by force is not faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Faith is something that comes spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we see a person, we know he is there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do we have to contrive to think he is there?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do we have to force ourselves to believe he is there?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do we have to reason and research before we can acknowledge the reality of this fact?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Within a second we believe spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no need for us to struggle to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the way with all kinds of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The origin of faith comes from God; it causes our spiritual eyes to discern the reality of a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we see and know certain things, spontaneously we believe in them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Faith results in rest, and rest comes not from prediction but from foreknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We exercise faith in restfulness and we rest in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Faith is something very spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Anything that is not spontaneous is not faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Of course, there are counterfeits for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is the possibility of a counterfeit for every spiritual experience of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If believers are not careful, they will be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is no exception to this in the matter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many times Satan will deceive the believers, causing them to have false peace and believe in themselves, which is where the problem really lies.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They can be convinced that God is going to do certain works.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When God does not work, their doubts multiply and they stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The believers must realize that true faith is given by God and is for the accomplishment of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every time God gives us faith, He gives evidence for the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is not a matter of what we think or how we feel, but a matter of what God has said.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes He speaks to us through the holy Word, reveals His view concerning a certain matter, and gives a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Faith comes from such a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Sometimes He works in our spirit, reveals His will, and gives us His promises in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Spontaneously, we receive the faith that He has given.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The faith that God gives cannot be separated from His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, this does not refer to all the promises of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is a matter of whether or not God has given you a particular promise.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Nor does this refer to all the sensations in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Rather, it refers to the promises in which the revelation in our spirit does not contradict the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only the biblical promises that God speaks to us in our spiritual sensations are real.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only the faith that comes out of these promises is reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All true faith depends not on what we think, but on what God has said.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We said all of this to show that our works should prove our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now we will consider the meaning of our works completing our faith.</S>
