   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Man's Repentance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Perhaps someone will ask, "Does a sinner not have to repent before he believes in God and is saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let me tell you: do not reverse the order in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people think, "I must have one basic act of righteousness and one basic act of goodness before God can look favorably on me."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That is law; it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Can you tell someone who feels cold to warm up a little before he comes to the fire?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or would you say, "You will be warm after coming to the fire?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One does not stop his sin and then come to believe; rather, one believes and then does not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mephibosheth was afraid at first, but after being treated gracefully by David, he started to know himself, saying, "What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?" v. 8 . Romans 2:4 says, "Or...not knowing that God's kindness is leading you to repentance?" After knowing God's love, spontaneously one repents.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Mephibosheth came, he wanted to go back to the land without grass; after tasting grace, he prostrated himself on the ground and repented.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Mephibosheth was wrong, so he needed to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>David was not wrong, so he did not need to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to repent, not God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before Mephibosheth knew of David's love to him, David already loved him; after Mephibosheth knew of his love, David still loved him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is the same toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After I knew God's love, I changed my thinking and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today, is there any sinner who would say, "Would not it be good if I could please God?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let me tell you: God loves you just the way you are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Come to God just as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wants you just the way you are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Two Feet under the Table</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now someone may say, "That is right; we are saved by grace and not by works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God treats me in the same way that David treated Mephibosheth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after I am saved, should not my behavior become better?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why do I still feel that I am sometimes high and sometimes low, at times good and at times bad?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to answer this question, please read 2 Samuel 9:13.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were saved by grace initially, and we are also kept in this salvation by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many mistakenly have a concept that they were initially saved by grace but they are kept in this salvation by work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, there is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should realize that the condition for salvation is the condition for preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are saved by Jesus, and we are kept by Jesus to the end. Although Mephibosheth dined with the king often, his two feet still remained lame.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If one foot is lame, one can still jump.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if both feet are lame, it is not only inconvenient, but also ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can dine at the king's table, and both feet can still be lame.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The king would not allow a lame person to dine at his table on the first day and then drive him out after a few days because his feet were still lame.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our two feet are lame, but they are under the table.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should just eat what is on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why do we put our two feet, which should be under the table, onto the table?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should just pay attention to what is on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What God has spread out here is wonderful, rich, and sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We just need to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, we should look at the riches God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every time we look at ourselves, we will not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our eyes are for looking outside not inside.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Self-introspection is not our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we keep our eyes upon the Lord, we will go from glory to glory and be transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we look at ourselves, we will be just like Mephibosheth with two feet lame.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After we are saved, we receive a new life, and the Holy Spirit lives within us; we become entirely new.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The self that comes from Adam never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How did a man as holy as St. Augustine feel when he was dying? He said, "Most of this world's seeds of sin are within my self." As long as we are still in this body, our two feet are still lame.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should only look at the riches and the grace that God has spread before us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we do this, our hearts will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>MEPHIBOSHETH TO DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>2 SAMUEL 16:1-4; 19:24-30</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A few years later, Absalom, the son of David, rebelled, and David escaped to hide from his son Absalom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And the king said, And where is thy master's son?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth" 16:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Is this true?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Let us read chapter nineteen and find out.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After the conspiracy, David came back to Jerusalem, and Mephibosheth, the grandson of Saul, also came down to meet the king.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From the day the king departed until he came again in peace, Mephibosheth did not do three things: he "had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes" v. 24 . Brothers and sisters, do you know what this means? This is what I spoke about this morning; this is a widow's heart! Mephibosheth might have said, "David, who treated me graciously, is not here anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although they did not come to destroy me, my joy is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What is the use of decorating and beautifying myself?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He is not here anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Who has the heart to decorate?"</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We know that we are not worthy of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The world rejected our Lord and nailed Him to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On this earth we also have a widow's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The reason we can reject the world and not love it is because the person whom we love is not here anymore, not because the world is not lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The only thing He got from the world was a grave.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is why we cannot love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The world is a place which is contrary to us.</S>
