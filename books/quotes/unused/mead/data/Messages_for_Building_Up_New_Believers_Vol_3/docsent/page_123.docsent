   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. God s Kingdom Realized</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Everyone Serves</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If one day all the brothers and sisters in all the churches rise up to serve, the kingdom of God will come among us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It will be a kingdom of priests; all the people will be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I look forward to the day when all idols are removed from among us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before the Lord, we should pay whatever price it takes to achieve this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Levites paid the price; they were faithful in setting aside their personal affection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only such people can have a share in the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. The Basis of the Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s Acceptance</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to fully understand the priesthood, we need to understand the way God dealt with the priests in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a great matter for God to allow a person to draw near to Him without being smitten.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only the priests could eat the showbread, serve at the altar, and enter the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only they could offer the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others died when they entered the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s acceptance is the basis of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since God has accepted us, should we not enter in today?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Formerly, anyone would die if he dared to enter in. But today God says, You can come! How strange it is if we still feel reluctant to come.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>E. God s Mercy Enabling Us</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>to Serve in Grace</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need the Lord to open our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is grace in its highest form for a person to be given the privilege to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who really know God will say, The grace that allows me to serve God is greater than the grace which brought me to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The dog under the table can eat the crumbs underneath the table, but it cannot serve at the table.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be saved by grace is relatively simple, but not everyone can serve by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today in the church, everyone who is saved by grace can also serve.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is foolish not to consider this to be a great grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>F. Rejecting the Principle</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>of Having an Intermediary Class</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today s Christianity acknowledges the presence of an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christianity as we see it today even divides God s priests and God s people into two classes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We look forward to the day when there is no more hierarchy among us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There may be one or two persons in the church who have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the principle does not change.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today it is fashionable in Christianity to compromise principles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In principle, today s Christianity has fallen and has taken the way of the Israelites the people and the priests have become two.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May we not fall into such a system!</S>
