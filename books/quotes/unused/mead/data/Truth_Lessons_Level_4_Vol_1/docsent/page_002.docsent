   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this volume we will focus our attention on the prophecies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One-third of the whole Bible is prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of these prophecies have become historic facts, whereas others have not yet been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to their content, prophecies can be categorized as follows: 1 prophecies concerning Christ; 2 prophecies concerning the church; 3 prophecies concerning the believers; 4 prophecies concerning Israel; 5 prophecies concerning the Gentile nations; 6 prophecies concerning Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet; 7 prophecies concerning the last of the seventy weeks spoken of in Daniel 9; 8 prophecies concerning the millennium; and 9 prophecies concerning the new heaven and new earth in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this volume we will present the prophecies in the Bible concerning Christ, the church, and the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before entering into the content of each of these prophecies, we need to understand the importance of prophecies and the proper attitude that the believers should have in studying prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROPHECIES</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>IN THE BIBLE A. The Believers Needing to</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Give Heed to Prophecies</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not many believers consider the prophecies in the Bible to be important.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some think that prophecies are not interesting and are difficult to interpret.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others think that pursuing spiritual gifts, holiness, and the kingdom is crucial and urgently needed but to know and understand prophecies is secondary and optional.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are also those who think that the result of studying prophecies is merely the addition of knowledge and is not profitable for growth in spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are all misconceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Prophecies are matters that God requires man to know, and believers should give heed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second Peter 1:19 says, We have the prophetic word made more firm, to which you do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peter s word indicates that the word of the Old Testament prophets confirms and strengthens his testimony of Jesus Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>16-18 and is an inoculation for the believers against heresies and apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus also charged us to understand the prophecies Matt 24:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This clearly shows that the believers must pay attention to the prophecies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the church does not pay adequate attention to these prophecies, many believers will inevitably lose faith, be deceived by lies, be destroyed / Because of a lack of that knowledge Hosea 4:6 , and forget the Lord s coming by not being watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In his Epistles, Peter encourages the believers to give heed to the prophetic word made more firm, that is, to give heed to the prophecies when studying God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As to a Lamp Shining in a Dark Place</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Peter likens the word of prophecy in the Scriptures to a lamp shining in a dark place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that this age is a dark place like a dark night Rom 13:12 , and all the people of this world are moving and acting in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the believers do not have the prophecies in the Bible, they too will fall into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we need the prophetic word of the Scriptures, as a shining lamp, to convey spiritual light that shines in the darkness not merely knowledge in letters for our mental apprehension , guiding us to enter into a bright day, even to pass through the dark night until the day of the Lord s appearing dawns.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before the Lord as the sunlight appears, we need this word as light to shine on our footsteps Psa 119:105 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Until the Day Dawns and the Morning Star Rises</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Peter tells us to give heed to the prophetic word until the day dawns and the morning star rises in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This word is a metaphor, illustrating a coming time that will be full of light, as a bright day dawning, with the morning star rising, before dawn, in the hearts of the believers who are illuminated and enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we give heed to the prophecies in the Bible as a shining lamp within us, we will enjoy the morning star rising in our hearts until the spiritual day dawns within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the time of apostasy the believers do well to give heed in this matter so that the prophetic word, as a lamp, may shine through the darkness of apostasy until such a day dawns upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This will cause and encourage them to earnestly seek the Lord s presence and be watchful so that they will see the Lord as the morning star when He comes in secret Matt 24:27; 2 Thes 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, this metaphor alludes to the coming age, the age of the kingdom, as a day that will dawn at the appearing the coming of the Lord as the Sun of righteousness Mal 4:2 , whose light will shine and break through the gloom of the dark night of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Preceding this, the Lord will appear as the morning star Rev 2:28; 22:16 in the darkest hour of the night to those who are watchful and looking for His dear appearing 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The believers who give heed to the prophecies in the Bible will have Christ rising in their hearts to shine in the darkness of today s apostasy, before His actual appearing as the morning star.</S>
