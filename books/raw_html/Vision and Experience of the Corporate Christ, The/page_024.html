 <h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE PROCESSED GOD AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God the Father is in the Son (John 14:11), and the Son as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The last Adam, who was the Son with the Father (John 16:32), became a life-giving Spirit. Therefore, what we need to do is simply to drink. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;We...were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; We drink of the Spirit by calling on the Lord. When we use our mouth with our spirit to call on the Lord, the Spirit is dispensed into our spirit. The Spirit whom we receive is Christ (2 Cor. 3:17). Just as the watermelon juice is the essence of watermelon slices, the Spirit is the essence of Christ. When we exercise our spirit to call on Him, Christ as the Spirit is dispensed into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Assimilating Christ into Our Being for Christ<br />
to Make His Home in Our Heart</h2>
<p>Christ as the Spirit is dispensed into our spirit. For our body, God created a stomach to receive what we eat and drink. When we drink juice, we take the juice into our stomach. However, the juice does not remain there but is digested and assimilated into all our cells to constitute the organic tissue of our body. This reveals that what we eat and drink eventually becomes what we are. Our spirit is our spiritual stomach. We receive Christ as our spiritual food and drink into our spirit. From this organ, Christ is assimilated into all our being. The Lord is already in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), but we need to allow Him to spread from our spirit into our heart so that He can settle down in our heart. This is Christ&rsquo;s making His home in our heart (Eph. 3:17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Spiritual Growth Being the Increase of Christ<br />
in Us through the Metabolic Change<br />
of Transformation</h2>
<p>By our drinking the Spirit and allowing Christ to make His home in our heart, Christ dispenses Himself into all our being. Then we experience growth by the increase of Christ within us. True growth always comes from the increase, and the increase always comes from the nourishment. After being dispensed into us, Christ immediately becomes our nourishment, and we have the increase. By this increase we will grow with Christ and into Christ (4:15). Christ is dispensed into us, and we grow into Christ. This is a mutual mingling. Eventually, all the rich elements of Christ will be wrought into our being, and our negative elements will be discharged. This is transformation, a metabolic change in which something new is brought in to replace something old, which is discharged. How wonderful that there is such a metabolism taking place in our being day by day!</p>
<p>When we drink the Spirit by calling on the Lord and eat the Lord by pray-reading the Word, Christ as the life-giving Spirit and the living Word is dispensed into our spirit and gradually assimilated into all our being. This is the adding of a new element. This flow within us will simultaneously discharge every negative element. The change we experience is not an outward correction but an inward metabolic change. This change is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRANSFORMATION ISSUING IN BUILDING</h2>
<p>The more we are transformed in this way, the more we will desire to be with the saints. If we are not transformed, we may be happy to stay home and be alone. However, if we are being transformed, we will spontaneously have an appetite to go to the meetings and fellowship with the saints. This is building.</p>
<p>Building is to put on the new man (v. 24). According to Ephesians 2:15, the new man is a corporate entity composed of two peoples&mdash;the Jews and the Gentiles&mdash;and was created by Christ through His work on the cross. We are putting on the new man by putting on the church life. In other words, we are being built together. This is our experience of the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, and our foretaste of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH LIFE TODAY BEING<br />
FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF THE CORPORATE CHRIST AND THE BUILDING OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>The Jews know God as the Creator, the fundamental Christians know God as the Redeemer, and the inner-life people know that Christ is our inner life. We too know God in all these ways, but today by the Lord&rsquo;s grace we have been brought on to enjoy Christ as the Body-Christ in the church life. This is our building, our recovery, and our testimony. It is this recovery that will bring the Lord back. He is coming, and we are going forth to meet Him (Matt. 25:1, 6) not in an individualistic way but in a corporate way. Through the building in the church life, we will eventually have a jasper wall, clear as crystal and expressing God&rsquo;s image (Rev. 21:11, 18; 4:3), a city of pure gold with a street of pure gold (21:18, 21b), and gates that are pearls (v. 21a). The gold, the precious stones, and the pearls are all here in the church life.</p>
