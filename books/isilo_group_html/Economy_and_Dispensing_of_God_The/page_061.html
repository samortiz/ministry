From these three verses we see that the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is the base for our daily living. The first is verse 18, which mentions being estranged from the life of God. To be estranged, or separated, from the divine life is a serious matter. The life of God is for the supplying of His children with His riches in His divine dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Reality in Jesus for Infusing His Believers<br>with His Godly Living in His Humanity,<br>in His Divine Dispensing</H2><P>The second verse related to the divine dispensing is verse 21, which speaks of the truth in Jesus. The truth in Jesus is just the practicality of the life of God, that is, the practicing of the life of God, that took place in Jesus while He lived on earth. In the daily life of Jesus, as recorded in the four Gospels, there was something very real, and that real thing was just God's divine life realized and practiced as the truth in Jesus' humanity. This reality in Jesus is for infusing the believers with Christ's godly living in His humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Sealing of the Holy Spirit for<br>Saturating the Members of Christ with<br>the Divine Element in the Divine Dispensing<br>of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>The third verse concerning the divine dispensing is verse 30, which admonishes us not to grieve the Holy Spirit, in whom we have been sealed. This Spirit is the sealing Spirit; He is even the sealing ink with which we have all been sealed. The contents, the elements, and the essence of the sealing ink are the divine life plus Jesus' practical humanity. This sealing can never become dry; it remains wet forever. While it is wet, it saturates, permeates, and soaks us with the Triune God.</P><P>The life of God, the truth in Jesus, and the sealing of the Holy Spirit are the three sources of the divine dispensing. Seemingly, Paul was writing something quite ordinary, but within those ordinary words he put in the wonderful elements and factors of the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father's life, the Son's living in His humanity, and the Spirit's sealing. Life is of the Father. This life must become the truth in our daily living, which truth is the reality in Jesus. This truth as the practicality of the life of the Father becomes the sealing ink, which is the Holy Spirit. While the sealing ink seals, it saturates, permeates, and soaks us with the divine life in the practicality of Jesus' daily life, making us a "xerox copy" of Jesus' life, which is the practicality of the Father's life.</P><P>We have the life of the Father in us. We also have a model and an example, which is Jesus' life in His humanity. This life in His humanity is just the practicality of the divine life seen in the four Gospels. Furthermore, we have the sealing ink, which is constituted with the divine life and with the human living of Jesus. This sealing is wet all the time; it seals, saturates, and permeates us, enabling us to have a daily life that is suitable for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Economy and Dispensing of God &nbsp; pg 61</div><br></body></html>
