   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>36.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The One to Whom Gall</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Was Given, and Vinegar Also</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 69:21 says, They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a prophecy that Christ would be the One to whom gall and vinegar would be given.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Matthew 27:34 says, They gave Him wine to drink mingled with gall; and having tasted it, He would not drink.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The wine mingled with gall and also with myrrh Mark 15:23 was intended as a stupefying drought.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Lord would not be stupefied; He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Close to the end of His crucifixion, people continued to mock Him by giving Him vinegar to quench His thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 19:28 and 29 say, After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had now been accomplished that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A vessel full of vinegar was lying there; so they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thirst is a taste of death Luke 16:24; Rev 21:8 , and the Lord Jesus suffered it for us on the cross Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The hyssop in John 19:29 should be the reed in Matthew 27:29 and Mark 15:19, which was a hyssop reed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the beginning of His crucifixion, the wine mingled with gall and myrrh was offered to the Lord as a stupefying drought, which He would not drink.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But at the end of His crucifixion, when He was thirsty, vinegar was offered to Him in a mocking way Luke 23:36 , and He took it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Jesus then had taken the vinegar, He said, It is finished!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And He bowed His head and gave up the spirit John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>37.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The One Who Poured Out His Soul unto Death</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Isaiah 53:12 we see that Christ would be the One who poured out His soul unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Philippians 2:8b says that Christ was obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In His crucifixion Christ suffered to such an extent that He poured out His soul, His entire being, unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>38.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Pierced One</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies related to His death, Christ is also the pierced One.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Psalm 22:16 says, They pierced my hands and my feet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Zechariah 12:10 prophesies, They shall look upon me whom they have pierced.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Testament fulfillment of these prophecies is found in John 19:34 and 37.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 37 is a quotation of Zechariah 12:10.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 34 says, One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here we see that two substances came out of the Lord s pierced side: blood and water.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Blood is for redemption, dealing with sins John 1:29; Heb 9:22 for the purchase of the church Acts 20:28 ; water is for imparting life, dealing with death John 12:24; 3:14-15 for the producing of the church Eph 5:29-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ s death is, on the negative side, to take away our sins and, on the positive side, to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, it has two aspects: the redemptive aspect and the life-imparting aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>39.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The One of Whose Bones Not One Was Broken</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is the One of whose bones not one was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is typified in Exodus 12:46, prophesied in Psalm 34:20, and fulfilled in John 19:32-36.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Exodus 12:46 says that the children of Israel were not to break any of the bones of the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalm 34:20 says, He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Christ was crucified as our Passover lamb, His legs were not broken John 19:33, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Jews, not wanting the bodies to remain on the cross on the Sabbath, asked Pilate that their legs might be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The soldiers then broke the legs of the two thieves who had been crucified with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when they came to Jesus, they saw that He had already died.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because He had died, it was needless for them to break His bones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, under God s sovereignty not one of the Lord s bones was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both the type in Exodus 12:46 and the prophecy in Psalm 34:20 were fulfilled in the Lord s death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fact that Christ s legs were not broken signifies that in Him there is something unbreakable and indestructible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This unbreakable and indestructible element is His eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Roman soldiers and the Jewish people could come together to put Christ on the cross, but they could not break His eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can prove from the Scriptures that the bone signifies life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to Genesis 2:21-22, the Lord took a bone, a rib, out of Adam and built it into a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The woman, Eve, was produced from a bone taken out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, a bone signifies life that imparts life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The bone taken out of Adam imparted Adam s life to Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the same principle, Christ s unbroken bone signifies His unbreakable and indestructible eternal life that imparts His life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Christ as our Passover lamb there is such an unbreakable and indestructible life that can impart life to us.</S>
