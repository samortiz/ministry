   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOME SERVICE IN NAN-PING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I came to Nan-Ping two weeks ago to clear up some matters and to lead the brothers and sisters to know God in the way of inward life and outward service.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thank God for His co-working.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I saw God's presence, and the brothers and sisters were all moved to rise up to learn to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have now divided the services into gospel visitation, ushering, and cleaning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the area of cleaning, many sisters are beginning to come to the meeting hall to scrub floors and benches and to wash windows.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are all living and joyful, and they clean the floors and benches well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I truly thank God for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Huang Guo-bin</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May 6, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A REPORT OF A FELLOWSHIP MEETING Scripture Reading: Heb 10:25; 13:17; 1 Pet 5:5-6; 1 Cor 15:58</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our fellowship meeting tonight is a special gathering because there have recently been some new arrangements and decisions made regarding the work and business affairs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We want to explain these matters to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The New Arrangement of the District Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first thing we want to talk about is the new arrangement of the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We began the district meetings in May of last year, but now we have made some new arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have given each brother and sister a letter telling which district meeting to attend.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You cannot freely choose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are truly inconvenienced geographically, you can ask the business office to change your assignment, but please do not make any change yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reasons for this restriction are as follows: 1 The size of each district meeting place is different, so we must arrange the number of people according to the number of seats that are available.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, some places have been over-assigned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, there will always be some who cannot attend some meetings for personal reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We believe that these places generally will be able to handle everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2 There are 1,500 to 1,600 people in Shanghai divided into fifteen district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not designate who meets where, we will not know who has attended the meetings and who has not.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>3 We want to render the brothers and sisters practical help.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We want them to receive practical fellowship and visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not designate their meeting place, it will be difficult to achieve these goals.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have considered this matter very much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Combined Meetings and District Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second point is the combined meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can say there are two kinds of meetings now: combined meetings and district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There will be two combined meetings a week.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One will be at ten o'clock on the Lord's Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first Lord's Day of every month will be a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The rest of the times will be for edification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another meeting will be the fellowship meeting every Saturday night.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These two meetings will be in the first district at Wen-teh Lane.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There will be three district meetings a week: the table meeting on the Lord's Day evening, the Tuesday night prayer meeting, and the Friday night meeting for new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These will be held in the fifteen different districts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There will also be a Wednesday night gospel meeting which will be held in four districts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The gospel meeting is the meeting in which all the brothers and sisters must work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a meeting to work on others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The edification meeting is one in which a person is edified himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the fellowship meeting, one is either helped or is helping others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The table meeting is directed towards the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The prayer meeting is where we come before God to work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is the responsibility of every brother and sister to bring others to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We hope that every brother and sister can bring at least two people to the Lord in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It would be best if each one can lead five to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We hope that the brothers and sisters will bring their friends to hear the gospel at the Wednesday night gospel meeting in the district that is closest to them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The gospel meeting in the first district is especially important; it is a combined meeting of eight districts together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the brothers and sisters have to bring their friends to fill up this place.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The meeting for the new believers will be a message meeting for those who have just believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The word to the new believers is very basic in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are about fifty topics.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We hope we can cover them all within a year.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We invite all the brothers and sisters to come because, even if you have heard these messages before, you have not completely apprehended them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We hope that every brother and sister would receive this basic edification.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our requirements for this meeting are stricter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Please attend it in the district to which you have been assigned.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you fail to attend these meetings, you will bring trouble on yourself because somebody will come to visit you and make the lesson up for you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No meeting will be more closely monitored than this one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, if you want to avoid trouble, it would be best if you attended every one of these meetings.</S>
