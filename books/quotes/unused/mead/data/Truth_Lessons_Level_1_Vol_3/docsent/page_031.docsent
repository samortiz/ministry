   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>into Their Hearts</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We, the believers, are joined to God the Son because God has first shined Him into our hearts 2 Cor 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we heard the gospel, not only did we hear some preaching or teaching, but even more we received a divine illumination.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This illumination enables us to know the gospel of the glory of Christ, which illuminates, radiates, and shines in our hearts so that we may know the gospel, receive Christ, and have an organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. The Believers Having Received Him</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God shines Christ into our heart, He brings Christ into us that we may believe and receive Him as our life and everything John 1:12; Col 2:6a .</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we heard the gospel, believed, and received Christ, God then revealed His Son, Christ, in us Gal 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s revealing of His Son to us, the believers, is in us, not outwardly but inwardly; not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not an objective revelation but a subjective one, that we may know Him, receive Him as our life, and have an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>D. The Believers Having Been Baptized into Him</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The believers not only need to believe and receive Him; they also need to be baptized into Him Gal 3:27a; Rom 6:3a .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To believe is to believe into Christ, and to be baptized is to be baptized also into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By both faith and baptism the believers have been brought into Christ and immersed into Him, having thus been deeply joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>E. The Believers Having Put Him On</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we were baptized into Christ, we were baptized into Him as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we were baptized into Christ, spontaneously we put on Christ and were joined to Him as one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>F. The Believers Having Been Put in Him</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are joined to Christ because God has put us in Him 1 Cor 1:30 , transferring us from Adam into Christ 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was accomplished through Christ s crucifixion and resurrection Gal 2:20 and also through our faith and baptism John 3:15; Gal 3:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Christ indicates that the Triune God has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish a complete and full salvation that He may bring His redeemed people into an organic union with Himself, thus causing them to share with Him the same life, nature, and daily walk.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In His Death</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His all-inclusive death Christ has dealt with sin, sins, the flesh, the old man, the old creation, and all the ordinances and customs that cause separations among men.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All that He has accomplished through His death on the cross has become the practical, subjective experience of the believers by their having been identified with Him in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now the believers are growing together with Him in the likeness of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In His Burial</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God made the believers alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself Col 3:4 , into their dead spirit through His Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus He enlivened them that they might be identified with Christ in spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Following this, God raised us up together with Christ from the position of death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His resurrection was the germination of the new creation, that we who have believed in Him might become the sons of God 1 Pet 1:3a; Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His resurrection is proof that He has overcome death, including Satan, Hades, and the grave Acts 2:24, 31; Heb 2:14; Rev 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since we have been raised together with Him, we triumph in Him.</S>
