<h2 class="head1">LEARNING SERIOUSLY<br />
AND STUDYING CONSCIENTIOUSLY</h2>
<p>One may say that we are all learning here. I am happy for you, because there is a rare opportunity for you to learn to serve the Lord in this environment. This will expand your horizons and enrich your experience. You can practice speaking for the Lord in the district meetings on the one hand, and learn to take care of home meetings and group meetings on the other hand. Not only do the brothers and sisters have spiritual needs, they also have psychological and physical needs. Meeting all these needs necessitates the whole church to go on together. But how to take the whole church on so that the whole church will be on the right track, how to help the saints to have a life in the Word, in prayer, and in the enjoyment of the Lord&rsquo;s table, as well as how to have gospel activities, these are your responsibility. The success of this matter depends totally on the carrying out of the group meetings. We will have to apply all that we have learned in these two years to the group meetings. We must spend most of our time and manpower on the home meetings and the group meetings. This does not mean that we will no longer preach the gospel. The door-knocking to preach the gospel must not stop. We still need to teach new trainees how to knock on doors, to preach the gospel, and to get people baptized. We must even take out the newly saved ones to knock on doors to preach the gospel with us. When we carry out the group meetings and bring the new ones to serve, this includes the matter of knocking on doors to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the church in Taipei is a big church. According to the present situation with the meetings, we have the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings. The whole church is divided into more than eighty districts, under the twenty-three meeting halls. The meeting halls are mainly for administration, and the spiritual caring, nourishing, educating, guiding, and serving are all carried out in the districts. Hence, what we need to study the most is the matter of the various kinds of meetings. We need to do more research to find out the proper way to have the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings. Meanwhile, we who are coordinating in the services, the regular serving ones in the church and the full-timers in the training, are all within the boundary of the church in Taipei. All these people are like materials piled up on a site, and not built up yet. We still do not have a definite way to coordinate them together. Therefore, we must spend time to study to find out what we lack and what we must avoid. Then, from the information gathered through experiments, we will find the proper way and apply it to the practical need of the church.</p>
