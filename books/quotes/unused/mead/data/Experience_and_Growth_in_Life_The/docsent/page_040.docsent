   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORBEARANCE BEING THE SUM TOTAL OF THE HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians 4:5-8 form one section in which the first item touched is forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The content of forbearance includes all the human virtues mentioned in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Forbearance is the sum total of our human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Forbearance is the top virtue because it is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, forbearance is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 5 we are encouraged to express Christ as our forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the thing which opposes forbearance is our anxiety v. 6 . Anxiety is versus forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you live Christ, the character of your expression will be forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if you are a person who is full of anxiety, the character of your expression will be worry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our anxiety can be turned into forbearance by bringing every need, every request, to God v. 6 and by conversing with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To converse implies a kind of traffic back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every morning, regardless of how busy we are, we need such traffic between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of traffic brings in the divine dispensing, reduces our anxiety, and builds up our forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is by this traffic, the fellowship between us and God, that we enjoy the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you are full of forbearance, it will be difficult for you to lose your temper or to condemn or criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You also will not appraise people too highly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You will be fitting in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a guest in someone's home, you may be served tea.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are a person full of forbearance, whether the tea is hot, cold, or lukewarm, you will not express anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It should also be the same in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you are a person full of forbearance, the church life may be full of turmoil, but to your feeling of forbearance, the church life is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This feeling may seem contrary to the facts, but according to your sense of forbearance, the church is really wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is always wonderful according to its nature, but sometimes according to its condition, it may not be so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of its condition, we should always go along with the church according to its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your father is your father by birth, not by his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At times his condition may not be so good, but he is still your father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Forbearance is to be very moderate and very natural, neither too hot nor too cold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With forbearance we are able to go along with any person, regardless of their temperament or disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If, however, we move and act only according to our own likes and dislikes, we do not have a life of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we have learned the lessons in the divine life, we can easily be with another person in their situation without any complaints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they walk fast, we will walk fast.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they walk slowly, we will walk slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they stop, we will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they sit down, we will sit down.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Forbearance is a real test to the kind of life we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many times, for example, the wife cannot sit in the car while her husband is driving without complaining about his driving.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is very difficult for the wife to forbear while her husband drives.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>WHATEVER IS HONORABLE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A virtue mentioned in Philippians 4:8 is "honorable."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Honor means dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With God in His divinity, it is a matter of His glory, but with us in our humanity, it is a matter of honor or dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Christ ascended to the heavens, He was crowned with both glory and honor Heb 2:7 because He is a person who is both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In His divinity He received glory, and in His humanity He received honor and dignity.</S>
