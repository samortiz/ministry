   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EATING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not sufficient to understand the Bible we also need to eat the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jeremiah 15:16 says, Thy words were found, and I did eat them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, Matthew 4:4 says, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible is not only good for reading and studying, but, even the more, it is especially good for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Oh, we need to eat the Word of God!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The best way to eat the Word is to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want to enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we need to eat the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have pointed out that the bountiful supply of the Spirit is equal to the riches of Christ and that the riches of Christ are embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, to enjoy the riches we must pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE ELEMENTS OF CHRIST S RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The riches of Christ have certain basic elements.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first is divinity, and the second, humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Christ we have true divinity and a proper, uplifted humanity, a humanity which expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The third element of the riches of Christ is the human living of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The human living of the Lord Jesus was altogether wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In His human life on earth God was expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fourth element is His wonderful, all-inclusive death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The next ingredient is Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may use a carnation seed to illustrate resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After a carnation seed is sown into the earth, it sprouts, grows, and develops, and eventually a carnation blossom appears.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a picture of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Resurrection is a matter of rising up and growing up in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the Lord Jesus was crucified and buried, He rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the illustration of the carnation seed, we see not only the growth of life, but also the life shape, the life function, and the life power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ s resurrection with all these aspects is another element of His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet other ingredients are Christ s ascension and His glorification, with His enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Testament reveals Christ s divinity, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and glorification with enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Along with these seven basic elements, there are innumerable other ingredients: light, life, love, holiness, righteousness, peace, joy, patience, kindness, wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these, however, are subordinate elements; the primary elements are divinity, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All these marvelous elements of the riches of Christ are embodied in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But they are not embodied in the Word in a systematized way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Word of God simply cannot be systematized.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s riches are too profound for this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have pointed out that in the Bible there is embodied the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, we have seen that the Spirit and the Word actually are one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because the Word is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Word, they cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>PRAY-READING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we read the Word, we should mingle our reading with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we exercise our eyes and our mind, we should also exercise our spirit to touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then all that is in the Word will become in our experience the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us use Psalm 133 to show the difference between analyzing the Bible and enjoying the nourishment contained in it by pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In their time of personal devotions, some Christians may read Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As they read, they may begin to analyze and to ask about the precious ointment, the beard, the skirts, the dew, and Mount Hermon.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead of receiving the bountiful supply, they are left with many unanswered questions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if we pray-read Psalm 133, we shall take this portion in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we pray-read, we may say, Behold, amen!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How good and how pleasant, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By taking the Word in this way, we shall apply the all-inclusive Spirit to our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By pray-reading we exercise our spirit to receive spiritual nourishment from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through this nourishment we grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are nourished with the words of faith and healthy teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we take even as little as ten minutes to pray-read a portion of the Word, we shall receive nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, we shall experience the various elements of Christ s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the one hand, the food we eat each day nourishes us; on the other hand, it contains elements that kill germs.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no need for us to try to kill the germs in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should simply eat properly and allow the elements in the food we eat to accomplish this work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In like manner, through pray-reading the Word, we experience both nourishment and the putting to death of the negative things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we pray-read, we unconsciously and automatically partake of the basic elements of Christ s riches: divinity, humanity, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the one hand, the element of Christ s all-inclusive death kills the negative things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the other hand, His resurrection strengthens us and builds us up.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This does not come from outward teaching, but from inward nourishing.</S>
