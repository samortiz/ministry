<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Seven Churches Being the Same Normally<br>in the Positive Things</H2><P>The seven churches were the same normally in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ. In all the positive things concerning the Lord Jesus, the churches should be the same. In the Lord's speaking to the seven churches, the positive things were commended, strengthened, encouraged, and exalted by the Lord for the abounding. These positive things include: in Ephesus, labor, endurance, and the hating of the works of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:2-3, 6); in Smyrna, the suffering of tribulation, poverty, and trial, and being faithful (2:9-10); in Pergamos, holding fast the Lord's name and not denying the faith of the Lord (2:13); in Thyatira, love, faith, service, and endurance (2:19); in Sardis, not defiling their garments (3:4); and in Philadelphia, keeping the word of the Lord and not denying His name (3:8, 10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Seven Churches Differing Abnormally<br>Only in the Negative Things</H2><P>The seven churches differed abnormally only in the negative things, which were rebuked, judged, condemned, and corrected by the Lord for elimination. These negative things include: in Ephesus, some calling themselves apostles and not being such, and the church leaving its first love (Rev. 2:1a, 2, 4); in Pergamos, the church settling in the world, some holding the teaching of Balaam, and some holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans (2:12a, 13-15); in Thyatira, the church tolerating the woman Jezebel to teach and lead the Lord's slaves to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices (2:18a, 20); in Sardis, the church having a name that it was living but it was dead, and its works not being found by Christ completed before God (3:1-2); and in Laodicea, the church being neither cold nor hot, but boasting, "I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing" (3:14-15, 17). The Lord's rebuking indicates that the Lord does not want such differences.</P><P>By reading the epistles to the seven churches in Revelation, we can see that all the local churches should be the same in positive things, but not in negative things. The churches should be different only in business affairs. For example, whether a church buys a piece of land and builds a meeting hall should depend on the church's need and on the Lord's sovereignty. The churches should not be required to follow one another in affairs such as these, but all the churches should be one in all the spiritual aspects concerning the Lord's testimony. This is the first item as the base for us to practice the proper one accord.</P>
