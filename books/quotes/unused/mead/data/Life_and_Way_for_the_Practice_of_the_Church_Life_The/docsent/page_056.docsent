   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When the early Christians came together, do you believe they came with predestination, with Calvinism, or with Arminianism?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Of course not.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, they came with the Christ whom they experienced and offered to God as the burnt offering for God's satisfaction and as the heave offering, as the One who has accomplished everything and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today let us learn how to experience Christ in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to practice the church life, we do not need to learn some technical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must know that the way to practice the church life is to experience Christ daily.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone of us has to experience Christ daily so that whenever we come to the meeting we come with something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we will have much of Christ to offer to God as the heave offering, as the One who has accomplished everything, and also as the burnt offering, as the satisfaction to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The building of the temple and the city can come about only by these offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you keep coming together with your hands empty, with nothing to bring to God as the offerings, nothing will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The building depends on the offering, and the offering depends on the daily laboring on the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The building of the church depends on our offering of Christ, and our offering of Christ in the meetings depends on our experiences of Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to experience Christ by laboring on Him; then we will have something to bring to the meetings to contribute to others and to share with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By this kind of offering the building will be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We come together to meet, time after time, with the expectation that the church might be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if we are going to be built up, we need some material.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may say that we believers are the material, but actually in ourselves we are the garbage.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to be hauled away by the garbage truck.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not think that we could be used as material for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The material for the building is the Christ whom we have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we keep coming to meet again and again without something of Christ to contribute to others, there cannot be any building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we come to the meeting with nothing of Christ but with a lot of rubbish the natural life, the self, the flesh, and the worldly things how can we be built up?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The building of the city and the temple came out of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more the people offered, the more material they had to build up the city and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Their offerings depended on their daily laboring on the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have Christ, and we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is a very rich, good land, but we are lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We would not pay the price to cooperate with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We would not labor on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So when we come to the meetings, we come empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Meeting after meeting we are empty and have nothing to be built up with.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not think that just by coming together we can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be built up there is the need of some material.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why in the New Testament the apostles Paul, Peter, and even John all conveyed the same message that we have to grow up into Christ that we may have some measure of Christ's stature for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ephesians 4 shows that growth and maturity are needed so that we can have some stature of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>13, 15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is only by the increase of Christ within us for our growth in Christ that the Body of Christ can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to be transformed by Christ that we may have the stature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We cannot build up the church by meeting with empty hands.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must work on Christ to have the experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us look at the picture in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose all the children of Israel were lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They had a piece of the good land, yet they did not work on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No one would till the ground, sow the seed, or take care of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everyone just had a good time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They had no herds, no flocks, no wine, no oil, no corn, and no wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then when it was time to go to the feasts, everyone would go empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They had no food for God nor for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God was hungry, and they were also hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually, there would be no material for the building up of the city and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the real situation of the poor church today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many times this is the condition of our poor meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We come to the meeting with nothing of Christ, and we expect others to have something of Christ to share.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The brothers come with the hope that the sisters will have something to share, and the sisters come with the expectation that the brothers will have something to share.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually, nobody has anything to share, and the meeting becomes an empty meeting because we do not labor on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is the way to practice the church?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First, we have to realize that there is the need of oneness, and second, we have to realize that there is the need to have many experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to experience Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we will have something in our hands of Christ as food for ourselves and for the needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We will also have something of Christ to offer to God to satisfy God as a burnt offering and as a heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then there will be the material to build up a dwelling place for God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The proper way for us to practice the church life is to respect the oneness and to experience Christ in order to have a surplus of Christ to bring to the church to share with the saints in the worship of God so that God can be satisfied with Christ and enjoy Christ with us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we will have something built up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Besides this, there is no other way to practice the proper church life and to build up the church as the living expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is the urgent need for us to experience Christ, to minister Christ to others, and to help others to know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Without Christ there is no gold, silver, pearl, or precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Without Christ there is no material for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Without Christ you have wood, grass, and stubble, which are not good for the building up of the Body 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is a great need of prayer for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I hope that we will pray for this matter of experiencing Christ for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We cannot just learn the technique of practicing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If all we have is technique, we just have an empty church, a church without reality.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The reality of the church is the very Christ experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This very Christ is the contents of the real worship to God and the material for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I would urge all of us to pray much about this matter.</S>
