Everywhere we see man's rebellion. In any kind of human institution, we see rebellion and insubordination. Man wants to be free and independent. He has his own proposals, views, and judgments. But there are no such things in the kingdom of God. In God's kingdom there is only order and submission. There is nothing better in the whole world than submission, and there is nothing more beautiful in the whole world than order. Here we have submission, and we submit one to another. Here we have no arguments, and no one strives to be the greatest. There is only divine order. What a beautiful thing it is when everyone is pursuing after submission!</p><p>Allow me to give a little testimony of my own. I began to learn this lesson in 1922. At that time, I was learning in tears. Although the person to whom I had to submit was not necessarily right and although I may have been right instead, I would not have received the discipline of the Body if I had refused to submit. Perhaps at that time, there was not the discipline of the Body yet. But at least, there was the discipline of the Holy Spirit. When I first began to work for the Lord, I was quite young. Another co-worker was five years older than me. At the beginning he was quite zealous, but he did not have much light. However, God gave me a great deal of light. At that time many people exhorted men to believe in Jesus without being able to explain what they said. But I saw more light than others did with regard to the truth of the gospel. At one point over sixty people wanted to be baptized, of whom ninety percent had been saved through me. Since I had brought them to salvation, naturally I should have been the one to baptize them. But the other brother insisted that he baptize them because he was older. The Bible clearly indicates that whoever preaches the gospel also baptizes the ones he preaches to (Acts 8:35-38). I thought that it was quite reasonable for me to baptize them. Later, I went to Miss Barber, but she said that I should let the other brother baptize them. I asked her why, and she told me that the other brother was older than me. Later, I found another brother who was older than the first, and I suggested that the second brother should carry out the baptisms. But Miss Barber insisted that the first one carry out the baptisms. I was quite bothered. She told me that I should not reason, and she said, "Listen! From now on you have to learn to listen to your brother.'' I wondered why I should listen to a brother who was not clear about the truth or the way of God. This went on for three years. Every Sunday I fasted. God was teaching me the lesson of submission. Today I can work together with others because I have learned this lesson.</p><p>The Bible contains the centurion's word: "For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me'' (Matt. 8:9). This is submission. Brother Witness Lee once said to me, "You are very severe when you speak on the platform, but your speaking is not so severe when you step off the platform.'' Whether I am severe or not, I do feel that a person who will not submit to authority is a wild and disorderly person. Those who live in the church should submit to authority. A person who does not submit to authority may be saved, but he does not act like a regenerated person. Whenever a person is free from any authority, he has no way to go on, and he does not have the reality of the church with him.</p><p>With God there is the anointing, and this anointing is poured upon the church. On the one hand, we have to submit to the anointing within us. On the other hand, we have to submit to the anointing in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">Protection and Blessings in the Body</h2><p>A Christian is very safe today because there is the protection of the Body for him. A man can be miles off the target if a boundary is not defined for him. Today many truths have been established, and there is no reason for us to stray off any longer. As long as we remain in the Body, the blessings and the anointing are here.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
