   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. No Third Nature Produced</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some Bible students and even some Bible teachers have failed to understand the matter of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In ancient times there was a debate regarding the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence in the Person of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some who misunderstood this mingling said that it caused a third nature to be produced, something which is neither divine nor human.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To say that with respect to the Lord Jesus the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence produced a third nature, a nature that is neither fully human nor divine, is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, we wish to make it clear that this is not our understanding of the word "mingle."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We agree with the first definition of this word given in Webster's unabridged dictionary; mingle "to combine or join one thing with another, or two or more things together , especially so that the original elements are distinguishable in the combination."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to this definition, when two or more things are mingled together, their original natures are not lost but remain distinguishable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE SPIRIT WITNESSING WITH OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God" Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now that the Spirit is within our spirit through regeneration, He witnesses with our spirit, testifying that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two spirits within us correspond to each other, together confirming that we are God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse does not say that the Spirit witnesses and our spirit witnesses also.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It says the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To say that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit is deeper than saying that the Spirit and our spirit witness, for it indicates that the two spirits are one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To say that the Spirit and our spirit witness means that these spirits remain two.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But to say that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit indicates that the two spirits have been mingled and have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regardless of how young or new you may be, if you are a child of God, the Spirit of God witnesses with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Notice that it does not say "in our spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If it said "in our spirit," it would mean that only the Spirit of God witnesses, but that our spirit does not witness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, it says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, meaning that both witness together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit of God witnesses, and simultaneously our spirit witnesses together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some may say, "I don't feel that the Spirit of God witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where is the Spirit of God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I don't feel Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I don't have any sensation that the Spirit of God is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I never saw Him and I cannot feel Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I simply cannot sense Him."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, do you not feel that your spirit witnesses?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You must realize that as long as your spirit is witnessing it means that the Holy Spirit also is witnessing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You cannot deny that your spirit witnesses within you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Apostle Paul was very wise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When our spirit witnesses, that is also the witnessing of the Spirit, because the two spirits have been mingled together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very difficult for anyone to distinguish these two spirits.</S>
