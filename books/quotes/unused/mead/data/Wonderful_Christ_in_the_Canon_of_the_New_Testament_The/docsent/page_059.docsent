   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DOCTRINES ONLY DIVIDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Forty-eight years ago I picked up many doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was so sure that I was right, but I was just a little frog in a well with a narrow opening.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The sky to me was just one foot in diameter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I thought I knew everything, but gradually the Lord led this little frog out of the well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a sense I got out of the well and the sky was endless and spacious, but my sight was still confined.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then gradually, the Lord led me out of my confined sight.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I learned that doctrinally there is no end to man s argument.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man can argue forever about doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I finally realized that it is not doctrine, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Doctrines only create an argument.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1963, while we were having a meeting in Los Angeles, a brother came up to rebuke me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said that we were not scriptural because the sisters were praying and testifying in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then he quoted 1 Corinthians 14:34, Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, I knew this verse before he was born, but I did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I simply said, Brother, do you have any kind of meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He said that they did.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then I asked him, Do your sisters sing the hymns in your meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He answered, Yes, they do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then I told him that he was against the Scripture because the sisters in his meeting were not silent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the letter of this verse as understood by him, all the sisters must not open their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is just an illustration to prove to you that we could argue concerning the Scriptures forever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we argue, the more material we have with which to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible is not for doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible is for the revelation of Christ and the Church and for nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man lives not by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Doctrines can only divide Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can never be one according to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then with one mind and one mouth we can glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This can never be our mind or mouth, it must be Christ s. When we take Christ as our unique person, we are really one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have one person, one mind, and one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is absolutely possible for believers meeting together to be one by everyone taking Christ as his person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I was young, I was always taught to be patient, humble, kind, and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually I discovered that regardless of how patient and kind these teachers were, they fought with each other over doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So doctrine does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is only one thing that works, and that is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all need to take Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today, if you still hold on to some doctrines, it proves that you are short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we take Christ as our person, the more He will swallow up all the dissenting doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to open to the Lord and pray, O Lord Jesus, You are my person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I live by You.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I reject my person and take You as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we would pray this way for some time, all the dissenting germs would be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everything would be swallowed up by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then the church would be the one new man with one mind and one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>PUT OFF AND PUT ON</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ on the cross has abolished all the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the cross Christ took away our sins, crucified the old man, condemned the world, and destroyed the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the cross Christ has also dealt with another item the ordinances, which are the different ways of living and the different ways of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By abolishing the ordinances on the cross, Christ created in Himself one new man of the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now we need to put off the old man and put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not need to create the new man; it has been created already.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What we need to do is put it on.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must read the full context of Ephesians 4:22-24.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That ye put off concerning the former conduct the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which according to God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To put off the old man concerns the old, former conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is related to the old social life, the old community life, because our conduct is always related to others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No man can be unsocial; everyone likes to have a community.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We like to be with our relatives, our friends, our neighbors, and our classmates in order to have a kind of social life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>So to put off the old man according to the former conduct means to put off the former social life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When I was a young man I had my schoolmates, friends, and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then the Lord saved me, and from that day on He began to separate me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All of my schoolmates, friends, and even my relatives were gradually put off.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After my old communal life was put off, I needed a new communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord was so merciful in bringing me into the church life so that I could put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now the church life is upon me, and I am under the church life.</S>
