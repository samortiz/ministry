   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. In the Prophecies</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul charged Timothy to war the good warfare in the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means in the sphere, support, and confirmation of the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At this point we need to see something concerning the grouping and the timing of Paul's Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although Philemon is grouped with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, it was actually written earlier, during Paul's first imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul was imprisoned the first time because of the Jews, not because of persecution carried out by the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We know from Acts that Paul appealed to Caesar and this caused him to be sent to Rome, where he was imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During his first imprisonment, Paul wrote four books: Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, according to the time it was written, Philemon should be grouped with Colossians, Philippians, and Ephesians; however, in content it should be grouped, not with these Epistles, but with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Philemon was written not long before Paul's release from prison.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the book of Philippians he expressed his expectation that soon he would be released and visit the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not long afterward, Paul's expectation was fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Having been released, he traveled to Ephesus, where Timothy was, and from Ephesus he went into Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From Macedonia Paul wrote the first Epistle to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then from Macedonia he went to Nicopolis, where he wrote the Epistle to Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Timothy and Titus, therefore, were written after Paul's release from his first imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After approximately a year, Caesar Nero suddenly began to persecute Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At that time, Paul was accused of being the outstanding leader among the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was arrested and imprisoned again, this time due to Nero's persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From prison, he wrote the second Epistle to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter four he indicates to his dear child Timothy that he was ready to depart, to be martyred, to be poured out as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During Paul's first imprisonment, the churches were tested.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This test showed that decline and degradation had set in. This decline was altogether due to differing teachings, teachings that were different from the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was the reason Paul charged Timothy to war a good warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Throughout the centuries, the degradation and decline of the church has had one source: teachings which differ from the ministry of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts 2:42 we see that at the beginning of the church life, the believers continued in the teachings of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These teachings were the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What the apostles taught and preached was nothing other than Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They preached a Christ who had been incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended in order that, as resurrection life, He might be imparted into His believers to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the focal point of the teaching of the apostles, and it is crucial for us to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No doubt, in the Bible there are teachings concerning many things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the focus of the ministry of the apostles was the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, ascended, and glorified Christ to be our Savior, our life, and everything to us so that we may become His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the vital focus of the New Testament revelation, and this is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to contact the Word and receive God by the Spirit through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we shall have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By coming to the Word, we are infused with God, and spontaneously faith operates within us to bring us into an organic union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more we enjoy God's infusion, the more we become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, this vital matter has been lost for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Knowing the importance of this, Paul charged Timothy to fight a good fight, to war a good warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, Timothy was to war against the differing teachings of the dissenters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, he was to carry out God's dispensation according to the apostle's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we wish to carry out God's dispensation, we must do it not according to the teachings of traditional Christianity nor according to systematic theology, but according to the apostle's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, God's dispensation concerns the gospel of grace and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These are two basic elements in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This gospel is for the glory of the blessed God; it is for the expression, the manifestation, of the blessed God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Paul was in prison the first time, dissenters rose up to teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These differing teachings were the seed of the church's decline.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul realized the situation even while he was in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We know this by the contents of books such as Colossians and Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Especially in Colossians we see that certain isms Judaism, Gnosticism, asceticism had crept into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These differing teachings caused dissension and decline.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, Paul charged his faithful co-worker to fight the good fight against the differing teachings and fight for God's dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today we also must be on the alert for differing teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Throughout the centuries, the church has been poisoned and corrupted by such teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are not on guard, differing teachings may also cause damage to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the past we have seen the damage caused by differing teachings propagated in a subtle, hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This has helped the leading ones in many churches to learn the important lesson of being watchful for differing teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must not allow any differing teachings to come into the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The recovery is strictly for the carrying on of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By this I do not mean my ministry, but the ministry of the apostles, which began with Peter and is still being carried on today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All true apostles teach and preach the same thing, even the one thing God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The focus of our preaching and teaching is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To teach and preach God's economy concerning Christ and the church is to war a good warfare.</S>
