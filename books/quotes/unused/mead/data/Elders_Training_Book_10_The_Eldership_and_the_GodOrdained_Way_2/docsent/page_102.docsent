   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have to admit that over a period of time, we gradually drifted back to the practice of deformed Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, the elders among us nearly replaced the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the things of the church were in the hands of the elders and on the shoulders of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The eventual result of this practice was that everyone was fired and replaced with a clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The saints were not replaced with Christ but replaced with the elders among us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am concerned that although the way among us has been changed, our old practice actually still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The things concerning the building up of the Body of Christ are still mostly in the hands of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would like to give a testimony of my experience in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the Second World War, the central government of nationalist China moved back to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1946 the saints in Nanking invited me to come and visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually, they asked me to move there with my family to stay with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I moved there in 1947.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They had a meeting with me, which could have been considered as a meeting to initiate me into the service of the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I told them in the first message that I had a heavy burden to come to Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then I said that I was going to unload my burden and transfer it from my shoulders to their shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While I was with them, I did this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The elders should realize that the way that our Head, Christ, takes to build up His Body is to use all of His members.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Matthew 25 there is a parable about the Lord's slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some have five talents, some have two talents, and others have one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord treasures the one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The problem among us is that we trust too much in the five-talented and two-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By trusting too much in these two categories of people, we spontaneously and unconsciously annul the one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The God-ordained way which has been brought into the Lord's recovery in these recent years is prevailing to recover the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This way annuls the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, this way revives and resurrects the "laity."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the God-ordained way, the clergy is buried and the laity is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am concerned, however, that in some of the churches the eldership is still replacing the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a certain locality, many new ones may have come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They may be full of joy and rejoicing, but after five years they may become calm.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They become calm, and the leading brother who helped them becomes more active.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If such a situation is to be resurrected, the so-called clergy must be buried, and all the saints must be resurrected.</S>
