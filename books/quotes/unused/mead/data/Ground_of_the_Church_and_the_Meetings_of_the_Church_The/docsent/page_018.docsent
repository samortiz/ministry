   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SENSING THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE MEETING AND FOLLOWING THE FLOW OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, we must realize that we are coming to partake of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then second, we need to get our spirit ready and exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The third practical matter concerning the Lord's table is even more important.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We also have to sense the atmosphere of the meeting and follow the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These matters are very strategic.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to have a good meeting for the Lord's table, we must have all these main items.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may compare following the flow in the meeting to serving a feast, which requires that we know the proper way to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are to serve steak as the main dish, we must serve the steak first.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot serve ice cream as the first course in a feast of steak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must know what the first course is and that the second course follows the first.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we can have a proper feast in its proper courses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we come to the Lord's table, we have to sense the atmosphere of the meeting and follow the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In that meeting will we "serve steak," or will we "serve fish"?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can, for example, stress what the Lord is, or we may stress the ascension and glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the meeting there is always a flow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may illustrate the flow with a team playing a game.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In basketball, the five members of the one team do not play with more than one ball; they play with only one ball.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this sense, the ball follows a flow, as in a stream.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If one person in a basketball game plays with a football, and others play with many different kinds of balls, that game will be a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the best games, all the members play with one ball in one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this we need practice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although it seems that there is not much wrong with our Lord's table meeting, the tide of the Spirit is sometimes too low.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is due to the lack of the exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our spirit is not very living and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This may be due to the fact that we are afraid to make mistakes, but that still chokes us and quenches the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes certain hymns frustrate the flow of prayer very much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the beginning of the meeting there may be a real flow of prayer which is not fully expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not the right time to announce a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Any hymn at such a time becomes a frustration to the flow of more prayers in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At other times, the worship to the Father may be the best portion of the meeting, but just when we come to the highest tide, a certain hymn again can frustrate the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a hymn can be like cold water poured on the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just as we have the real sense that two or three more prayers will bring us to a climax, our mouths can be shut by the wrong hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To call a hymn in this way is the result of our forms, rituals, and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we have to learn to sense the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to forget about mere knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First we must sense the flow, and then we should exercise our proper knowledge to do things in an adequate, proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When there is a real flow of prayer, we should not do anything to frustrate it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes we need a hymn to stir up the praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At other times, though, we should not call a hymn because the praying spirit is already present.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To announce a hymn will stop the praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to follow the flow and not pay much attention to mere knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To always say that after four or five prayers a hymn is needed to match the prayers is to act according to mere knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The knowledge of the letter kills.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must pay attention to the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If there is a living flow, do not hinder it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Give the flow a free way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must learn to exercise the spirit to release something from within, and we must learn to always exercise the inner sense to take care of the flow.</S>
