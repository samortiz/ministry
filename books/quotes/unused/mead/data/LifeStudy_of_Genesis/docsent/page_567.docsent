   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ Coming as the Peace-bringer</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 10 says that the scepter will not depart from Judah nor the ruler's staff from between his feet until Shiloh comes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Shiloh means Peace-bringer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The proper kingdom is a realm of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you do not have peace, you are not actually in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The King must be the Peace-giver, the Peacebringer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When our King comes back, He will come as the great Shiloh who brings peace to the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But there is no need for us to wait until that day to enjoy Him as our Shiloh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may enjoy Christ as Shiloh today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Consider the example of family life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In a sense, family life is a stormy sea full of turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We never know when a storm will come.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have been sailing on the family-life sea for many years, and I can testify that it is often very stormy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Matthew 14 we read of the disciples' experience on a stormy sea Matt 14:22-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Jesus was about to go up into a mountain to pray, He charged His disciples "to step into the boat and to go before Him to the other side" Matt 14:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When evening had come, the boat was being tossed by the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, after praying there on the mountaintop, the Lord came to the disciples in the boat, walking on the sea Matt 14:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When He entered the boat, the wind ceased Matt 14:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The storm ceased because there can be no storm where Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The storm is not afraid of us, but it is afraid of the heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the storm may trouble us, it cannot trouble Him, for He walks upon the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the midst of the stormy family-life sea we should not pray in a begging way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, we should exercise the authority and say, "Lord, You are walking upon the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are the King and You have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now I exercise Your authority over this stormy situation."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Try to pray like this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the eyes of God the victory has been won, the kingdom is here, and peace is present.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we should not look at our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Matthew 14:28 Peter said, "Lord if it is You, command me to come to You on the waters."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter seemed to be saying, "Lord, if it is You, give me the word and I'll come to You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are walking on the sea, and I'll walk on the sea also."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord said, "Come," and Peter came out of the boat and walked on the water to go to Jesus Matt 14:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peter had the faith to jump out of the boat and to walk on the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when he began to look at the environment, his faith disappeared, and he began to sink.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Peter's experience is a lesson to us not to look at our environment, but to stand on the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Faith is a matter of standing on His word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Faith is not based on the environment; it is based on the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you jump out of the boat and stand on the Lord's word, many problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You have prayed too many begging prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead of begging, issue a command to the environment and say, "I will not allow you to disturb me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus is King.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The kingdom is His, and He is Shiloh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, I must have peace in my surroundings."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Often before troubles come our way, we have accepted them already.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is entirely a matter of psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before Satan, the subtle one, attacks you, he first takes you over in a psychological way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Job said, "For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me" Job 3:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before Job's difficulties came upon him, he thought about those difficulties and became afraid of them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be afraid of something means that you have already received it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever you are fearful, you must immediately say, "Satan, get away from me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am not afraid of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I do not accept this fear."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Fear is Satan's calling card.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you accept his calling card, Satan himself will come.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every fear is a calling card.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before Satan sends you the actual difficulty, he first sends the fear of that difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not accept Satan's calling card of fear throw it away.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a matter related to spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some brothers have been afraid of being laid off from their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A few days after they accepted this fear, they were laid off.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not receive the thought of being laid off, but say, "Satan, I will never be laid off.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although everyone else may be laid off, I will still be employed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because I am in the kingdom, I don't accept this fear."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ has won the victory, and the issue of His victory is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Submission and Obedience</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>of the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Genesis 49:10 says that unto Shiloh "shall the obedience of the peoples be" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This word refers to the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When Christ will come the second time as Shiloh, all the peoples will submit themselves to Him and obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In principle, it is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Where the authority and kingdom of Christ hold sway, there will be the submission and obedience of the peoples.</S>
