   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Regenerating and Transforming His Chosen Ones</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Make Them His Bride</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This God-man is the Bridegroom in the divine, universal romance John 3:29 , but His counterpart, being merely human, still does not match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A human without a divine source cannot be the counterpart of the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, God regenerated His human elect.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regeneration is to put divinity into humanity, to uplift humanity to the standard of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, regeneration does not complete the process.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We were regenerated in our spirit, but we are not only a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are even more a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to uplift our entire being, God first has to regenerate our spirit and then transform our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The transformation of our soul takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the romance in Song of Songs, we can see the process through which the seeker passes in order to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter four Christ s lover has been brought to live in His ascension v. 8 as God s new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She is no longer of Adam, who never lived in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now as a descendant of Adam she has been transformed to be another person to live in ascension as the new creation of God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As I am speaking these things, I realize that I am speaking another language, a heavenly language.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must learn this language, the language of the divine-human romance in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the seeker is living in ascension, she and Christ are living in one condition, the condition of ascension, to be a couple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is divine and human, and His transformed lover is human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are the same in life and nature, perfectly matching each other.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through her living in Christ s ascension as the new creation in resurrection for her growth in life and transformation by life, Christ s transformed bride becomes four things: a garden to satisfy Christ 4:12 5:1; 6:2-3 , God s dwelling place with its protection 6:4a , the heavenly bodies as the universal light v. 10a , and a terrible army which is the corporate overcomer the Shulammite vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>4b, 10b, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This Shulammite, who is the duplication of Solomon, is a figure of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation reveals that the overcomers will be collectively a bride to marry Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 17:14 and 19:11-21 we see that following their wedding this bride will become an army to fight with Christ, her Husband, to defeat Antichrist, a human opponent to God, with all his human followers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Antichrist with all his human followers will be absolutely defeated by the bride helping her Husband, who will cast them into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>BECOMING MATURE IN THE RICHES OF THE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>OF CHRIST TO BECOME A GARDEN TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through her living in Christ s ascension as the new creation in resurrection, the lover of Christ becomes mature in the riches of the life of Christ so that she becomes a garden to Christ 4:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For Christ s Private Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This garden is enclosed with a spring shut up and a fountain sealed for Christ s private enjoyment v. 12 . The spring is the Spirit of life and is seen in Revelation 22:1 as the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fountain is the source of the spring, which is God s throne.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The sealed fountain is for Christ s private enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As seeking Christians, in experiencing Christ we must have something private, hidden, shut up, and sealed which is just for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is different from the practice of Pentecostalism, in which everything is on the surface for open exhibition and hardly anything is sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must have something sealed for the One whom we love the most.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Full of the Choicest Fruit and the Chief Spices</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The garden is also full of the choicest fruit and the chief spices with their beauty and fragrance S.S. 4:13-14 . A rich garden grows many kinds of plants, which produce fruit and are full of fragrance and color.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This becomes the lover s beauty to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, this holy garden becomes the green bed 1:16b for the lover and Christ to live together in mutual rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The lover of Christ is now rich in life, producing fruits to nourish and refresh, giving forth sweet fragrances, and displaying beautiful colors to become a restful bed of green for Christ s rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Having a Fountain and a Well of Living Water</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the garden are a fountain and a well of living water, which are streams from the resurrection and ascension life 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fountain and the spring stream out from the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They flow out from what they are and from where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to be such people in resurrection and ascension, flowing with the essence, the flavor, the fruit, and the beauty of resurrection and ascension.</S>
