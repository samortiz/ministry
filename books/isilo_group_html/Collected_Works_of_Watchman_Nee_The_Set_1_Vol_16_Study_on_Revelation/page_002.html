The longhand notes of a brother who attended those meetings are published in this book. They have been briefly edited for the sake of clarity. The portion covering Revelation 2:19-3:22 is missing in the original manuscript.</P><P>In spite of the fact that a small portion is missing, this book forms a rather complete study of the book of Revelation by the author and is a valuable supply and contribution to the church in this, the end time.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
