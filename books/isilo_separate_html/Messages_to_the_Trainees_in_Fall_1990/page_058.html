CHRIST TO THE CHURCH</H2><P>Now we want to point out five items of Christ's being to the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Head of the Body, the Church</H2><P>We have already seen that, according to Colossians 1:18, Christ is the Head of the Body, the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Body of the Head</H2><P>Christ is not only the Head of the Body but also the Body of the Head (1 Cor. 12:12). Because He is the all-inclusive One, He is the Head and He is the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Foundation of the Church</H2><P>Christ is the foundation of the church (1 Cor. 3:11). As the church's living foundation, He holds, supports, and dispenses Himself into every part of God's building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Cornerstone<br>of the House of God, the Church</H2><P>Christ is also the cornerstone of the house of God, the church (Eph. 2:20). As the cornerstone of God's building, He joins together the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. All the Members of the New Man</H2><P>According to Colossians 3:10-11, in the new man Christ is all and in all. This means that He is all the members of the new man and in all the members.</P><P>We may wonder how the church as the Body of Christ can be Christ and how Christ can be all the members of the new man. In our experience, this depends upon who lives. If we live alone by ourselves, we are not Christ. If we live Christ, letting Christ live in us, then we live in Him, and we are Christ. I have seen some wives who really lived their husbands. They did things according to the index of their husbands' eyes. When they lived in such a way, they were their husbands because they lived their husbands. If the church lives Christ, the church is Christ. If we all live Christ, we are Christ. The Christian life should be like this.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> </body></html>
