   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ABRAHAM S FURTHER EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This divine word in the Bible is deep, and we are unable to understand it if we only read superficially.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abraham received God s element by a process of divine infusion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although righteousness had been reckoned to Abraham, he had not yet experienced that righteousness in a solid, concrete way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, we may have Christ as our righteousness without actually experiencing Him in a substantial way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the moment we called on Him, we received Christ, and Christ was made our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, Christ must still become our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, we need a Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sarah typifies grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hagar, Abraham s concubine, typifies the law Gal 4:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have Christ within us, but we lack the experience of this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who can help us with the experience?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Remember that Sarah typifies God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not work with the law by going to Hagar, but cooperate with grace by going to Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you join yourself to Sarah, you will experience Christ as your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not go to the law and do not make up your mind to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to recall Paul s own experience as recounted in Romans 7: To will is present with me, but to do is not.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you will to do good, it means that you are turning to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you determine to honor your parents, love your wife, or submit to your husband, you are turning to the law and marrying Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The result of this union is always an Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if you join yourself to grace, this union will bring forth Christ, the real Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Isaac signifies the solid experience of the righteousness which God had reckoned to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the day you believed in the Lord Jesus, Christ was given to you and infused into you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You responded in faith, and your faith was reckoned by God as your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way, God made Christ your justification, your righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, at that moment you did not have the actual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After you were saved, you went to Hagar, to the law, making up your mind to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To a certain extent you were successful, but the result was Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now you must join yourself to God s grace, to Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With Sarah you will have a genuine experience of the Christ you have already received.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In typology, the righteousness which God reckoned to Abraham was Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Genesis 17:21, God came to Abraham and said, Next year at this time Sarah will bring forth a son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Genesis 18:10 God reiterated this word in a slightly different way: Next year at this time I will return, and Sarah shall have a son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we put these verses together, we will realize that the birth of Isaac was actually the coming of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unfortunately, the King James translation obscures these two verses, using the phrase time of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The correct rendering of this phrase is found in the New American Standard Version, which says, Next year at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord told Abraham that the birth of Isaac next year would be the coming of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the birth of Isaac was extraordinary: it was the coming of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE BELIEVER S EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may apply all this to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the gospel preaching, through the appearing and transfusion of Christ, we reacted to God in believing with Christ as faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then God reckoned this faith back to us as our righteousness, which was a real experience of Christ at the time of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That was a return of Christ, a further coming of Christ to us after we reacted to God in believing with Him as our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result of Christ s appearing and His divine transfusion, He became our faith, reacting to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This faith was reckoned back to us by God as righteousness, and Christ further became the righteousness of God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By a further coming of Christ through God s grace, we had Christ as our righteousness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may summarize the process this way: in His appearing and transfusion Christ became our faith to God, and in return Christ became God s righteousness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then Christ became our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, we not only have Christ as the righteousness of God reckoned to us, but we have also the experience of Christ as our Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We treasure this experience, holding it as dear and precious and cherishing it as our only begotten.</S>
