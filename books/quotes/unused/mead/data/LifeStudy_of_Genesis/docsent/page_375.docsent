   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 Buried with Sarah in the Cave of Machpelah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Undoubtedly Abraham died in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His two sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>9-10 , which he had obtained for Sarah in chapter twenty-three.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It must be that his sons buried him according to his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>f.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Needing Jacob and Isaac</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>for His Completion</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although Abraham was good, he was not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He had to be completed and perfected by the lives of Jacob and Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the implication of the divine record, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In like manner, their God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, is not three gods but the one Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Abraham, we see God the Father; in Isaac, we see God the Son; and in Jacob, we see God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three-in-one, are the unique Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same principle, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are a triune person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Being three-in-one, they are a complete person in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1 Jacob's Being Chosen</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Abraham's record we see the matter of calling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the divine revelation, however, calling is not the first item.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's selection comes before God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Abraham was in Chaldea worshipping idols, that was the time of God's calling, not the time of His selection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The time of God's selection was before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In eternity past Abraham was chosen, and in Chaldea he was called.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But where is the record of Abraham's selection?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is in Genesis 25 in the record of Jacob's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In himself, Abraham had no selection; his selection was in Jacob's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Abraham's life had neither a full beginning nor a complete ending, for he had neither selection nor maturity in life, both of which are with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, as far as the experience of life is concerned, by himself Abraham cannot stand as a complete person in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He needs Jacob and Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These three persons, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, represent the spiritual experience of a complete man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the record of Jacob's life, there is no mention of being called.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Where and when was Jacob called?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was called with Abraham in Genesis 11, just as Abraham was selected in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Abraham we clearly see God's calling, but we do not see selection nor the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Genesis 25 we have three genealogies: the genealogy of the children of Keturah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>2-4 , the genealogy of the sons of Ishmael vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>13-16 , and the genealogy of Isaac vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>19-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the first two genealogies no one is selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>None of the sons of Keturah nor the sons of Ishmael were chosen by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even Esau, one born of Isaac, was not chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of all those named in this chapter, only one is chosen Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These three genealogies are put together in one chapter for a definite purpose to show the kind of person God rejects and the kind of person He chooses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God chose the most naughty one, Jacob, whose name means a supplanter, a heel holder.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we were God, we would never have chosen such a naughty, supplanting one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nevertheless, Jacob was God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We see in this chapter that what Abraham produced was not what God wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>None of his six sons was God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In producing them, all he did was in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Likewise, none of Ishmael's descendants were chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After Isaac had been married for twenty years, he "entreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived" v. 21 . Rebekah gave birth to twins, the second of whom was God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of the more than twenty births recorded in this chapter, all were in vain except one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this chapter God seemed to be saying to Abraham, "You have brought forth many children by your flesh, but all is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not one who is the result of your flesh is My choice."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This chapter reveals that the life which lacks maturity will always labor in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are not matured in life, although we may be quite active, doing many things, all our labor will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>None of it is according to God's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Abraham was a dear saint with a very good life, but his life was not mature and he did much which was in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Nothing that came out of his flesh was God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do you want to have a life like this?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By the record of Abraham's life we see that he was not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He needed Jacob and Isaac to complete and perfect him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As this chapter reveals, for his completion and perfection he needed Jacob's being chosen.</S>
