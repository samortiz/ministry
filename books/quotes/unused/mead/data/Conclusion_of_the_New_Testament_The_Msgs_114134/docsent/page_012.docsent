   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have covered the believers status, designations, symbols, life, nature, and past.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we come to the most crucial section of these messages on the believers their present.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We shall begin with the initial stage of God s full salvation, the stage of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. IN THE INITIAL STAGE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>OF GOD S FULL SALVATION,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE STAGE OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s full salvation is in three stages: the initial stage, the progressing stage, and the completing stage.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first aspect of the initial stage is that the believers experience God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Called</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we would understand what God s calling is, we need to realize that it is included in the initial stage of God s full salvation, that is, in the stage of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God begins to save us by calling us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In eternity God foreknew us, chose us, and predestinated us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then in time He created us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In time we also became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then God came in to save us, and the first thing in His salvation is that He calls us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that the One who foreknew us, chose us, and predestinated us before the foundation of the world, one day came to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In His visitation He may have caused us to think about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our thinking concerning salvation was not initiated by us but by the calling God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our thinking about salvation is a sign of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>a. By God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The believers are called by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that God s calling is not originated or initiated by the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is initiated by God, the One who calls.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is the Originator of His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to God s Predestination</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 8:30a says, Whom He predestinated, these He also called.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that we were called by God according to His predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is eternal and purposeful, and no one can change Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot cause Him to change His mind concerning His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to His purpose, He predestinated us in eternity past, and eventually He will come to us and gain us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because God s calling is according to His predestination, we cannot escape His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God calls every one whom He has predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to God s Purpose Plan</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The believers are called by God according to His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Romans 8:28b speaks of those who are called according to the purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here the word purpose is equal to a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s purpose is His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The purpose of God s calling is revealed in Romans 8:29: Whom He foreknew.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God s firstborn Son is the prototype, and we are the mass production.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is the model, the mold, and the pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has put us all into Him that we may be molded into the image of His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually we all shall be conformed to the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God s Son that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s purpose is to produce many brothers of His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When Christ was the only begotten Son, He was unique, but God desired to have many sons who will be the many brothers of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way the only begotten Son of God becomes the Firstborn among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is the firstborn Son, and we are the many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The purpose of this is that we express God in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s house is built up with His many sons for His kingdom, and the Body of Christ is built up with His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without the many sons God cannot have a house for His kingdom, and without the many brothers Christ cannot have a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, the many sons of God are for the house of God and then for the kingdom of God, and the many brothers of Christ are for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The kingdom of God is actually the Body life, and this Body life in the church is God s kingdom where He is expressed and where His dominion is exercised on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the purpose according to which God has called us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Another verse which reveals that we have been called by God according to His purpose is 2 Timothy 1:9: Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose....</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God has called us with a holy calling, a calling for a particular cause, to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The purpose here is God s plan according to His will to place us into Christ, making us one with Him to share His life and position that we may be His testimony.</S>
