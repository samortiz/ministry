OF LEADING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We hope that everyone will participate in this new beginning. Our leading in the past was to hold trainings, make arrangements, and fellowship. However, we now have many saints, especially with the church in Taipei. If I return merely to hold trainings, make arrangements, and fellowship, without being blended with you and moving forward together with you, there will be no result. Therefore, this time not only will I be involved in trainings, making arrangements, and having fellowship, but I will also participate in this endeavor.</p>
<p>Our current status requires a new arrangement. It may seem as though we are familiar with what we have fellowshipped, but the feeling within me is that every point is a new way. I will try my best to fellowship with you, and I hope that you will try your best to carry it out. If there are any problems or questions, even if I am in America, we can still communicate on the telephone. This will bring in better fellowship, leading, and arrangement.</p>
<p>I have placed myself in this endeavor and will &ldquo;drive this car&rdquo; with you and learn with you. The small groups concerning which we have fellowshipped involve a new way. The way to do the children&rsquo;s work is also new. We have many ways related to time, location, manpower, teaching material, and goal. We are not tied down to what we used to do. The campus work has been here for years, but we should be willing to change our way and make progress. Preaching the gospel in the community may be an old term, but we did not give it much emphasis. This time we are asking the working saints in every profession to open their homes and invite their colleagues to come and hear the gospel. This is also something new. Furthermore, the terms <em>visiting, shepherding,</em> and <em>teaching</em> may not be new, but we must admit that we have not carried them out thoroughly in the past. This is the reason that we are short in our ability to care for people.</p>
<p>We will spend much time fellowshipping concerning the way for the church to move forward so that we may find a new way. The church in Taipei just added almost fifty new elders. That was unprecedented. When a local church is large, meeting in twenty-one halls, it is not easy for the elders in the halls to take care of administrating and promoting the work. Therefore, I must place myself in this endeavor and help bear the burden together with the brothers. I am sitting behind the wheel with you, and we are &ldquo;driving this car,&rdquo; learning, and studying together. These items of our fellowship are new. Some of these items I myself have not even practiced before. Therefore, I am earnestly asking the Lord to keep me and give me a few years to be with you so that together we may bring all the churches in Taiwan to a new standard. This requires that we all participate. It also requires that all the brothers and sisters receive a burden to pray and coordinate.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO PILLARS OF TESTIMONY<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY&mdash;TRUTH AND LIFE</h2>
<p>The main burden of this message is to lead the elders and the deacons. It is also a fellowship about training. We need to see that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is His testimony. We also need to see that the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has two pillars: truth and life. The testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery does not depend on so-called power; neither does it depend on so-called miracles or theological teachings. The testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery depends on truth and life. Whether or not the Lord&rsquo;s testimony on the earth is strong and will be propagated largely depends on the extent to which the co-workers, the elders, and the deacons know the truth and grow in life. If the saints are strong in the truth and in life, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will progress, but if the saints are weak in truth and life, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has no future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Progressing in Our Knowledge of the Truth</h2>
<p>Concerning the truth, we need to have light. Truth is not doctrine. It is revelation and vision. We need to know the truth. In order to know the truth, we must read and study the Bible. If our reading of the Bible is not thorough and our learning of the truth is shallow, we can be certain that we will not receive light. The light of the truth is according to our knowledge of the Bible and our spiritual learning. The elders and the deacons must make progress and endeavor to enter into knowing the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Holding the Mystery of the Faith<br />
in a Pure Conscience</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:9 says that a deacon must hold &ldquo;the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.&rdquo; The faith in this verse refers to the entire content of the New Testament. The truth in the New Testament is our faith. In other words, the faith is the things we believe in. We believe in every truth in the New Testament, and we need to understand every truth in the New Testament. Believers in today&rsquo;s Christianity who are qualified to speak of the faith are rare, because their knowledge of the truth is superficial. The extent of their faith is that Jesus died for us so that we can believe in Him and go to heaven to be spared from perdition. Such a content of the faith is far below the standard of the mystery of the faith.</p>
<p>In the recovery there are many important items of the truth. There is the truth concerning the economy of God, Christ as life, living out Christ, living in the spirit, and being one spirit with the Lord in our mingled spirit. These items of the truth are nearly buried in Christianity, but they are what we have emphasized over the years. These basic items of the truth in the New Testament are the content of our faith. Paul says that deacons should hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, not in the mind. Often times our mind is very clear, but our conscience condemns us. We need to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
