In incarnation the very God became a man, and this man in resurrection became a life-giving Spirit. On the day of Pentecost, something marvelous took place in the universe. There was the blowing of a rushing violent wind (Acts 2:2), and the church was formed. God became a man, this man became the life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit brought in the formation of the church, the constitution of the Body of Christ. Now we have a Savior, we have an all-inclusive, consummated Spirit who is the reality of Christ, and this Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God. Eventually, on the day of Pentecost, He poured out Himself upon all His components to make them one church, one Body. We need a spirit of wisdom to understand to this extent, and we need a spirit of revelation to see to this high standard.</P><P>Dear saints, the church is the organism of the Triune God. It is not an organization, but an organism, and this organism is the organic Body of Christ. A wooden stand is an organization because it is a mere composition of lifeless materials. But our body is organic, full of life. The church is not an organization nor is it like an inorganic robot. The church is the organic Body of Christ.</P><P>Also, such a church is God's house. This means the church is God's household, God's family (Eph. 2:19). This is fully unveiled in 1 Timothy 3:15, where Paul told Timothy that the church is the house of the living God. Such a church as the house of God, as the family of God, is the manifestation of God in the flesh (v. 16). The church is not only the house as the household, the family, but also the house as a dwelling place. God has a family on this earth, and He is not homeless. His family becomes His dwelling place. He dwells in you, He dwells in me, and He dwells in all of us, the regenerated sons of God.</P><P>Ephesians 2:22 tells us that He makes His habitation in our spirit. The spirit of wisdom and the spirit of revelation eventually becomes God's dwelling place. In the United States there is a motel called "Travelodge." The church is not God's travel lodge but God's permanent lodge on this earth. On the day of Pentecost, something great took place. In the entire universe, God secured a lodge. What a great thing it is that today on the earth God has a lodge, a home, a dwelling place! Fifty or sixty years ago, I was teaching the saints about the church. I told them a number of things about the church, but if you ask me to speak on these matters today, I have no burden. My burden today is to tell you that the church is God's lodge!</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Issue of the Dispensing of the Processed Trinity and the Transmitting of the Transcending Christ &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
