<h2 class="head2">Not Becoming Tasteless</h2>
<p>In Matthew 5:13 the Lord spoke of salt becoming tasteless. When salt becomes tasteless, it loses its function. Some believers do not manifest their function as salt, because they preserve the self. Other believers do not manifest their function as salt, because they have lost their taste. The function of salt comes from its salty taste. When salt loses its taste, it loses its function.</p>
<p>Salt becomes tasteless when it returns to dust or to water, that is, when it is mixed with dust or water. To be mixed with water means to be defiled by sin and to fall into sin. To be mixed with dust means to return to the world and to be occupied by the world. In Luke 17 the Lord said, &ldquo;Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife&rdquo; (v. 32). This is a warning. Lot&rsquo;s wife became a pillar of salt because she took a lingering look at Sodom, which indicates that she loved and treasured the evil world that God was about to judge and utterly destroy (Gen. 19:24-26). A pillar of salt is a huge rock of salt. Salt is useful when it is ground into fine grains. A pillar of salt is useless.</p>
<p>Both dust, which signifies our natural goodness, and water, which signifies corruption, will cause us to lose our salty taste. If the kingdom people become tasteless, they are &ldquo;no longer good for anything except to be cast out and trampled underfoot by men&rdquo; (Matt. 5:13). May we all become useful salt before God. Many Christians are prosperous in the world, but they may not be useful in the eyes of God. Whether our life is useful depends upon whether we manifest the function of salt. On the one hand, we need to be rid of the elements of natural goodness and corruption; on the other hand, we must not preserve the wholeness of our self, and we must be willing to be lost among the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING THE LIGHT IN THE WORLD</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:14 says, &ldquo;You are the light of the world.&rdquo; Salt and light both speak of the influence of the kingdom people upon the world, but there is a distinction between salt and light. With regard to salt, the emphasis is on the nature of the kingdom people, but with regard to light, the emphasis is on the conduct of the kingdom people. As far as nature is concerned, salt is salty both inwardly and outwardly. Light, however, is only seen when it is shining and manifested. If light is hidden or is not shining out, it cannot be called light. The light in verse 14 refers to the light of an oil lamp. When a lamp is lit, there is light, but when the light is put out, there is only oil. This shows that light is not a matter of nature; light is a matter of expression and manifestation. Therefore, <em>light</em> here does not refer to the inward nature of the kingdom people; rather, it refers to their outward conduct. Hence, in verse 16 the Lord said, &ldquo;In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eliminating Darkness</h2>
<p>Salt eliminates corruption, but light eliminates darkness. What is darkness? Darkness is the absence of light. When light comes, darkness vanishes. If the kingdom people obey the authority of the heavens and allow God to live out of them, they become germ-killing and corruption-preventing salt in their nature as well as darkness-eliminating light in their living and conduct. Wherever the kingdom people are, there is brightness. Some people live in darkness and are confused inwardly; they have no understanding of spiritual things. However, when they enter into the church, they become bright inwardly and begin to see clearly. They are able to see what they were unable to see previously, they are able to solve what they were unable to solve previously, they are clear about things that confused them previously, and they are able to discern what they were unable to discern previously, because they have touched light, and light eliminates darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SHINING BY BEING FILLED WITH GOD,<br />
BEING DELIVERED FROM THE ELEMENTS<br />
OF CREATION AND CORRUPTION,<br />
AND ALLOWING THE HEAVENS TO RULE</h2>
<p>How do the kingdom people shine? In these verses light is generated by burning oil. Oil signifies the indwelling Spirit (Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9). In Matthew 25 the Lord spoke the parable of ten virgins going out to meet their bridegroom with their lamps (vv. 1-13). This parable shows that it is not enough to have oil in our lamp; we must have oil in our vessel as well. Although the light of a lamp depends on the oil in the lamp, we must have oil in our vessel in order to shine until the Lord comes. Man was created as a vessel for God (Rom. 9:21, 23-24), and man&rsquo;s person is in his soul. Hence, <em>vessels</em> in Matthew 25:4 signifies the souls of the believers.</p>
<p>To have oil in our lamp is to have the Spirit of God dwelling in our spirit (Rom. 8:9, 16). To have oil in our vessel is to have the Spirit of God filling and saturating our soul. In order to shine in the world, we need the Spirit of God not only to dwell in our spirit but also to spread into, fill, and saturate our soul. If the Spirit of God does not spread into our soul, we will not shine brightly. In order for us to shine, we must let the Spirit of God fill our soul. The Spirit of God is God Himself. Hence, to be filled with oil is to be filled with God. On the one hand, we are the salt of the earth; hence, we are being delivered from the elements of the natural man and of corruption. On the other hand, we are the light of the world; hence, we are being filled with the element of God. With regard to salt, the emphasis is on deliverance; with regard to light, the emphasis is on filling.</p>
<p>The kingdom people must first be delivered from negative things in order for their light to be manifested. Matthew 5:14 says, &ldquo;It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden.&rdquo; This indicates that the kingdom people are a city situated on a mountain; they are manifested before the world. This also shows that the kingdom people have a high and transcendent position. After the flood receded, the ark rested on the mountains (Gen. 8:3-4). There is not much dust or water on a high mountain. Therefore, a city situated on a mountain is delivered from the elements of dust and water. If the kingdom people are delivered from the elements of the natural man and corruption and are filled with the element of God, they are like a city situated on a mountain.</p>
<p>In the Bible a mountain also implies authority and ruling. According to Daniel 2, the Lord is the stone cut out without hands that struck the great human image and then became a great mountain that filled the whole earth (vv. 34-35). In the millennial kingdom the Lord will rule and reign over the whole earth. He will become a great mountain. Therefore, a mountain implies authority and ruling.</p>
<p>The city in Matthew 5:14 signifies our human living, because a city is the center of human living. The city situated upon a mountain signifies that the living of the kingdom people is situated and upheld on a mountain. Their living is their conduct and is based on the authority of the kingdom of the heavens and governed by the authority of the kingdom of the heavens. Thus, this living is a light that shines before men.</p>
<p>This light is the living of the kingdom people who are under the authority of heaven, and it is the conduct of the kingdom people who allow the heavens to rule. Such a living and conduct are delivered from the elements of the natural man and of corruption; such living and conduct are also completely subject to God&rsquo;s heavenly rule. Therefore, the Lord said that the kingdom people are a city situated upon a mountain.</p>
<p>As salt, we need to be dissolved, to lose the self, but as light, we need to be manifested. The function of salt depends on its being lost, that is, dissolved, but the function of light depends on its being manifested. As long as salt is lost, its function is fulfilled, and as long as light is manifested, its function is fulfilled.</p>
<p>In our spiritual experience what does it mean to be lost? To be lost requires us to lose the self. What does it mean to be manifested? To be manifested requires us to be filled with God and to allow the heavens to rule. When we are completely filled with God and allow the heavens to rule, we will be completely manifested. However, our person will not be manifested. Rather, our living and conduct will be manifested. On the one hand, our person is lost, and we do not assume a position, but on the other hand, our living and conduct are like a city situated upon a mountain, which is bright and manifested.</p>
<p>An example in the nineteenth century is the living of George M&#252;ller. His living is still like a city situated upon a mountain and manifested on the earth. Although we never contacted him, his living is manifested as light. He did not manifest the natural element, nor did he manifest the fallen, corrupted element. Everything related to George M&#252;ller was transcendent and heavenly and shined brightly before the world.</p>
<p>The Lord was on a mountain when He spoke concerning the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and concerning the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. This means that we must be delivered from dust, which signifies the natural element, and from water, which signifies corruption. A mountain has a high, fresh, and heavenly condition and atmosphere. Only when we live in such a condition are we able to understand the things of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
