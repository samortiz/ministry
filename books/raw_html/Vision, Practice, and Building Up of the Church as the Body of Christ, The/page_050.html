 <h2 class="head2">Not Setting Up a High Standard,<br />
but in Lowliness Loving the Weaker Ones</h2>
<p>First, we should never set up a high standard for others. To not set up a standard is the real practice of lowliness. Because by the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty I was born and raised in organized, formal, and fundamental Christianity, I have contacted many different schools, sects, and denominations. Although some are good, it is difficult to find any that do not raise up a high standard. Some claim the cross as their standard, and others say that holiness, the inner life, or spirituality is their standard. I met a small group of persons who even claimed that their standard is the fullness of Christ. Even the fullness of Christ can be a high standard that we set up. As long as we take something other than Christ as our standard, we do not have lowliness. If we put forth a high standard, we are not lowly in our mind and attitude.</p>
<p>Neither the subjective experience of the cross, the resurrection life of Christ, the gift of speaking in tongues, healing, or mission work is our standard. To have a mission work is not wrong. Likewise, to speak in tongues, to have healing, to preach the cross, to have the resurrection life, and to practice holiness are not wrong. What is wrong is to make these a standard. Regardless of how good, heavenly, or spiritual something is, as long as it is something other than Christ Himself, it will cause division. That is why today there is a &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; church, for example. Even if a group does not denominate itself based on a standard, in principle it is still a division. We should not even claim that Christ is our standard in a divisive way.</p>
<p>Claiming a spiritual standard has caused much damage in the past among all the Christians. The more spiritual Christians are, the more they kill others spiritually, because once someone becomes spiritual to a certain extent, he sets up that spirituality as a standard for others. In this way, his spirituality becomes a killing to others. Those who set up a standard often say that certain persons do not come up to their standard. This is a killing. Regardless of what kind of person one is, we should treat him or her as we treat everyone else. Many times it is easy for us to treat spiritual people in a good way, but it is not easy to treat weak ones, young ones, and wandering ones properly. This kind of different treatment damages the church life. In the church and among Christians we need to treat everyone in the same way, regardless of his or her spirituality.</p>
<p>Whether or not someone is spiritual and whether or not he loves the Lord much, we must treat him as we do others. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we should treat those who do not love the Lord even better than we treat those who do. If there is a backslider and a spiritual leading one before us, whom will we love more? This puts us on the test. We probably would love the spiritual person more, but this is not right. We all should love the backslider more. The other brother is spiritual already, so he does not need our love and care as much. The poor backslider, however, certainly needs our care. If we were to love him, he may no longer be a backslider. He will be brought back by our love. Many times it is simply our cold attitude that makes someone more of a backslider. He may not come back to the church simply because he cannot bear the cold faces. The weaker ones, the younger ones, and the backsliders need more love. From my past experience I have learned that in the church we should not overly appreciate the spiritual ones. Rather, to love the weaker ones, the fleshly and soulish ones, and the ones with problems will solve most of their problems. Otherwise, we will set up a high standard out of pride and not lowliness.</p>
<p>If we do not set up a standard, we will have true lowliness. We will be lowly minded, not highly minded. We will love the weaker ones, the younger ones, and the backsliding ones because the Lord loves them. According to the four Gospels, when the Lord was on this earth, He showed more love to the sinners and tax gatherers than He did to the good ones. This was true lowliness and humility. To have real humility is to set up no standard among us. This is the practical way to have the church life. The church life is very spiritual, but there are also many backsliders in the church. The church is a family, not a college. In a college almost everyone is in the same age bracket, from about eighteen to twenty-three, but in a family there are also younger ones, weaker ones, and even babyish ones. The family life is a picture of the church. Twenty years ago I stressed our standard of spirituality more than I do today. Today I can stand before you and say that in the church we should never set up a high spiritual standard for others. Rather, we must love everyone, even the worst ones. This is to practice genuine lowliness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sacrificing Ourselves to Be Meek in Our Attitude</h2>
<p>Verse 2 next mentions meekness. To not have a high standard is a test of our motive concerning lowliness. Our motive must be to love everyone in lowliness regardless of a standard. Meekness, however, is a matter of attitude. Our attitude must be one of meekness. The Greek word for <em>meekness</em> implies mildness, gentleness, and unselfishness. Our attitude in the church must be mild and meek. Therefore, we have no excuse; we all need to be broken. If we are selfish, we can never be genuinely meek. Rather, our meekness will be false. Only unselfish people have genuine meekness. In order to be meek, we must sacrifice ourselves. The more we sacrifice ourselves, the meeker we will be. If someone takes our Bible and does not return it, for example, it will be difficult to be meek in our attitude toward him. However, if we have a sacrificing spirit, we will be willing to sacrifice a Bible for our brother. We will say, &ldquo;Never mind. Praise the Lord! Please use it.&rdquo; This is to be meek in our attitude.</p>
<p>In this message I am not expounding Ephesians 4:1-3 in the way of mere Bible teaching. Rather, I am speaking according to my experience. If two brothers sit next to each other, one may be careless and kick the other one. Similarly, if two sisters sit together on a small bench, one may take up too much room, and the other will struggle to get back her half of the bench. These are tests in small matters, but they involve a big principle. We must be willing to sacrifice ourselves regardless of how we are treated. If we are willing to sacrifice and be unselfish, we will be mild and meek. Only selfish people are hard and harsh.</p>
<p>Our attitude comes out of what we are. If we are selfish, we will have a hard, harsh attitude. If we are unselfish, we will always be mild, meek, and gentle in a genuine way, not in a false way. In the church life we need this attitude, not a harsh, hard, or cruel attitude. Once in a certain restaurant a waiter spilled a cup of soup on my back. If I had loved my jacket, I would have said harshly, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Instead, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I was able to be meek. I told the ones with me, &ldquo;Be at peace. Do not be bothered.&rdquo; Unselfishness produces meekness, mildness, and gentleness. In order to have the proper attitude, we must not be selfish.</p>
<p>We must learn to have the proper attitude. We should not claim that our heart is sincere and our motive is right. That is not good enough. Only the Lord knows our motive. We are not the Lord; we are human, and we cannot see someone&rsquo;s motive. We can only see his face and attitude. It is not possible to speak harshly to a brother while claiming to have a good heart and motive. Therefore, in order to keep the proper church life, we must all learn to be adjusted in our attitude. In this matter we need true brokenness.</p>
<p>In many local churches the problems come mostly from wrong, careless, cold, and harsh attitudes. To have a right attitude is not a small matter. Satan, the subtle one, will utilize even a little carelessness in the way one brother greets another. He will fire a flaming dart into the brother&rsquo;s mind (6:16), and when the brother is in bed that night, he will have troubled thoughts about the other brother&rsquo;s attitude. This will create a certain amount of trouble. The next day that brother will be harsh to the other one, causing the other brother to have a further reaction. Eventually, the one careless greeting will cause a chain reaction; there will be a schism between the two brothers, and many misunderstandings will result. I am not speaking this in a speculative way. I have seen problems in the past due simply to this kind of reaction, which was due to nothing less than a little carelessness.</p>
<p>In order to have the church life, we need to learn that it is something very fine, not rough. According to the type, the church is a cake made of fine flour (Lev. 2:1-5; 1 Cor. 10:17). Anything coarse or rough does not fit the church life. I do not mean that we need to be nice in a worldly or religious way. Rather, we must have a fine expression toward the brothers and the sisters, behaving and conducting ourselves in a fine way. Our attitude is the most important item. If we would trust in the Lord for a proper attitude, we will be saved, delivered, and kept away from many misunderstandings. Almost all the misunderstandings come out of careless attitudes. Satan always utilizes careless attitudes to attack the church. This is why we must be careful with others, not for their sake only but even more because of the subtle one. The subtle one is here among us, so we need to be careful. We must not have carelessness in our attitude that can be taken advantage of and used for an attack by the enemy.</p>
<p>Meekness is a matter of an unselfish attitude that is mild and gentle, never argues for oneself, and never makes an excuse for oneself. Again I say, I am not presenting Ephesians 4:1-3 according to mere Bible teaching. I am speaking something from my past experience concerning the practicality of the church life. I suffered much due to carelessness in my attitude in the early years of my ministry, although the Lord can testify that my motive was pure. My motive was good, but people could not see my motive; they could see only my attitude. Therefore, we must be careful in our attitude and always be meek, mild, gentle, nice, and without excuses. Otherwise, we will have a wrong attitude, and this wrong attitude will be an advantage taken by the enemy in order to attack us. This is not a small matter. It is very serious.</p>
