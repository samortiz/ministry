THE FOUNDATION OF OUR SERVICE TO PEOPLE</h2>
<p>If we desire to be useful to the Lord, we must learn the truth. Truth is the foundation. To preach the gospel, we need to learn the truth; to speak with others, we need to learn the truth; to help others, we also need to learn the truth. If we do not know the truth, when people come to us with a problem concerning their marriage, we can only say, &ldquo;Our God is almighty. Pray and trust Him more. He will definitely save you.&rdquo; If someone seeks our help concerning his business, we will also say, &ldquo;God is almighty. As long as you trust in Him, He will surely help you.&rdquo; Regardless of the person, matter, or situation, we will always give the same answer. What help can we render? However, if we have sufficient knowledge of the truth, when people encounter a problem, we can speak to them according to the word of the truth that pertains to their particular problem. We can even strengthen the word with examples or experiences from the people in the Bible. If we do this, we will render genuine help to others. We should no longer use clich&#233;s to say things that do not even touch the point.</p>
<p>For example, when a sister has a problem with her husband, we should speak to her according to the word of the truth. Afterward we should wait for her response and listen to what she says. We can then strengthen her by telling her the story of Ruth in the Old Testament. In this way she will receive help and be able to resolve the problem with her husband. If a brother speaks to us concerning his business, we should fellowship with him according to the truth. Whether we can render genuine help to people depends on whether we are clear concerning the truth. Therefore, we must have the spiritual education of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING A SCHEDULE AND<br />
PRACTICING ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULE</h2>
<p>We should make a schedule for the seven days of the week, that begins with rising in the morning and ends with going to bed in the evening. The schedule should include our daily activities. Because we have our own circumstances, we should make our own schedule. This schedule will naturally reflect the specifics of our circumstances. If we love the Lord and pursue the Lord, we should make a schedule and practice according to our schedule. Otherwise, we will not succeed.</p>
<p>Certain things must be included in our schedule. There must be a time to contact the Lord daily, whether it is five, ten, or fifteen minutes. We should have a fixed time to have fellowship with the Lord daily. In our contact with the Lord, we must confess our sins. Perhaps we have committed many sins unconsciously, yet we have no feeling concerning them. However, when we fellowship with the Lord and He points out those matters and rebukes us, we should confess all the sins we are inwardly conscious of, one by one. We should confess our sins every day. Even though we have confessed our sins in the morning, if we become weak before noon, we should confess our sins again at noontime. Daily confession keeps our conscience pure and removes any barrier between us and the Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should constantly turn to the Lord. We should say to the Lord, &ldquo;I truly believe in You. You are the Spirit, and You are filling me inwardly. Fill me now, Lord, like the air filling my whole being.&rdquo; We should believe with our whole heart that the Lord lives in us and that what we speak through faith has authority, power, and boldness. Our schedule must include these three things, and we must practice them. We must fellowship with the Lord daily, confess our sins, and ask the Lord to fill us with Himself. From today forward, we should endeavor to learn the truth, and we should exercise to have a schedule. We should not feel that this is difficult. We are absolutely sure that as long as we practice step by step according to our schedule, we will walk in peace. If we practice these matters with persistence, considering them as part of our daily life, we will see the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 48</div><br></body></html>
