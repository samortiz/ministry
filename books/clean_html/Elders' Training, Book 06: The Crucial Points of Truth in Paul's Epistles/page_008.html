<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM OF GOD<br />
AS THE REALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Romans 14 is a chapter on the church life. It tells us how to maintain the fellowship with the saints to have the church life. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This verse strongly proves that the reality of the church life is the kingdom life. This realization requires you to go to Matthew 5 through 7. In those three chapters is the reality of the kingdom life. Romans 14:17 only gives us an extract of the reality of the kingdom life in three items: righteousness toward ourselves, peace toward others, and joy with God. In Matthew 5 those who hunger and thirst for righteousness and those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness are blessed (vv. 6, 10). Also, our righteousness should surpass that of the Pharisees. If we do not have such a surpassing righteousness, we cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens (v. 20). Matthew 5 also tells us, &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God&rdquo; (v. 9). Our Father is the God of peace (Rom. 15:33; 16:20), having a peaceful life with a peaceful nature. The sons of the kingdom are makers of peace. Matthew 5 also tells us that we are blessed when others reproach and persecute us, and that when this happens we are to rejoice and be glad (vv. 11-12). Romans 14:17 says that this joy is in the Holy Spirit. This is the kingdom life which is the reality of the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SUBJECTIVE SANCTIFICATION<br />
OF THE PEOPLE GAINED<br />
THROUGH THE GOSPEL PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>Romans 15:16 says, &ldquo;That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s work was to minister Christ to the Gentiles and His gospel preaching was a priestly service. He was an evangelist, yet in the eyes of God He was a priest in the service of the gospel, which I call the gospel priesthood. The nations, the believing Gentiles, became an offering to God. Paul as an evangelistic priest offered the believing nations, the Gentiles, to God as a kind of offering that the offering of the nations might be acceptable. After being sanctified, the Gentile believers are an offering acceptable to God. The Gentiles have to be sanctified not only positionally but also dispositionally. This kind of sanctification is a transformation in the Holy Spirit. When we preach the gospel, we must do it as a priest, not merely as a preacher. In our priestly preaching we minister Christ to the unbelievers. After believing they become our offering. As an offering they have to be sanctified, transformed, in their disposition, in their nature. God then accepts these transformed believers as an offering to Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</h2>
<p>The practice of the local churches is in Romans 16. Verse 1 tells us that Phoebe is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea. In verse 5 is the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila. Verse 16 refers to the churches of Christ and verse 4 to the churches of the nations. Then verse 23 says, &ldquo;Gaius, my host, and of the whole church, greets you.&rdquo; By putting all these verses together, you can see that the last chapter of the book of Romans is a chapter on the practice of the local churches. Romans begins from the designation of Jesus Christ to be the Son of God for the mass production of the many sons of God to be the components of the church, the members of the Body of Christ, and ends with the practice of the local churches as the expressions of the Body of Christ in many localities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if we would all rise up to study these crucial points and to teach the saints to speak them, this would attract, gain, and keep people. We need a lot of labor to get ourselves constituted with all these things; then spontaneously we will be able to speak, teach, instruct, and train others in these crucial points of the truth. All of the saints in the churches will then speak the same thing in their homes, schools, offices, and everywhere. Everyone who hears these deeper truths will be surprised at the real riches of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. From now on we must be people on a higher level, speaking the higher truths. This kind of speaking will be very dynamic.</p>
