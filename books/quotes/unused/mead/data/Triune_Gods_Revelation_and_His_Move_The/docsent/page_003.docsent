   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this series of messages, we want to fellowship concerning the Triune God's revelation and His move.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This fellowship will be the release of the crystallization of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first verse of the Bible, Genesis 1:1, says, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then Revelation 22:21, the last verse, says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This concluding verse is based upon the revelation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the beginning of the Bible, God is revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the end of the Scripture, the New Jerusalem is revealed as the consummation of God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The summarized content of the whole Scripture is God at the beginning and the New Jerusalem at the end. We need to be impressed with these two things: God and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible has been studied, taught, and interpreted for nearly twenty centuries by thousands of teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We thank God for this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What they have seen we inherit, so today we are standing on the shoulders of all the foregoing teachers of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this sense, we can "touch the heavens" easier than they could.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today the Bible is open to us, from the first page to the last page.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is as clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am burdened and trying to release what we have seen in the past seventy years in a brief and crystallized way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's revelation and God's move cover the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this first message we want to stress five things: the Triune God, His word, His revelation, His vision, and His move.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I. THE TRIUNE GOD A. The Triune God Being the Source of the Divine Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Triune God is the source of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With Him there is no beginning, but He is the beginning of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Triune God is self-existing and ever-existing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. Revealed as the Triune God in the Divine Revelation throughout the Whole Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This self-existing and ever-existing God is revealed as the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was a great discovery of the church fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although the Bible does not use the word triune, the church fathers saw the fact that God is triune in the divine revelation throughout the whole Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus said, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the Lord's speaking in many books, from Genesis to Matthew, He suddenly spoke of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we had been there, we would have been shocked.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We might have asked, "Lord, I never heard about these three.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who is the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who is the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who is the Spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are the composition of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is triune; He is three, yet one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first verse of Genesis says that in the beginning God created.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word for God here is in the plural.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then in Genesis 1:26 God said something to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the end of chapter three God said, "The man is become as one of us" v. 22 . The word us shows that God is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is one, but three; He is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord told us at the end of Matthew that we are to baptize people into the name singular of the three plural .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is one name for the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE TRIUNE GOD'S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This Triune God is so great and purposeful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has His purpose and His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to His desire, He made a plan, an eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the New Testament, especially in the Epistles of Paul, this economy is strongly stressed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul in 1 Timothy 1:3-4 told Timothy to charge certain ones not to teach other things, only the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is an economy of God in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to carry out His economy, God has to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A. The Speaking God</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Triune God is a speaking God Heb 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What if there were no speaking of God in the universe?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If God had not spoken, we would not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Bible says that every created thing came out of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Hebrews 1:1-2 Paul said that our God is a speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He has been speaking through the prophets in different ways, and now He is still speaking through His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His Son, Jesus Christ, is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When someone is ministering the word of God in the Spirit, apparently it is he who is speaking, but actually it is Christ, the Son of God, speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This minister of the word is nothing, but out of his lips something comes from One who is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God is still speaking today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>B. The Triune God's Speaking Becoming His Written Word the Holy Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Second Timothy 3:16 says that all Scripture is God's breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God is breathing, exhaling.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His spoken word was taken down to be the written word, which is the holy Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God's word was not only spoken but also written.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thank God that for nearly twenty centuries this spoken and written word has also been interpreted, taught, to God's people.</S>
