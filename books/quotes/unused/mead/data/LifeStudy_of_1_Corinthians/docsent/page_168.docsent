   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A REMEMBRANCE RELATED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO GOD S ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul s word in chapter eleven is related to what the Lord says in Matthew 26:29: And I say to you, I will by no means drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This word is found in Matthew, the gospel concerned with the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kingdom is a matter of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our eating of the Lord s supper must result in a remembrance that is closely related to God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Does your eating of the Lord s supper result in God s administration?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If not, your partaking of the Lord s supper is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While a believer is at the Lord s supper, he may say to himself, Oh, I realize that the Lord died for me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now His love constrains me in the evening of the Lord s Day to remember Him by eating His supper.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As I partake of the supper, I remember Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I remember His incarnation and how he was born of a virgin in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I remember how He grew up in the city of Nazareth, how He suffered and was persecuted, how He was betrayed, judged, condemned, and sentenced to die on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I especially remember that on the cross He died for my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To remember the Lord in this way is good, but it does not have anything to do with the kingdom, with God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the Lord s supper, there is no lasting result with respect to the remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If our eating of the Lord s supper stops with this kind of remembrance, our partaking of the Lord s supper is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The genuine eating of the Lord s supper must result in the administration of God; it must result in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our eating of the Lord s supper must be related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It should not be without a continuing result after each partaking of the Lord s supper is over.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the contrary, it must result in the kingdom, the administration of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, our eating of the Lord s supper must result in satisfying Him by bringing in the kingdom, by having ourselves and everything related to us brought into a proper relationship with God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not a matter that can take place in an hour s time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It can be accomplished only by a process which is yet to come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This coming process is actually the kingdom of God, God s administration, being worked out on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PROVING AND DISCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the relation between the Lord s supper and God s administration is a very serious matter, Paul charges the Corinthians to prove themselves and discern the body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not prove ourselves and if we do not discern the body, we may eat the Lord s supper without having the result of the remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to prove ourselves that our standing is proper, and we must also discern the body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then our eating of the Lord s supper will result in a full satisfaction to the Lord and also in the carrying out of the administration of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the proper eating of the Lord s supper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps you are wondering how the eating of the Lord s supper can result in the carrying out of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As Christians, we have been saved, we have been born of God to be the children of God, and we have been brought into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to John 3:3 and 5, regeneration brings us into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we had not been born of the Spirit, we could not enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But through regeneration we have been brought into God s kingdom and have also become members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to realize that we have been regenerated to become the children of God, to be brought into the kingdom, and to become the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once we have this realization, we need to consider the purpose of all this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why have we been regenerated to be brought into the kingdom and to become the members of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The answer is that we have been regenerated so that we may live a life for the kingdom of God and the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The kingdom and the Body should be the goal of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As Christians, we are not here simply to have a good life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many Christians love the Lord, but they do not realize that their life on earth is for God s kingdom and Christ s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be for the kingdom of God and the Body of Christ is to be for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today God s administration is carried out by the kingdom and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This should be our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then on the first day of the week we come together purposely to eat the Lord s supper with the expectation that our life will be a life for the kingdom of God and the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you understand this, you will know how eating of the Lord s supper may result in such a satisfaction to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Concerning the Lord s table and the Lord s supper, our understanding may still be under the influence of our religious background.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our mind may be so saturated with traditional thoughts and concepts that we have no capacity to take in anything new.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is to be like a glass that has been filled to the brim: there is no room in the glass for anything more or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To use a different illustration, our mind may be like an apartment building with a No vacancy sign posted in front of it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Unconsciously we may have put up a sign saying, No vacancy: I am not able to understand anything more concerning the Lord s supper.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am concerned that this may be the situation of nearly all the saints.</S>
