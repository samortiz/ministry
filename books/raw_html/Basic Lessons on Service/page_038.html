<P>The presentation of Christ as the peace offering to God the Father as seen in Leviticus can be fulfilled in reality at the Lord's table meeting. In this presentation there are four main parties: God, the offerer, the serving priest, and the congregation of cleansed people. The peace offering is for the satisfaction of all four parties. The fat and the inward parts of the offering were God's portion (Lev. 3:3-5). The flesh, the meat, of the offering along with four kinds of cakes were the portion of the offerer (Lev. 7:12-13, 15-18). The four kinds of cakes and the right thigh as a heave offering were the portion of the serving priest (Lev. 7:14, 32-34), and the wave breast, typifying Christ as love in resurrection, were for all the priests (7:30-31, 34). Finally, the congregation's portion was the flesh of the cattle under the condition of cleanness (vv. 19-21).</P><P>This shows that as long as you come to the meeting, you still enjoy Christ as the portion common to all the saints. But if you offer Christ in the meeting and function as a serving priest, you enjoy a special portion. When we open up our mouth and function in the meeting, we are the serving priests presenting Christ to God the Father for His enjoyment and our enjoyment. Without this worship of the Father in the Lord's table meeting, the presentation of the peace offering to God cannot be fulfilled.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. PRESENTING CHRIST<br>AS THE PEACE OFFERING TO THE FATHER</H2><P>We have to stress one point which all the saints at the Lord's table should know. This point is that there is no place other than the Lord's table meeting where the fulfillment of the peace offering can be accomplished. The fulfillment of the peace offering must be in the Lord's table meeting. After we eat the bread and drink the cup, the Lord takes the lead to come to the Father with all of us. He declares the Father's name to us and sings hymns of praise to the Father through us and with us (Heb. 2:12). At the same time, we offer Him as the peace offering to the Father. Then we and the Father, including all the serving ones, the offerers, and the congregation, enjoy Christ as the peace offering in a mutual way, not only in the presence of God the Father but also with God the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Peace Offering<br>Being the Center of the Basic Offerings</H2><P>There are five basic offerings in the book of Leviticus: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. The peace offering is in the middle, with two offerings before it and after it. Thus, it is the center of the basic offerings. It would be helpful to read the book entitled Christ as the Reality to see in more detail the significance of the five basic offerings in the book of Leviticus and the relation of the peace offering to the other four offerings.</P>
