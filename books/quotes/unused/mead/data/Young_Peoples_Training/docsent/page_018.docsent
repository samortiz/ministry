   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT A MUSHROOMING DEVELOPMENT,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT THE SLOW PROCESS OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With this as a basic concept, let us consider some other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all have some peculiar concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are not concerned about the preaching of the gospel, we simply do not care for it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when we are stirred up and burning, we take the thought that after a short time we shall bring many to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If, after a period of time, we have not brought anyone to the Lord, then we are disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many of us have known this disappointment in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But consider the fruit-bearing of a fruit tree.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fruit is not brought forth overnight; it takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It takes at least several months for fruit to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Gospel preaching is fruit-bearing through the overflow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It cannot be a mushrooming development.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, it must be the result of the slow process of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not expect that if you contact people for a short while, you will catch many of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a mistaken concept.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not suppose that after reading these messages of the young people s training, you will know the secret and that you will bring many to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There will be no mushrooming development.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, you will bear fruit in due time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most fruit-bearing trees bear fruit once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, peach trees and apple trees bear fruit once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is according to natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not expect that you will be able to bear fruit any faster than this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all must make a deal with the Lord, saying, Lord, I don t want to dream any more.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Grant me the overflow of life that I may bear fruit once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It takes time to bear fruit, but it should not take more than a year.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I look to the Lord that next year at this time we shall come together with some produce to celebrate the feast of tabernacles, the feast that comes after the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE NEED TO CONTACT PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You all must go to reach people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether you have the overflow of life or not, you must still contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do not reach people, you will have no way of knowing where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when you contact them, you will be exposed and become desperate, saying, O Lord Jesus, how can I go on?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Lord, I have discovered that I am empty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I were to tell you that you are empty, you would probably be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You must go and discover this yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>More than forty years ago, I learned a principle in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everyone has an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Usually those who do nothing are the ones who criticize those who do something.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, someone who does not know how to cook may be the first to criticize the cooking of others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the church life I have followed this principle: whoever criticizes others for the way they do a certain thing must do it themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a brother or sister comes to me criticizing others, I say, You are the best one to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since you criticize others, you should do it yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first time I learned this principle was when a brother came to me saying, Brother Lee, those responsible for the cleaning are not doing a very good job.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I replied, All right, you do it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When he declined, I said, You have been caught and now you must do it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are unwilling to clean, then don t criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, the news spread throughout the church not to criticize anything or anyone to Brother Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This one principle, which I still practice today, has silenced all the gossip and subdued all the opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The point is this: when you do something, you get exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you do nothing, you will think that you can do a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But when you attempt to do something, you discover that you cannot do the slightest thing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, go to reach people and discover how needy you are.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need to devote more time for contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One evening out of the week should be used for your personal affairs, three nights for the church meetings, and the three remaining nights for contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In addition to these three nights, I hope that you will use every lunch hour for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Make an appointment with people to have lunch or dinner with them.</S>
