<h2 class="head2">The Beginning of the Work in Chang-Pu,<br />Fukien Province</h2><p>God led Brother Chen Bing-hsi to Chang-Pu to pioneer the work there. He met several times in Yeh Jeng-kuang's home in Pu-Yi. It was a very good opportunity. Later, a Presbyterian minister invited Brother Bing-hsi to pray for a sister and to cast out a demon in her. The Lord graced him, and the demon left her. Thank and praise the Lord. After this he had a conference in a Chinese Methodist Church in the city for four days. The brothers and sisters pursued the Lord with a pure heart and happily received the truth he preached. I hope they will run in the straight way under God's leading. On March 22 we went to the eastern section of Chang-Pu to work in Fuo-Yun Village. There has been prayer for this place for many years, and God has begun working here. (There are seven or eight localities around this area, all of which would like us to go to them and work among them.) We have already had eight days of meetings here. (About one hundred people come to hear the word each meeting.) Many families burned their idols and wooden gods. They have left the false for the true. The Spirit's operation in them is really marvelous. There were also many sick ones who were healed of their illnesses after being prayed over and anointed with oil. However, the work of Satan was also very strong. We overcame him in the end by relying on the authority of the cross. May God the Father have mercy on us and give grace to the people of this region so that they may have more opportunities to hear the gospel. May the devil's work be destroyed. We hope that the Lord will send His workers here soon to release all the truth so that these people may be edified. After the ten days of work, we will work in Hu-Si, Lung-Wen-Shi, Jiang-Kou, Chien-Ting, Chi-Hu, Ma-Ping, Jiu-Jen, and Liu-Ban. May the Lord raise up His work that the truth may be released. May He call out His faithful children in every place and establish a local church in every place. Glory to His name, amen. We hope the brothers and sisters will pray much for the work here. We ask for your instruction. Please send us two copies of The Open Door.</p><p>Your little brothers,<br />Yeh Jeng-kuang, Lan Deng-hwei<br />April 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Soon to Go to the Philippines</h2><p>Last summer I received a letter of invitation from the Philippines asking me to go there for the work. I have been praying concerning this matter because I have not had the Lord's clear revelation. Brother Simon Meek recently sent me another letter mentioning the invitation. After a period of prayer, I understood that God wanted me to go. Thank the Lord, I am weak, corrupt, incapable, and unworthy, but I am now enjoying grace in Him. I only ask that the Lord strengthen me all the time so that I may work out my own salvation in fear and trembling. I also ask that I would become more conscious of my corruption, nothingness, and total inability. I want to know Him, the power of His resurrection, the fellowship of His sufferings, and to be conformed to His death. Indeed, this is the highest goal and the highest life. But should I not have this aspiration in the Lord? I am the last and the weakest of the co-workers. For this reason, I am asking X to bear some of the burden with me and to please pray for me before the Lord for grace. Please teach and encourage me so that I may be preserved all my life to stand firmly to glorify the Son of God, the Lord Jesus, who gave His life and shed His blood for me. Thank and praise Him. His great love has made me His slave forever. I am in the process of applying for entry to the Philippines. I hope to leave soon. There are at least one hundred fifty thousand Chinese in the Philippines. Most of them come from Changchow and Chuenchow. I hope that the churches in the Philippines can have the same testimony as the churches in China. I also hope that the work there can be completely mingled with the work in southern Fukien so that the brothers who return home from there can help the churches in every place.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Wu Ren-jieh<br />March 29<br />[Address omitted]</p>
