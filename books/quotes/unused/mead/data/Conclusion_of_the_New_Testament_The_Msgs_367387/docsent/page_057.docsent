   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-SIX EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES 92 108.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The One Whose Sufferings We Share</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Peter 4 Christ is presented as the One whose sufferings we share.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>a. Arming Ourselves with the Same Mind</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>of Christ Who Has Suffered in the Flesh,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That We May Cease from Sin</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Peter 4:1 says, Since Christ therefore has suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word arm indicates that the Christian life is a life of battle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to arm ourselves, equip ourselves, with the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that the mind of Christ is a weapon, a part of the armor needed in fighting the battle for God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 1, Peter advises us to arm ourselves with the mind of Christ, who has suffered in the flesh, that we might cease from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we are afraid of suffering, this fear may lead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, we should not be afraid of any kind of suffering; instead, we should arm ourselves with a strong mind, the mind of Christ, who Himself has suffered in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to be strong persons armed with the mind of Christ as a weapon so that we will cease from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One main purpose of 1 Peter is to encourage and exhort the believers to follow the footsteps of Christ in their suffering of persecution 1:6-7; 2:18-25; 3:8-17; 4:12-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They should have the same mind that Christ had in His suffering 3:18-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The main function of our mind is to understand and realize.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To live a life that follows the footsteps of Christ, we need a renewed mind Rom 12:2 to understand and realize the way Christ lived to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our practical daily life, the strongest part of our being is our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever we do in our living is directed by our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not the will but the mind that directs our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All our activities are under the direction of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the mind directs our living, the preaching of the Word must change a person s thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One goal of preaching and teaching is to change people s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we think in a certain way, we will be directed in that way, but if we change our mind and think in another way, our living will then have a different direction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What we think governs what we do, say, and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason, Peter charges the believers in 1 Peter 4:1 to arm themselves with the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To arm ourselves with the mind of Christ is to be armed with the thought and concept of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This implies that we change our way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many Christians think that as long as we love God and do His will, we will be under His blessing and will not suffer in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is common for Christians to have the concept that those who love the Lord should not expect suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But consider the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ loved God to the uttermost, and He did God s will fully and absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But what happened to Him in His living?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems that throughout His life on earth there was not any blessing but only suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was born into a poor family, a family not considered of a high class.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course, that family was descended from David and thus was of royal lineage.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when the Lord Jesus was born, that royal family was very poor economically.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, this family did not live in Jerusalem but in the despised town of Nazareth in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus lived in Nazareth for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the beginning of His life, He was put into a manger, and at the end of His life, He was put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He endured suffering upon suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He did not have a good name, and He did not have a place to lay His head.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the way the Lord Jesus lived when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His life was a life of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have the mind of Christ, we will realize that we are living in a rebellious age and in a crooked, perverted generation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the age is rebellious and the generation is perverse, the more we love God and do His will, the more we will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will suffer because we cannot go along with the trend of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We care to do the will of God, but the will of God is absolutely contrary to the trend, or tide, of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We would love the Lord Jesus, but this is utterly against the trend of this corrupted world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, if we love the Lord and do God s will, we are bound to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This will be our outlook if we have the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we arm ourselves with the mind of Christ for suffering, we will be willing to endure suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will praise the Lord that our suffering is part of our destiny, that God has appointed this for us, and that suffering is the portion of God s children in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In 1 Thessalonians 3 Paul tells the believers that God has appointed us to suffering and persecution v. 3 . God has not appointed us to material blessing; He has appointed us to suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, knowing that Christ suffered in the flesh, we also need to arm ourselves with the same mind.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not have the mind to pray for material blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That is to have the wrong kind of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In 1 Peter 4:1 Peter points out that those who have suffered in the flesh have ceased from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Pleasure heats up the lusts of our flesh v. 2 ; suffering cools them down.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The purpose of Christ s redemption is to deliver us from our inherited vain manner of life 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Suffering responds to Christ s redemption in fulfilling this purpose, preserving us from a sinful manner of life, from the flood of dissoluteness 4:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Such suffering, mainly from persecution, is God s discipline in His governmental dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To undergo such suffering is to be judged, dealt with, and disciplined in the flesh by God v. 6 . Hence, we should arm ourselves with a sober mind to endure such suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In God s economy, suffering accomplishes a good work for God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suffering very much restricts our lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The more material enjoyment people have, the more they will exercise their lusts and indulge in them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if we suffer poverty, persecution, or illness, this suffering will restrict the indulgence of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The devil uses riches to stir up lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God, however, uses suffering in the flesh to cause us to cease from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The sufferings are used to arm the believers with a mind against the flesh, that they might not live in the lusts of men but in the will of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>1-2 , that they might share the sufferings of Christ and rejoice at the unveiling of His glory vv.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>12-19 , and that they might be witnesses of the sufferings of Christ 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In 2:11 Peter also speaks of war, the war between the fleshly lusts and the soul: Beloved, I entreat you as strangers and sojourners to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Both 2:11 and 4:1 refer to the same kind of fighting, to the warfare between the lusts and our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>According to Peter s word in 4:1, we need to arm ourselves with the mind of Christ in order to fight against the flesh with its lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we would arm ourselves with the mind of Christ, we must have Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we try to arm ourselves with the same mind without having Christ as our life, we will merely be imitating Christ in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we have a strong mind to suffer, although we may suffer for the Lord s interests, nothing of poverty or suffering will stumble us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must arm ourselves with such a mind, but this should not be out of our natural boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is to follow the Lord Jesus Christ who took this narrow way of a manger and a cross.</S>
