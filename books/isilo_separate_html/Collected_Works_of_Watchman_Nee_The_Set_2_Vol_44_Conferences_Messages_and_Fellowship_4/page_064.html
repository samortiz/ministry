He loved His enemies. After Paul and Silas were scourged, they were thrown into prison and their feet were secured in the stocks. They were in much tribulation, but they did not take wine mingled with gall. They did not murmur against others, and they did not pity themselves. Their prayer and singing were genuine. When Paul saw the jailer drawing his sword to kill himself, he shouted, "Do no harm to yourself." This proves that he loved the jailer.</p><p>Some people first tell long stories about their suffering and then pray. Such prayer does nothing except pour cold water over our heads. Some wives come to tell me how badly their husbands have treated them, and how they have endured. However, I am afraid that such endurance has arrogance mixed in with it. It is a good thing to be joyful and to love, but if the joy is artificial, we should condemn it.</p><p>There were two Christians who were sisters in the flesh. One day the older one offended the younger one. The younger one kept her mouth shut, but she would sing every time the older one passed by. Her singing was saying, in effect, "See! You are defeated. You have offended me, but I do not take this to heart. I am victorious...." She did this to make the older one feel bad. This is the Pharisee's prayer&mdash;praying in an unnatural way and taking revenge by pretending to be happy.</p><p>What is the cross? Simply put, if I am one who bears the cross, there should not be any feeling of suffering in me. It is not something performed but something spontaneous. The prayer of Paul and Silas and the cry of Stephen all showed that they were men without need of wine mingled with gall.</p><p>The real bearing of the cross is not in any outward act, such as turning the left cheek, yielding the cloak, or walking the extra mile, but in the heart. Today many Christians are performing these three outward things, but the cross is not there. Bearing the cross is inwardly refusing wine mingled with gall. There is no jealousy, vexation, or revenge. Instead, there is genuine prayer, blessing, and love.</p><p>Paul put it well in Romans 12: "But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head" (v. 20). The spontaneous love that flows from you will heap a fire upon others. Pretentious love will not burn anyone.</p><p>In order to understand Paul, you have to read his Epistles to the Corinthians. Today there are some Christians who are like the Corinthians. If Paul praised them, they would say that Paul was taking them by guile. If Paul spoke a frank word to them, they would say that Paul was persecuting them. Under such circumstances, it is extremely difficult for anyone to say anything for himself. This is why Paul said, "I speak...as if in foolishness....I speak in foolishness" (2 Cor. 11:17, 21). "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I myself do not burn?" (v. 29). Although many criticized Paul, he was not concerned. His mouth was still open to them, and his heart was enlarged (6:11).</p><h2 class="head1">ONLY THE CROSS THAT CHRIST BEARS FOR US<br />IS THE CROSS</h2><p>Those who need wine mingled with gall are exercising pity on themselves. They can easily be provoked, and they scorn others by pretending to be happy. They are not actually bearing any cross. In reality, if we are bearing the cross, our cross is not a cross. Only the cross that Christ bears for us is the cross. When trouble comes and things bother us, the only way to avoid a total physical and mental collapse is to give the burden to the spirit&mdash;turning it over to the spirit&mdash;because our body and nervous system cannot bear it without feeling its effects. The cross is really very good for our nerves and our health. If it is not the cross, however, it is a studied course of action. The love that is rooted within, that originates from the cross, is a love that is mingled with Christ's love and flows into others. This love surmounts everything. There are many Christians who find it difficult to be Christians because it is all an outward practice, a striving to follow the outward principles of Christianity outwardly. This compulsion of oneself invariably leads to a breakdown.</p><p>It would be cruel of God to only give us Matthew 5 if He did not also give us the cross. When we know that it is no longer we who live but Christ and that we live by the faith of the Son of God in us, we find that there are no repercussions because He receives the blows, not us. We are dead and our life is hid with Christ in God. We escape it all&mdash;His right hand upholds us so that we do not collapse, and in the spirit we are carried through in Him.</p><p>Without a deep knowledge of the cross, trials and sufferings only bring reaction and collapse. But when the cross operates, there is only love. There are many things, in fact most things, that we can experience only in a limited way, but not love. This and only this can be fully experienced now. God has given all His love to us in His Son&mdash;we have seen the proof of this on the cross, and we have all of His love.</p><p>Being crucified and being wounded are two different things. When you are crucified, you have no wound. When you are wounded, you have not been crucified. I hate the feeling of a "martyr"&mdash;many have this feeling because they do not know the cross. They know tears, but they do not know bleeding. They are always seeking sympathy and pity for themselves on the plane of self-pity, not on the high plane of being seated in the heavenlies, reigning, and being able to forgive largely, freely, and regally like a king. You are great spiritually if people can crucify you but not wound you. Suffering and being wounded are one thing, but being crucified is another thing.</p><p>We hear people say, "So-and-so has experienced the cross deeply. For years she has borne the cross." But this is not true if there have been many tears; she only has the feeling of a martyr. Really knowing the cross is dying a kingly death like Stephen, quietly with perfect control, committing his spirit to God and praying for forgiveness for his slayers. We cannot pity him; we can only respect and honor him and worship the Lord. Those who truly bear the cross do not pity themselves; they do not need or want the pity of others. We look to the Lord to lead us into more knowledge of the cross.</p><p>Prayer: Our Lord, we come before Your presence to ask for Your forgiveness. How easy it is for us to be wounded or to boast or murmur in our suffering. May You cause us to love from the bottom of our hearts and to forgive without any pretense so that we may experience spiritual reality in our family life as well as in all of our circumstances.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> </body></html>
