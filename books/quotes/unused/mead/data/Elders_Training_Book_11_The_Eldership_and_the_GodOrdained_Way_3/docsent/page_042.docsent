   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Building Up a Habit of the Normal Way</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Spreading of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, we must build up a habit of the normal way for the spreading of the gospel Acts 8:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To build up such a habit requires that we have a psychological change in our logic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Concerning the gospel, our logic and our psychology is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many of us are thoroughly wrong in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must have a change in our logic carried out in our psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Often, the natural way of gospel preaching is to invite a good evangelist, a top speaker, who has much knowledge concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may bring our relatives to a meeting of such an evangelist to answer the altar call.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, many people saved in this way do not remain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should rather take the biblical way to go to our relatives personally.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After a few months one will be saved and will become our co-worker to contact the others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After a few years, many of them will be gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the living and effective way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Most of our relatives who are brought to the Lord by our personal contact over the years will be good preachers to bring others to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must have a change from the natural way to the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have a change, the Lord will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The proper meaning of visiting people for the gospel by knocking on their doors is to have personal contact with people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some churches have endeavored to preach the gospel, but they have had little result.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What they have lacked is the personal contact with people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should keep two or three gospel candidates under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have close relatives, we should spend our time, heart, and energy on them; we do not need to knock on new doors.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the past we have knocked on many doors, and many were saved and baptized, but the ones who were brought into the church were the result of regular visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must visit those under our care at least once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A nursing mother must feed her little ones regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same way, we must visit the new ones again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is true that regeneration is a miracle, but after regeneration, diligence is needed to feed the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we love the Lord, we must feed His lambs John 21:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the new ones are baptized, we must spend time to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must not try to bear fruit too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must have a change in our way for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should always have two or three gospel candidates under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do, one or two remaining fruit will be brought into the church life by us each year.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If only one-third of the attendants in the church life pick up the burden to do this, we will have a thirty to sixty percent increase.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to history, however, there has never been a church that had such an increase year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why Christianity has had a poor increase for the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since World War II, the Moslems have had a fivefold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, in this same time Christianity has not had even a onefold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have watched the Lord's recovery for the past sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What I saw forced me to tell the saints in 1984 that we could not go on in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I told them that the first thing we needed was to have the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we would spend two or three hours a week in the gospel, we will have one or two remaining fruit each year.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, even up until today not many have picked up the burden to go out weekly for the gospel in a budgeted way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason we do not see the proper increase in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today there is no opposition among us to the new way, but neither is there the real burden to go out for the gospel weekly to have personal contact with people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to our logic, to spend two or three hours a week to bear one or two fruit is too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not too slow, however.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A human being is brought forth after nine months of pregnancy, and after being delivered, requires a number of years to be properly established.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To contact people and spend our energy to care for them requires a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To contact people at our leisure is easy, but to contact them according to a budget and pray for the ones we contact requires that we have a heart to do it and be desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Building up a habit of the normal way for the spreading of the gospel also requires us to give up the influence of the traditional practice and to oppose our own preference in the way of gospel preaching.</S>
