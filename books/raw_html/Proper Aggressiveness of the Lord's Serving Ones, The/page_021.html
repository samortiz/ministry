	 <h2 class="head2">The Essential Aspect Being<br />
with Regard to God&rsquo;s Existence,<br />
and the Economical Aspect Being<br />
with Regard to God&rsquo;s Move</h2>
<p>The essential aspect speaks of God&rsquo;s existence, and the economical aspect speaks of God&rsquo;s move and God&rsquo;s work. The essential aspect of the Trinity relates to His existence, whereas the economical aspect of the Trinity relates to His move. Almost all the fundamental Bible scholars over the centuries acknowledge these two aspects: the essential and the economical. The essential aspect refers to the fact that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one in existence. This is based on Isaiah 9:6, &ldquo;A Son... / ...will be called /... Eternal Father,&rdquo; and also on 2 Corinthians 3:17, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Son is called the Father, and the Lord is the Spirit. Therefore, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one. This refers to His essence, His existence, not to His economy, His move.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is also clearly stated in the New Testament that the Triune God has a move; that is, the Father made a plan, then the Son accomplished the Father&rsquo;s plan, and the Spirit applies the Son&rsquo;s accomplishment. These are the three steps of the move of the Triune God: the Father&rsquo;s plan, the Son&rsquo;s accomplishment, and the Spirit&rsquo;s application. For this reason, when the Son came out of the water, after He was baptized in the river Jordan, the Spirit descended upon Him like a dove and the Father spoke to Him from the heavens (Matt. 3:16-17). This is economical, not essential. In John 17:1, after the Lord spoke to the disciples, He lifted up His eyes to heaven and said, &ldquo;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&rdquo; This is the Son on earth praying to the Father in heaven; this does not refer to the essential aspect of the Trinity but to the economical aspect.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting we first remember the Lord, and then we worship the Father. This is a matter of His economy. The essential aspect of the Triune God is for our experience and enjoyment; the economical aspect is for our service and worship. The Triune God dwelling in us emphasizes the aspect of His essence; our worshipping and serving the Triune God emphasize the aspect of His economy. We should never think that since the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one, our worship of the Father is the same as our remembering the Lord. This can be compared to our calling &ldquo;O Lord&rdquo; or &ldquo;O Father.&rdquo; In the table meeting we should never pray, &ldquo;Father, thank You for shedding Your blood for me.&rdquo; Neither should we pray, &ldquo;Father, You loved me so much that You even died for me.&rdquo; These prayers confuse the essential aspects of the Trinity with the economical aspects of the Trinity. This brief speaking is the essence of the studies in theology for the past two thousand years. It is altogether according to the Bible.</p>
<p>No matter how much Christianity is in confusion, our teaching is according to the sixty-six books of the pure Word of God. I have studied thoroughly almost every verse concerning the Triune God in these sixty-six books, and I have written many messages concerning the Triune God. Therefore, I am able to say in a simple and clear way that with respect to His existence, the Triune God has an essential aspect, and with respect to His move and work, the Triune God has an economical aspect. We need to enjoy Him and experience Him according to His essential aspect. We also need to serve Him and worship Him according to His economical aspect. Hence, in the table meeting we must follow the Spirit to remember the Lord, and then we must follow the Lord and the Spirit to worship the Father.</p>
<p>The last group of hymns in our hymnal under the category of &ldquo;Worship of the Father&rdquo; is titled &ldquo;His Praise from Many Sons.&rdquo; This group of hymns is the highest. Many Christians do not understand what &ldquo;His praise from many sons&rdquo; means. It refers to the praise offered by the Lord Jesus together with His brothers. <em>Hymns,</em> #50 is in this group and contains deep truth concerning God&rsquo;s economy. It is a hymn of praise to the Father from many sons. This is related to God&rsquo;s economical aspect.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING WITH FASTING TO INCREASE<br />
THE ATTENDANCE IN THE PRAYER MEETING</h2>
<p>Because it is difficult to have a Christian prayer meeting, the attendance in the prayer meeting of almost all Christian groups is low. For this reason, it is our responsibility to find out how to increase the attendance in the prayer meeting. If each of us is revived in our spirit, the attendance in the prayer meeting will increase twofold. Every person who prays knows that individual prayer has a certain taste but that prayer in a meeting has a strong and rich taste. Therefore, I treasure my personal prayer, and I also treasure the prayer meeting; neither can replace the other. A person who prays much by himself will attend the prayer meeting. Hence, we cannot expect attendance in the prayer meeting to increase without spending time before the Lord by ourselves. We must ask the Lord for a revival: &ldquo;O Lord, revive our gathering.&rdquo; We should even set aside time to fast and pray. In this way the number in the prayer meeting will increase.</p>
