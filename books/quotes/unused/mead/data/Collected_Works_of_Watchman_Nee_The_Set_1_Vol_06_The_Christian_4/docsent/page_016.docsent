   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Pharisee not only abstained from many evil things on the negative side, but did many commendable things on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He "fast ed twice a week" v. 12 . I am afraid that many people have never fasted once since they became a Christian! They may not even know what it means to fast! But this Pharisee was very strict; he mastered his body and did not give in to the passion of his lust.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was a self-disciplined person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He served God in a godly and dedicated way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The law did not require a man to fast twice a week.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He had even fulfilled what the law did not require of him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Despite all this, the Lord said that he would perish and go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Surely those who are worse than he will receive a more severe punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If this is the case, how can one hope to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He gave tithes of all that he had acquired.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was not a miser; he was a very generous person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His principle was to tithe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Very few Christians today give even one percent, much less ten percent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When offering time comes, many think that a silver dollar is too big and a silver dime too small.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But a copper coin is neither too big nor too small, so they offer it!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was not the case with the Pharisee.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was full of thoughts about accumulating wealth in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet the Lord said that he would go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A person who gives his labor and money still can suffer perdition!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a good man can go to hell, what kind of punishment will miserly ones receive?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From these points we can see that the Pharisee was a good and perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only was he good in men's eyes, but he was also perfect and without blemish in his own eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot say that he was a saint, but he was a very rare and good man in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, the Lord declared that he was not justified, that he was not saved, and that he was going to perish!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we think that we can be saved by doing good or that we are saved because we are good, we should realize that even if we are as good as this Pharisee, we still cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can we be saved by doing good?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How could the Pharisee possibly have been saved just by being a good man?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, good people should not be complacent!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not think that we can be saved because we are good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to realize, according to the Lord's judgment, that we still belong to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sinners, do not think that we should improve ourselves gradually and then be saved after we have been good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let me tell you that this is Satan's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only are we incapable of doing good, even if we could do as well as this Pharisee, we would still go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What use is it to do good?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord purposely chose this ideal and good person and said that he was still going to perish in order to disappoint those who rely on their self-righteousness and let them know that their self-righteousness cannot save them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way of salvation has nothing to do with ourselves Eph 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If anyone wishes to be saved, they should not look to the way of self-improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to be saved, one has to believe on the Lord Jesus Acts 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since this Pharisee was such a good man, why did he end up going to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What are the reasons?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now we will see the reasons why this good man would go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, he was one like those who "trusted in themselves that they were righteous" Luke 18:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was an outstanding person according to moral standards.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was very content and thought that he could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It seemed that no one else could go to heaven if he could not go.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To "trust" means to depend upon.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He depended upon his own righteous works and thought his righteous works could justify or save him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He did not realize that "all of us became like him who is unclean, / And all our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment" Isa 64:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>None of these things can cover our shame and shelter us from God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He did not know that in God's eyes, "there is none righteous, not even one" Rom 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He thought that he was "not like the rest of men," that he was the one and only righteous man on earth!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He thought that he conducted himself according to the law and even did more than what the law required.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, he thought he would surely be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is just like many others who think that they can be saved by good works.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the Bible says, "Out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him" Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It also says, "For we the apostles account that a man is justified...apart from the works of the law" Rom 3:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"A man is not justified out of works of law...we might be justified...not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified" Gal 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"By law no one is justified before God" 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Not out of works in righteousness which we did...He saved us" Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"The works of law" mean good works.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Not being justified by the works of the law means that one cannot be saved by doing good works.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This has been repeatedly made clear in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although the Pharisee had righteous works, he did not realize that his righteous works could not save him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was one of those who "trusted in themselves that they were righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He wanted to go to heaven, but eventually he ended up in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How pitiful!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He thought his own righteousness was sufficient and did not seek the righteousness which was prepared by God in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As a result, he fell into perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Man's righteousness does not satisfy God; He will not save anyone unless He sees His own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because this Pharisee was "ignorant of God's righteousness and sought to establish his own righteousness, he was not subject to the righteousness of God" Rom 10:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To not be subject is to rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This man was a rebel in the face of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How could he have any hope of being saved?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Oh, how numerous are the descendants of this Pharisee today!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many still think that they are a good man, that they are therefore saved.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many think that they should do good in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But the Lord said that good men go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you are this type of person, please turn back quickly and believe in the Lord Jesus because your good works cannot save you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Nothing in this world is less dependable than your own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The righteous Pharisee who depended upon his own righteousness has already gone to hell and has become a pattern to those who want to be saved through doing good works.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Why should you suffer by following in the same footsteps?</S>
