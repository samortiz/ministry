   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There Should Be Fullness of Life Within</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sometimes we come across a brother who has acted very foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to what is proper, we should strongly exhort or rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We tell ourselves that he requires a serious, thorough dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We prepare ourselves to face the situation because we know he will be around for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We go to his home and knock on the door, but then we ask ourselves whether we are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He acted foolishly, so what can we do but exhort him?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have gone to his door and raised our hand to knock, but inwardly there is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our raised hand drops to our side.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though we have convinced ourselves that we are right, this is not a matter of right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a matter of whether or not the life of God allows us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many times when we go to exhort a brother, he will receive our exhortation with courtesy and promise to do what God says.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet the more we preach to him, the more our inward being wilts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we return home, we have to admit that we have been wrong in exhorting the brother!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, it is not a matter of good or bad but a matter of being full of life inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I will give you another example.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I met a needy brother a few days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was extremely poor and needed some help.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I thought that I certainly should do something for him because there was no prospect of help coming to him from any direction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just at that point I had no surplus, so it was a great sacrifice to come to his aid.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I seemed to be exceeding the limits of my strength to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to what is proper, I was right.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I should have been happy as I gave him some money.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet for some unknown reason, I wilted inwardly as I gave him the money which I had promised to give him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A voice within said, "You are just acting on charity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That was not an act of life; it was merely human chivalry and natural kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was not done in life but in yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God did not want me to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have suffered concerning that matter for two or three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even though I had given the brother money, I had to bow before God, confess my sin, and ask His forgiveness when I reached home.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Living and Actions Must Be</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>according to the Leading of Life</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, as we live before God, our actions must not be determined by good and evil, but by the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever life wants us to do is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Anything that we do without life, no matter how good it may be, will bring us nothing but inward condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A Christian should not only repent before God for the sins he has committed; often, he must repent before God for the good things he has done.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The principle of our living is not one that differentiates between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must come before God to determine what is of life and what is of death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we have life within and feel life rising up, we are doing the proper thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the life does not rise up and we cannot sense the anointing in our being, we should not care whether we are acting according to right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, we must confess before God and ask His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul said that he judged nothing by himself, but that only God judged him 1 Cor 4:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many people do not understand this passage in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This sentence is very simple, but if we do not know life, it is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have an outward standard of good and evil, it is very easy to judge when we are wrong and right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul did not act according to an outward standard of right and wrong, so he could only say, "I do not even examine myself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The one who examines us before the judgment seat is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In addition, we have a life within us that leads us on.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is the reason 2 Corinthians 5:7 says, "We walk by faith, not by appearance."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not determine things by an outward, visible law.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We live according to the leading which the Lord gives us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must learn the lesson before God that we should never act merely according to the standard of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The standard of right and wrong is not bad; it is a good standard, but it is not good enough for a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Christian's standard surpasses right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The things which are wrong are wrong, but the things which are right are not always right.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we act according to God's life, He will show us that His demands are higher than those of human law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This being the case, it becomes very easy to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In every matter when we seek God's speaking within us, spontaneously there will be the shining of inward light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Please remember that our regeneration is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is also a fact that God is living in us through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord is constantly expressing Himself within us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We hope that each of us would be able to say to God, "Grace me so that I live by the tree of life, not by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I want to constantly pay attention to life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I want to ask, What is the sense of life?'"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we live by this principle, we will see a great change in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many problems arise because we only have a standard of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many mistakes are made because we do not have the standard of life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we have the standard of life, many problems will be resolved.</S>
