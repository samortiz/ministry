   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DANCE OF TWO ARMIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After seeing such a high vision in Song of Songs, we may ask, Who can be such persons?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to answer this we need an additional interpretation of 6:13b, which says, Why should you gaze at the Shulammite, / As upon the dance of two camps?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By this time the Shulammite was like two camps, or armies, in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These two armies are dancing in celebration of their victory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The country girl eventually attained the status of the Shulammite.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The name Shulammite is not mentioned in the beginning of Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only in 6:13 is her name mentioned in a very extraordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this verse the Shulammite is likened to two armies, or camps, dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This phrase two armies in Hebrew is Mahanaim.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not a common word; it is a historical name from the Old Testament in Genesis 32:2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jacob decided to go back to his fathers land when he could no longer stay with his uncle Laban, to whom he had fled from his brother Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By that time he had four wives and many children, servants, flocks, and herds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, his twin brother Esau was still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jacob was returning with the fear that Esau still wanted to kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As he journeyed with his family, there were no strong ones with him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There were only feeble ones, women and children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jacob was very frightened at the prospect of meeting Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the way the angels of God met him, and Jacob said, This is God s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim Gen 32:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After he saw the two armies of God, Jacob did a marvelous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He divided his wives, children, and the rest of his possessions into two groups, or two armies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He thought that if his brother Esau attacked one group, the other group could escape being slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is full of spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These two groups are not just the singular army of God but two armies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that we are more than conquerors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It also signifies a strong testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God does not want giants.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He wants only the feeble ones, the weaker ones, the women and children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They can become His armies because the fighting is not in their hands but in His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He needs a people who are one with Him, a people who are submissive to Him, signified by the plaited hair S.S. 1:11 , and obedient to Him with a flexible will, signified by the neck with strings of jewels v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we consider how to arrive at the high peak of the revelation in Song of Songs, we should not trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may think that because the apostle Paul was strong, he could do it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the apostle Paul himself told us that he was less than the least among the saints Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He said, Who is weak, and I am not weak?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2 Cor 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All of us, like the seeker in Song of Songs, are country girls.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were not born in a palace but in the countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the country girl to become the Shulammite was Solomon s doing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Solomon attracted, charmed, and captivated her.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Romans 9:16 Paul said, It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may think that we can run, but we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is Christ who can run.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul also said, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Dear saints, when that day comes, all who are strong in themselves will be disqualified.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who are counted as overcomers will be the weaker ones, the ones who wept with tears saying, Lord, I cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank You for releasing all these high-peak truths unveiling to us what we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should be in the Holy of Holies, living within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should be in oneness with You.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are our dwelling place, and we are Your dweller.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I want to attain to this, but I cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am just a little one, a feeble one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such weaker ones who depend on the Lord will be counted worthy to be the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There being two armies indicates that the country girl was not alone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>An army indicates the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Both Tirzah and Jerusalem are buildings, not single pieces of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All these spiritual principles are here.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should humble ourselves and admit that we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead of worrying, we should change our feeling to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can say, Praise You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What a joy that I cannot do anything!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What a joy that You do everything and have done everything for me!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Right away we will have plaited hair and strings of jewels around our neck, that is, submission and obedience to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We will no longer be stiff-necked.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Revelation 3:8 the Lord said that those in Philadelphia had a little power.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He admired their absoluteness and faithfulness to do what they could.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we are too able and too full of capacity in doing things, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today the Lord is waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is still calling for overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we say, Lord, I can t overcome, the Lord will say, My child, whatever you cannot do, I will do for you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I resist the proud, but I give grace to the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the principle of two armies Mahanaim dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Remember that these two armies were composed of Jacob s wives and children.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Eventually, none of them fought against Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It was God who fought Esau by changing his attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Genesis 32 is a history of Mahanaim.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today we are the reality of God s armies Mahanaim .</S>
