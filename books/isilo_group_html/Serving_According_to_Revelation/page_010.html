<h1 class="title">IMPORTANT POINTS<br />
RELATED TO OUR SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING OPINIONS</h2>
<p>Those who serve the Lord must learn to not have opinions. In serving the Lord, we should work and not talk, laboring without opinions. Human opinions are God&rsquo;s enemy. It is dreadful when those who are involved in the service of the church only have opinions and words but cannot labor, sacrifice, and serve.</p>
<p>Serving ones who have never sacrificed often give opinions. Similarly, serving ones who have never labored often suggest methods for doing things. This is not right. In a normal situation there should be labor and service rather than opinions and suggestions. The fewer empty words in our service, the better. Service is not a theoretical matter; it is practical, and we must know how to practically carry out every aspect of the service in order to serve. Only methods that have been tried will be practical.</p>
<p>According to the book of Acts, the service of the apostles was not based on opinions but on labor and sacrifice. As the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones, we need to imitate this. The service of a church is beautiful when many saints labor and sacrifice without expressing opinions. It is disturbing to see a church that is full of opinions and loose talk. Opinions and loose talk issue in death, but labor and sacrifice cause people to touch life.</p>
<p>I often ask saints who offer their opinions or suggestions to practice them. This reduces the problems in the church and helps the saints to learn to labor instead of expressing opinions. For example, when a brother suggested that we dust the lamps in the meeting hall, I responded that it would be good if he could come to the meeting hall once a week to dust. When a sister told me that the saints were sitting too far back in the meeting hall, I said that she should come and sit on the front row. I say such things to help the saints realize that they need to set an example instead of giving opinions. If we see that the lamps in the meeting hall need to be dusted once a week, we should dust them, and if we see that the saints are sitting in the back of the meeting hall, we should take the lead to sit in the front. We should practice, not talk. We should do more and offer fewer opinions. This may seem to be a small point, but it deeply affects the service of the church. We must look to the Lord for His mercy and seek His deliverance from our opinions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING ACCORDING TO A COMMON WAY</h2>
<p>Our service in the church involves coordination with the saints according to a common way. Our personal way of doing things is useless. We must serve according to a common way that is the result of fellowship. In some churches there are hundreds of saints who serve together. If everyone serves according to his own way, our service will be chaotic, nothing will be accomplished, and many saints will stop serving. The services in the church must be carried out according to a common way. This will result in the harmonious coordination of the saints, and the saints will be preserved in the service.</p>
<p>In every church the responsible brothers should spend time to determine the needs related to service. Then the brothers should meet with the saints who are responsible for each service to find a way to carry out that service. The way must be according to the teachings and principles in the Bible. We should never adopt a way that is not according to the Bible. Furthermore, the way to carry out a service must be according to the actual need. It should not involve something idealistic or impractical. After determining a way to carry out different services, we should inform the saints so that their service can be according to the common way that has been fellowshipped by the church, not according to any personal way.</p>
<p>For example, when the methods to handle the affairs related to the church business office have been carefully considered, the deacons must not bring in their own way. There should be a common way to process incoming mail and telephone calls. There should be a common way to respond to reports concerning problems and to requests for prayer. There should be a common way to respond to requests to borrow books and to inquiries concerning the saints. All the affairs of the business office must be handled according to a common, detailed way, not according to anyone&rsquo;s personal way. If every saint has a different way, how can the business office be taken care of properly? We must have a common way when many saints serve together. The brothers bearing responsibility in the churches should learn to serve according to a common way and lead the saints to serve in the same way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Serving According to Revelation &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
