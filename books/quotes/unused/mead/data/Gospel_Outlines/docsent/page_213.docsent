   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Two Hundred Thirteen THE DEEDS OF MAN Scripture: Rom 3:10-18 Man s deeds express his nature What man does is a result of what he is; what he is is based upon his human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since man s nature is evil, so his deeds also are evil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being in such a condition, man needs to realize that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In speaking of man s evil deeds, focus upon the sins mentioned in Romans, plus some others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By this, you should touch people s feeling and cause them to realize that they are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Pick out a few sins such as lying, stealing, and adultery, discussing them thoroughly and severely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First talk about the principle, then illustrate by examples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not touch the deeds of man superficially, but rather dig out the sins that are within him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Depict man s condition when he commits sins; do this in such a way that the audience may have the feeling of sin and be convicted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How to be saved from sins</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Develop this point.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Subject Two Hundred Fourteen THE NEED OF MAN Scripture: John 3:3; Jer 13:23; Heb 9:22 Man s need is based upon his condition</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because man s nature is evil and his behavior is corrupted, there is the need to deal with his evil nature and evil deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man s self-improvement and good behavior Sages and human philosophers throughout the generations have discovered the corrupt situation of man and have often tried their best to help it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The result is that man either tries to correct himself or to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To try to improve oneself is an attempt to make up for the lack in one s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To do good is to try to make up for the failure in one s deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man s self-improvement and good behavior are both useless Self-improvement cannot change the evil nature of man, just as the leopard cannot change his spots and the Ethiopian cannot change his skin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The principle of man s living by good behavior is basically wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because to do good is a fundamental duty or responsibility of a human being, it cannot be regarded as an accomplishment even if a man were to succeed in doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, neither could good behavior hide the sins which may have been committed previously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, it is futile if by doing good a man attempts to erase his sin of having murdered somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man needs a saving way which includes two aspects Man s evil deeds need to be erased.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man needs a salvation whereby his sins may be taken away and the record of them may be erased.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man s evil nature must be replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because his evil nature cannot be corrected or improved, it must be replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s way of salvation The Lord Jesus shed His blood for us and ransomed us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, God s salvation takes care of man s evil deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through this salvation we are regenerated and receive a new life, God s life, which replaces the original evil nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a salvation also takes care of man s evil nature.</S>
