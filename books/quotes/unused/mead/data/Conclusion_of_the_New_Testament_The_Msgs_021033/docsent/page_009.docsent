   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE CHRIST HIS PERSON 3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall cover more aspects of Christ in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Undoubtedly, the last Adam here is Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This last Adam became the life-giving Spirit through the process of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians 15 deals with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection, He is now the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to 1 Corinthians 15:45, the first man Adam became a living soul, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Adam became a living soul through creation with a soulish body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ became a life-giving Spirit through resurrection with a spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Adam as a living soul is natural; Christ as a life-giving Spirit is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, in incarnation He became flesh for redemption John 1:14, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for imparting life John 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, He is ready to be received by His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit to become one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way our spirit is made alive and resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Acts 2:17 and 21 indicate that if we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a matter not of doctrine but of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you consider your experience, you will realize that when you believed in the Lord Jesus, called on Him, and received Him, you received the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Very few Christians have seen that Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some who lack the proper spiritual vision even oppose us when we say, according to the Bible, that Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Andrew Murray, however, understood something concerning this and wrote about it in his masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, in the chapter entitled, The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit of the glorified Jesus is actually the Lord Jesus Himself in resurrection and in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He entered into resurrection, He became the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This life-giving Spirit is the essence to germinate a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The germinating element of the new creation is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Traditional theology opposes the truth that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the opinion of some this is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, it is a truth found in the depths of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First Corinthians 15:45 is a great verse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit in this verse is actually nothing less than Christ, the Triune God, in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now in resurrection He is the life-essence to germinate the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have become the new creation germinated by Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some who oppose the truth that Christ is the life-giving Spirit try to make an issue of the fact that 1 Corinthians 15:45 does not use a definite article before life-giving, that this verse speaks of a life-giving Spirit and not of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the crucial matter here is not whether the article is definite or indefinite; it is the clear mentioning of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The modifier life-giving makes the denotation definite.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ in His resurrection became a Spirit that gives the divine life, the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do the opposers believe that there are two Spirits who give the divine life, the Holy Spirit and the life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is heretical to teach that there are two life-giving Spirits, two Spirits who give life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is truly according to the divine revelation in the Scriptures to say that Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To say that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit is similar to saying, according to John 1:14, that the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Notice that there is no article before the word flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Would it make any difference if this verse said, The Word became the flesh ?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In either case, flesh or the flesh, the meaning is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the same principle, the lack of the definite article is not crucial in 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The vital matter is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Godhead Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
