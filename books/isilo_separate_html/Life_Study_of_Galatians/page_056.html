Baptized into Christ and Putting On Christ</h2><p>We are both sons of Abraham and sons of God because we have been baptized into Christ and have put on Christ (3:27). To believe is to believe into Christ (John 3:16), and to be baptized is to be baptized also into Christ. Faith in Christ brings us into Christ and makes us one with Christ, in whom is the sonship. We must be identified with Christ through faith so that in Him we may be sons of God. By both faith and baptism, we have been immersed into Christ, we have thus put on Christ, and we have become identified with Him.</p><p>Although we all have a natural life with a natural ancestry, we need not live any longer according to that life. Instead, we may live by the divine life with the divine nature. By living according to this life, we are in reality the sons of God and the sons of Abraham. We have been baptized into Christ, the unique seed who has fulfilled God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham. We and Christ have been joined in a marvelous organic union. Because of this union, we are sons of God and sons of Abraham. Here in this organic union we inherit the promise which has been fulfilled by Christ. Actually, Christ Himself is this inheritance. The promise we inherit is the promise we now enjoy.</p><h2 class="head2">E. All One in Christ</h2><p>Galatians 3:28 says, &ldquo;There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Here we see that the sons of Abraham are all one in Christ, without any natural status. In Christ there are no differences among races and nationalities, in social rank, or between the sexes.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Included in Abraham&rsquo;s Only Seed</h2><p>Galatians 3:29 says, &ldquo;And if you are Christ&rsquo;s, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s seed, heirs according to promise.&rdquo; Abraham&rsquo;s seed is only one, Christ (v. 16). Hence, to be Abraham&rsquo;s seed we must be Christ&rsquo;s, a part of Christ. Because we are one with Christ, we are also Abraham&rsquo;s seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God&rsquo;s promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed God to be our portion. Under the New Testament, the believers as God&rsquo;s chosen people, being sons of full age, are such heirs, not under law but in Christ. The Judaizers who remained under law and kept themselves apart from Christ were, like Ishmael (4:23), Abraham&rsquo;s descendants according to flesh, not, like Isaac (4:28), his heirs according to promise. But the believers in Christ are such heirs, inheriting the promised blessing. Hence, we should remain in Christ and not turn to law.</p><p>Since the law is unable to give us life (3:21), it cannot produce the sons of God. But the Spirit that is received by faith (3:2) and that gives us life (2 Cor. 3:6) can produce the sons of God. Law kept God&rsquo;s chosen people under its custody until faith came (3:23). Faith in Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit makes God&rsquo;s chosen people Abraham&rsquo;s seed as &ldquo;the stars of the heavens&rdquo; (Gen. 22:17) according to God&rsquo;s promise.</p><p>Now we are in a position to see a brief sketch of Galatians 3. This chapter reveals that God intended to give the promise to Abraham according to His eternal purpose. Before this promise was accomplished, the law was given to serve as the custodian of God&rsquo;s chosen people. Then, at the appointed time, Christ, the promised seed, came to fulfill God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham. When Christ came, the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s promised blessing also came. This is grace. Hence, grace came with Christ and with the fulfillment. All this is on God&rsquo;s side. On our side, we need a way to apprehend, realize, and grasp all that Christ, the seed, has accomplished. In other words, we need a spiritual camera to photograph the scenery of grace. This &ldquo;camera&rdquo; is our faith. Therefore, with the coming of grace on God&rsquo;s side, there is also the coming of faith on our side. Now that we have grace, faith, and the seed which has fulfilled the promise, we no longer need the law to serve as our custodian. Hence, the law should be set aside. It should no longer have any place in the scenery. We must turn from the law, the custodian, and stay with Christ, the One who has fulfilled the promise. Of course, this means we should also stay with grace and faith. Then we shall be included in Christ, the unique seed, to inherit the fulfilled promise and to enjoy the blessing of the promise to Abraham. This blessing is the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> </body></html>
