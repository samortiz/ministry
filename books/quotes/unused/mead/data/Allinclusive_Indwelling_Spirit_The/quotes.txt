[1]  The All-inclusive Spirit Indwelling the Believers as Their Life Supply
[2]  The All-inclusive Spirit Supplying the Believers with Life to Conform Them to the Image of the Firstborn Son of God
[3]  AS THEIR LIFE SUPPLY Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 6, 9-11 ROMANS 8 BEING THE MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES
[4]  The Bible is a book of mystery, containing at least five main mysteries God, the universe, man, the church, and the future.
[5]  The Spirit is not only life and the law of the Spirit of life, but He is also God v. 9 . We need to see that God in Romans 8 includes more than God in Genesis 1.
[6]  In Genesis 1:1 God did not have the human nature, for He had not yet become a man or lived a human life, nor had He passed through death and entered into resurrection and ascension.
[7]  Traditional systematic theology says that God is ever the same, that God never changes from eternity to eternity.
[8]  In resurrection God in Christ underwent another change He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .
[9]  We do not need to try to behave properly or improve our conduct; instead, we only need to take care of the indwelling Spirit, who is God, Christ, the automatically functioning law of the Spirit of life, our life, and our life supply.
[10]  If we keep ourselves open, we will receive the injection, transfusion, and supplying of the Spirit, who is God, Christ, the resurrecting One, the law of the Spirit of life, the life, and the life supply.
[11]  We need to forget about all such religious things and simply say, Lord, I thank You that You have been installed in me as the all-inclusive Spirit, who is God, Christ, the resurrecting One, life, and the law of the Spirit of life, so that I can enjoy and experience You.
[12]  OF THE FIRSTBORN SON OF GOD Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 6, 10-11, 29 ROMANS 8 BEING THE FOCUS OF THE BIBLE
[13]  The Bible begins in Genesis by revealing that God, according to His eternal plan, created the heavens and the earth so that man could exist to fulfill God s eternal purpose and desire, which is to impart Himself into His chosen people as their life supply so that they could become His expression 1:1, 26; 2:9, 16 .
[14]  The purpose of the all-inclusive Spirit being life to our spirit, mind, and body is revealed in verse 29, which says, Those whom He God foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.
[15]  Before the foundation of the world, God knew each one of us and loved us in spite of our flaws, defects, and sinfulness.
[16]  God made our spirit life at regeneration and is now making our mind life and even working life into our body for His purpose to conform us fallen sinners to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God.
[17]  If we live according to nature, culture, habits, ethics, or religion, we are neglecting the Spirit of life, the law of the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One, and we are missing the Spirit being life to our spirit, mind, and body.
[18]  This Spirit is now infusing life into our entire being from our spirit into our mind, the leading part of our soul, and eventually into our entire body resurrecting, renewing, transforming, and conforming us to the glorious image of the firstborn Son of God, Jesus Christ, who is both the Son of God and the Son of Man.
[19]  One principle concerning life is that it is invisible.
[20]  For instance, we may say that our physical life is in our body, but we could not point to its specific location, even if we could see inside our body.
[21]  FOR THEIR LIVING Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 6, 10-11, 29 THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT
[22]  Romans 8 concerns the all-inclusive Spirit giving life to our three parts for the goal of conforming us to the image of the firstborn Son of God.
[23]  Romans 8:2 says, The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.
[24]  In the original Greek text it is difficult to discern whether the phrase in Christ Jesus modifies the law of the Spirit of life or has freed me.
[25]  Actually, the law of the Spirit of life and the freeing are both in Christ Jesus.
[26]  CHAPTER FOUR THE WAY TO LIVE BY THE DIVINE LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 8:4-5, 13-15 LIVING A GRAFTED LIFE
[27]  The New Testament reveals the way for us to enter into the reality of God s economy.
[28]  In order to see how to live by the divine life, we first need to realize that God desires to be one with man.
[29]  Romans 8:5 says, Those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit.
[30]  The verb in verse 4 is walk, but the verb in verse 5 is are .
[31]  Being according to the flesh or the spirit implies more than walking according to the flesh or the spirit.
[32]  We need to not only walk according to the spirit but also constantly be according to the spirit, not according to the flesh.
[33]  A living according to the spirit and not according to the flesh is the realization of an inward law the law of the Spirit of life v. 2 . The law of gravity keeps us on the ground.
[34]  CHAPTER FIVE THE SPIRIT OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD INDWELLING THE BELIEVERS
[35]  TO RESURRECT EVERY PART OF THEIR BEING Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 9-11 THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE
[36]  Verse 2 mentions the law of the Spirit of life.
[37]  Life in this verse is not our physical life but God s eternal life, the divine life, which is the highest and richest life.
[38]  We need to see that the indwelling Spirit is the Triune God.
[39]  Thus, our spirit is life v. 10 . When we love the Lord and set our mind on the things concerning Him, our mind is life v. 6 . Furthermore, if the Spirit of the resurrecting One indwells us, He will give life to our body v. 11 . For the Spirit to indwell us, we must give Him the permission to settle within us and saturate our inner being.
[40]  Ephesians 1:3-5 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ...even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.
[41]  Man can become God s expression only by God entering into man to be man s life and content and to make man one with Him so that man may live by Him and even live Him out.
[42]  Today God has passed through His work of creation, incarnation, human living, and His redemptive death.
[43]  He has entered into resurrection and ascension, in which He has been enthroned, crowned, and glorified.
[44]  Since God has accomplished all this, He is no longer merely God the Creator, as in Genesis 1, not yet having passed through all His processes.
[45]  Although we may not recall every point that we have read in these chapters, we need to at least remember the good news that we live in an age in which the Triune God is fully processed, has accomplished everything, and is the applicable God as the life-giving Spirit.
[46]  OF GOD S ECONOMY IN ROMANS 8 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 4-6, 9, 11-13 GOD DESIRING TO WORK HIMSELF INTO US AS LIFE
[47]  Because the book of Romans is mysterious and abstract, through the years many Bible teachers have not touched it adequately.
[48]  We need to realize that according to God s economy and eternal purpose, what God wants to do in His salvation is to work Himself into us, His redeemed people, as our life.
[49]  Romans 8 reveals that the law of the Spirit of life and the all-inclusive Spirit reside in our spirit.
[50]  When we walk and are according to the spirit, we will mind the things of the Spirit v. 5 . To mind the things of the Spirit is to set our mind on the things of the Spirit, that is, to always have our mind occupied with the things of the Spirit, which are the things concerning Christ.
[51]  From the beginning of the day, our mind should be fully occupied with the things concerning Christ, such as His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit who now indwells us.
[52]  We need to realize that because we have the law of the Spirit of life and the all-inclusive Spirit in us, we do not have to be in the flesh or do things according to the flesh.
[53]  To live according to our old habits is altogether versus the revelation in Romans 8 that the law of the Spirit of life is operating within us and that the all-inclusive Spirit is within us as our life and our person.
[54]  To live according to our old habits is versus God s economy, which is to work Himself into our being and become one with us so that we may take Him as our life and our person, walk according to Him, and be absolutely according to Him.
