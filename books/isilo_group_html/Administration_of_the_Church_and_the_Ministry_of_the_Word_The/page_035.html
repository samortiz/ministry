<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
REQUIRING KNOWLEDGE OF<br />
DIFFERENT MATTERS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING MATTERS</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider different matters that we should know. For the building up of the church, we must know people and different matters. If we simply want to be zealous ones who preach the gospel to save sinners and speak the truth to perfect the saints, there is no need for us to have a knowledge concerning various matters. However, in order to build up the church, we should know people and matters. We need to know those whom we contact and those who desire to serve the Lord. We need to know their motives, whether their flesh has been dealt with, and their spirit. We also need to know the nature, outcome, relationship, and impact of these matters.</p>
<p>There are many aspects of the things we need to know. For example, a brother who loves the Lord may say that the Lord has moved him to give ten thousand dollars to the church. On the one hand, we should thank the Lord and rejoice that this brother is willing to be used in this way by the Lord. On the other hand, we should realize that this is not a simple matter. We need to have some understanding related to the matter of giving. This means that we should understand the motive, nature, method, and purpose of the brother&rsquo;s giving. We also need to know the possible results and influence of his offering. If we simply thank the Lord and accept the offering, our work is not for the building up of the church; rather, it will tear down the church.</p>
<p>We must seek to be enlightened by the Lord through prayer and consideration in order to examine the history and background of the person who is giving the gift. We should consider his reputation and standing in society and the source of the money he is offering. We should also consider his intentions before the Lord and the spirit of his giving. When the elders receive a large sum of money as a gift to the church, they must take the time to understand how such a large sum of money was obtained. Moreover, they must seriously consider the potential effect, directly or indirectly, of the offering. In other words, the elders need a basic knowledge concerning this matter.</p>
<p>Suppose another brother says that he wants to offer fifty thousand dollars to help the brothers in poverty. Although this is good, it is not so simple. We should not simply thank the Lord for this brother, thinking that this is a timely offering to help the saints in need. We should not think that simply by distributing the fifty thousand dollars to the poor the church will be built up. On the contrary, we need to consider whether the offering can cause the church to be torn down. This can be compared to a surgery that causes a person to lose his life instead of healing him or to food that causes a person to become sick rather than nourishing him. In order to build up the church, we should not be simple persons. We need to learn to fully understand the situation we are facing. Then we can determine what we should do and how we should do it.</p>
<p>Discerning matters is related not only to the administration of the church but even to the ministry of the word. We may give a message to discourage instead of a message to encourage if we lack knowledge concerning a certain matter. Hence, if we want to learn to build up the church, we must learn to discern matters. We must learn to know every matter that is directly or indirectly related to the church, as long as it is something we can inquire into and something we can touch. Our ability to administrate the church depends on whether we are able to know people and matters. Our ability to preach the word and work for the Lord depends on whether we know people and matters. Even our ability to visit and help people depends on such knowledge.</p>
<p>Some responsible brothers act inappropriately in the administration of the church because they are short of knowledge concerning different matters. Some messages may edify the saints but result in tearing down rather than building up. This is the result of an inadequate knowledge concerning matters. A lack of knowledge can also cause us to tear down the church while we are building it up.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Ministry of the Word &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
