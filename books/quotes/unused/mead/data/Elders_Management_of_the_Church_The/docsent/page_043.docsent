   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SUBMITTING TO AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once a person encounters authority, he cannot help but submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is useless to have a thousand arguments that are right.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only through submission can one have life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only through submission can one live.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only through submission can there be blessing, and only through submission is there a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Keep in mind that we are not speaking about the matter of obedience, but submission.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have seen some children who acted according to their parents' desire, yet they were not at all submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They did what their parents said, but there was no inward submission.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have also seen the opposite: some children are not at all acting according to their parents' desire, yet they are full of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In some cases, you may have conflict with authority and may find that you cannot obey, but your spirit is still one of submission, as is your attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In still other cases, you may be acting in obedience to authority, yet in reality there is no submission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What we are talking about here is not the question of obedience, but the question of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That which we obey may not be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only that which we submit to is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not have the misconception that submission to authority means that you are obligated to do even things that are wrong; this is not true!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even when you find the authority proposing something that is wrong, you can still submit, without doing the thing that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not a question of obedience, but altogether a question of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every elder must be aware of this fact; he must be full of a spirit of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only then will a spirit of submission prevail throughout the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the whole church lacks a spirit of submission, the elders are responsible for this lack.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An unsubmissive person will only bring forth an unsubmissive church; he will never be able to bring forth a submissive church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may say that the Lord is our only Head.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, you and I must learn to touch something called authority and to submit to this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only then can we bring into the church an atmosphere and a spirit of submission, and only then will the church have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, there will be no way to go on: You can boast about your ability or capability, but be prepared that one day the whole church will have an unsubmissive spirit towards you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only those who are submissive can bring forth the spirit of submission, and only they can bring forth a submissive church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To obey is one thing, and to submit is another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise God, throughout the Bible these two terms are used in our relationship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to submit to God and to obey Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible does not say that the wife should obey the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the Bible told the wife to obey the husband, that would be terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some husbands demand that their wives worship idols with them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Should the wives obey?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course not!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible only charges us to submit to those who are in authority; it never requires us to obey them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If God had charged us to obey those in authority, that would be terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>King Nebuchadnezzar commanded Daniel's three friends to worship the image.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If they were to obey him, that would have been terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God says to submit, yet they could not worship the image, nor could they obey the king's command.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the same time, they should still submit to the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here was an authority which they had to come under.</S>
