   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TEST OF THE HERETICAL TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CONCERNING CIRCUMCISION AS A REQUIREMENT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FOR SALVATION ACTS 15:1-31</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Judaizers, the Jewish believers, not only stressed the practice of circumcision, but also said that circumcision was a requirement for salvation v. 1 . This was a great heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No little dissension and discussion arose between the Judaic believers and those of the proper faith vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This problem was solved by Paul and Barnabas and certain others among the believers going to Jerusalem from Antioch to have a conference with the apostles and the elders there v. 2 . The Bible shows us that when a question like this arises, the leading ones need to come together to have a conference, to bring everything out into the open.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The problem in Acts 15 was solved by Paul and Barnabas going to Jerusalem, having a conference with the apostles and the elders there, and through thorough fellowship, working out a solution that satisfied all the believers in different localities, a solution over which all the churches rejoiced and by which they were comforted vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2, 6-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the way we should solve the problems among us today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that if from the beginning the concerned brothers among us would have had a sincere heart with a pure motive to come together to pray, to study the Word, and to fellowship, their concerns would have been easily taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, until now the brothers have been avoiding this kind of necessary fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE TEST OF A SHARP CONTENTION BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE TWO CO-WORKERS, PAUL AND BARNABAS,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CONCERNING TAKING MARK ALONG WITH THEM</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>ACTS 15:36-40</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul proposed that he and Barnabas return to the places where they had worked and visit the brothers there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Barnabas intended to take Mark with them, but Paul did not consider it suitable vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>36-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In their contending, both of them were frank, honest, and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in these past two years I have not seen such frankness, honesty, and faithfulness with those who instigated the present turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The contention among Paul and Barnabas, with no way to resolve it, resulted in a separation between the two co-workers vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This separation might not be considered a practical division, but it was surely a strong discord that seriously damaged the genuine oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no record that the problem between Paul and Barnabas was ever resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>V. THE TEST OF THOSE WHO MAKE DIVISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>AND CAUSES OF FALLING CONTRARY TO</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE APOSTLES TEACHING, DECEIVING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BY SMOOTH AND FLATTERING SPEECH ROM.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>16:17-18</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am comforted that Paul put such an item at the end of Romans, which is a book revealing how we sinners can be regenerated and transformed into mature sons of God that we may be the constituents of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is surely wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, even among the churches established by Paul, there were those who made divisions and causes of falling, deceiving people by smooth and flattering speech to draw away the believers to follow after them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul told the saints that they had to keep a watchful eye on such persons and turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul did not say that because these persons were pitiful, the saints should show them love and sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such persons damage the Body and offend Christ, the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, Paul did not tell the saints to express their love to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, he exhorted them to keep a watchful eye on divisive persons of this kind and to turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord s recovery has been in the United States for over a quarter of a century.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such a thing as is described in Romans 16:17-18 has never taken place in the recovery in as serious a way as today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What has been going on among us and is still going on is exactly what is mentioned in Romans 16.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Among us there are those who are making divisions and causing people to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As the Apostle Paul warned in Acts 20:30, these are perverted persons who speak perverted things to draw people away from the church to be their following.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Acts 20 Paul did not tell the believers to turn away from such persons, but in Romans 16, Paul did say that we should turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This turning away is to exercise to quarantine the divisive, sectarian ones in order to protect the saints from being contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The divisive ones are very contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Anyone who contacts them will be infected.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This would not be good for them or for others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, today we should carry out what is termed in medicine a quarantine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To quarantine a person does not mean that we do not love him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the contrary, it means that we love both him and many others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If one member of a family contracts a contagious disease, the whole family may need to quarantine him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is for the benefit of all the members of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To cut people off, to excommunicate people, was the practice of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From the beginning of the Lord s recovery we realized that was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, to quarantine those who are sick with a contagious spiritual disease certainly is scriptural.</S>
