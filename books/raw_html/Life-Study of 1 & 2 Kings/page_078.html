<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE REIGN OF JEHOASH (JOASH) OVER ISRAEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Reigning in Samaria for Sixteen Years</H2><P>Jehoash began to reign in the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah and reigned in Samaria for sixteen years (vv. 9b-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Doing Evil in the Sight of Jehovah</H2><P>Jehoash did evil in the sight of Jehovah and did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, by which he caused Israel to sin but walked in them (v. 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Glorious Ending<br>of Elisha's Life and Ministry</H2><P>Verses 14 through 21 tell us of the glorious ending of Elisha's life and ministry. Elisha was a wonderful type of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not Being Healed by a Miracle</H2><P>Elisha performed miracles of divine healing for others, but, in the will of God, he himself was not healed by a miracle (v. 14a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Recognized by Joash King of Israel<br>as the Chariots and Horsemen of Israel</H2><P>Elisha was recognized by Joash king of Israel as the chariots and horsemen of Israel (v. 14b). This means that he was recognized as the national defense of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Prophesying to Joash by the Parable<br>of the Shooting and Striking of Arrows</H2><P>Elisha prophesied to Joash by the parable of the shooting and striking of arrows that Joash would defeat the Syrians and consume them three times (vv. 15-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Deceasing in the Body<br>yet Still Ministering in the Spirit</H2><P>Elisha deceased in his body yet still ministered in the spirit to enliven one of the dead (vv. 20-21). When he died his body was buried in a tomb. One day a man was killed, and his body was cast into the tomb of Elisha. When the body touched Elisha's body, the man was enlivened. Even the dead Elisha could enliven people. This is a picture of Christ in resurrection. Whoever touches Him is enlivened. D. L. Moody once said that the greatest miracle is regeneration. Regeneration involves a spiritually dead people touching the dead and resurrected Christ. Whoever touches this Christ is regenerated, enlivened. I can testify that sixty-nine years ago I touched Him and was enlivened and became an altogether different person. Ever since, Christ's enlivening life has kept me in His hand.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Recovering Cities<br>out of the Hand of Ben-hadad</H2><P>By his threefold victory over the Syrians, Jehoash recovered the cities out of the hand of Ben-hadad which Ben-hadad had taken in war out of the hand of Jehoahaz (v. 25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Buried in Samaria with the Kings of Israel</H2><P>Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. He was succeeded by his son Jeroboam (vv. 12-13; 14:15-16).</P>
