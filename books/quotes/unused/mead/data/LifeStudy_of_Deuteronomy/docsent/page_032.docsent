   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GENERAL ADVICES AND WARNINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Deuteronomy 5:32 13:18 is a long section dealing with the general advices and warnings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of his burden, concern, and love, Moses spoke here in a detailed, repetitious way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Keeping the Commandments,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Statutes, and Judgments of God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 6:1-3 Moses charged the children of Israel to keep the commandments, statutes, and judgments of God that they may live long, that it may go well with them, and that they may be greatly increased in the land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The statutes are supplementary items of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a judgment is added to a statute, the statute becomes an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whereas the children of Israel were charged to keep the commandments, statutes, and judgments, we today need to keep Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Loving Jehovah Their God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>and Keeping, Teaching, and Writing His Words</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 6:4-9 Moses went on to speak of loving Jehovah their God with all their heart, with all their soul, and with all their might, of keeping God's words upon their heart, teaching them diligently to their children, binding them on their hand as a sign, wearing them as frontlets between their eyes, and writing them on the doorposts of their house and on their gates.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we need to love Christ, keep Christ, teach Christ, wear Christ, and write Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Remembering Jehovah, Fearing Him,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Serving Him, and Not Going After Other Gods</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verses 10 through 12 say, "When Jehovah your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob, to give you great and fine cities that you did not build, and houses full of all good things that you did not fill, and hewn cisterns that you did not hew, vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant, and you have eaten and are satisfied; be careful lest you forget Jehovah who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moses was concerned that in their enjoyment the people would forget Jehovah their God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, in verses 13 through 15 he went on to charge them to fear Jehovah, to serve Him, and not to go after other gods to provoke the anger of their God, who is a jealous God.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Which Is Right and Good in His Sight</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verses 16 through 19 we have a further expression of Moses' concern.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here he charged the children of Israel not to test Jehovah their God, to diligently keep His commandments, testimonies, and statutes, and to do that which is right and good in His sight, so that it might go well with them and they might enter and possess the good land which He promised them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>E. Telling Them What to Say</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>to the Son Who Asks about the Significance</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>of the Testimonies, Statutes, and Judgments</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verses 20 through 25 Moses told the people what to say to the son who asks about the significance of the testimonies, statutes, and judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They were to tell him that they were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt, that Jehovah brought them out of Egypt with a mighty hand in order to bring them into the promised land, and that Jehovah commanded them to keep His testimonies, statutes, and judgments, so that they would fear Him for their good and He would preserve them alive and so that it would be righteousness to them.</S>
