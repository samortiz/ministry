   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN ASPECTS OF WHAT CHRIST IS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ s person is wonderful, profound, and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His Person has two aspects, the divine aspect and the human aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In theology the study of Christ s Person is known as Christology.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since the second century, Christian teachers have argued concerning the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Due to the different teachings and opinions, the argument regarding the Person of Christ has gone on and on, even until today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we must be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we follow a teaching regarding Christ s Person that is not according to the Bible, we shall be in difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not be influenced by any teaching concerning Christ s Person that is not according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE IMPOSSIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>OF UNDERSTANDING CHRIST FULLY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I beg you to come back to the Bible and not try to analyze Christ or to understand Him according to your mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We simply cannot understand Him fully.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In fact, we cannot even understand ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Can you tell me where your mind is located?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, do you realize that you have two hearts, a physical heart and a psychological heart?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You can locate your physical heart, but can you locate your psychological heart?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where is it?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all should answer, I don t know.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you would know the Bible, you must learn to say, I don t know.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible reveals that we have a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you know where your soul is?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And what about your spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you know where it is?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all have a spirit, a soul, a heart, a mind, an emotion, and a will, but we are not able to locate them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition to all this, and most mysterious of all, there is the matter of our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you understand your physical life?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not even medical doctors know what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, how could we expect to understand all there is of Christ when we cannot even understand ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The matter of eating also illustrates how limited our mind is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you know everything about the food you eat?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you did not eat until you adequately understood what you were eating, you would die of starvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Day after day, we eat our food without trying to analyze it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not interested in understanding the food I eat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In my travels throughout the world, I have stayed in homes in many different countries in the Far East, Europe, South America, and the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because my hosts have lovingly taken care of me, they served me the best food.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As they served me, they have often attempted to explain the food to me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, I said to myself, Please, simply serve me the food.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not try to explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no room in my mind for all this information.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please stop talking and let me enjoy the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because you love me, I know that you have prepared the best food for me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am assured that you would never serve something that was bad for me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I prefer to enjoy my food ignorantly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, the more you study, the less you will enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the less you study, the more food you will enjoy and the better you will digest it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>EATING THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may apply this matter in coming to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not sufficient just to study the Bible; we have to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jeremiah 15:16 says, Thy words were found, and I did eat them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In resisting the temptation of the devil, the Lord Jesus said, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you come to the breakfast table, do you study the food or do you eat it?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No one would be so foolish as to study it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, most Christians do not eat the Word of God when they open their Bibles; they merely study it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Too much study without eating may damage you; many have been damaged in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One day I began to read the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I was puzzled by the first phrase, In the beginning, and I began to study it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I asked myself, The beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What kind of beginning is this?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I stopped eating and began studying.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I checked the marginal references, and then I consulted a concordance and a dictionary to find the meaning of the phrase, In the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I simply was not able to understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead of eating the meat of the chicken, I studied the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But it was too much for my teeth to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nevertheless, I went on to study further and to ask more questions concerning what the Word was and how the Word could be both with God and God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It seemed to me that it was not logical to say that the Word both was God and was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I wondered if the Word and God were one or two.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After many years, the Lord showed me that the way is not to study, but to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After having learned this way, I came again to John 1:1 and began to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I prayed with this verse, saying, In the beginning, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Oh, the beginning!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Oh, the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>And the Word was with God!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>And the Word was God!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hallelujah for the beginning!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hallelujah for the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Hallelujah for God!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this way, I had a rich breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you are troubled over the matter that the Son is called the everlasting Father, I suggest that you eat Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Eat the verse by saying, For unto us!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Oh, unto me, unto you, unto us!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A child is born!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Not taught, but born!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hallelujah, a Son is given!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Not a teacher, but a Son!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>And the government shall be upon His shoulder!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>And His name!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Hallelujah for His name!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>His name shall be called wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Oh, His name is counselor!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What rich food this is!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He is the counselor!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Praise Him, He is the mighty God!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>A child is the mighty God!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>His name is called the everlasting Father!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Hallelujah, the Son is the Father!</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>After you eat this verse, you will still not understand it fully, but you will be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Some say that they do not like pray-reading because it is too noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If you do not like the noise, exercise your table manners and eat quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>However, those who take care of their manners usually do not enjoy eating very much.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Nevertheless, even when you observe the proper table manners, eating is still superior to studying.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The principle here is not to trust in our limited mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The spiritual mysteries are always revealed to our spirit, not to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>As you are pray-reading the Word, open your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Do not exercise your mentality exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Then the Holy Spirit will shine into you and reveal the depth of the truth into your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In this way, you will receive revelation instead of mere knowledge.</S>
