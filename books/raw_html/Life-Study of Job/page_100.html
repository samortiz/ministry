<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE COMPLETED DIVINE REVELATION<br>IN THE ENTIRE SCRIPTURES<br>CONCERNING GOD'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26-27; 2:9-12</H1><P>We need to see the completed divine revelation in the entire Scriptures concerning God's relationship with man. Seeing this revelation will help us to understand the book of Job. In this message we will cover the first three sections of this revelation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. FROM GOD'S CREATION OF MAN<br>TO THE CALLING OF ABRAHAM</H2><P>God's relationship with man in the Scriptures includes the dispensation, the section of time, before the law, part of which is the time from God's creation of man to the calling of Abraham.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God Creating Man<br>and Wanting Man to Take Him as Life</H2><P>God created man and wanted man to take Him as life that man might express Him, be transformed into precious materials for His building, and be built up to be His counterpart to match Him (Gen. 1:26-27; 2:9-12, 18-24). God took a rib out of Adam and built it up into a woman to match Adam to be his counterpart. This is a type showing how God in Christ is the Husband, needing a match, a counterpart. Therefore, in the fulfillment of this type, something came out of Christ&#151;the divine life&#151;to become the church, which is the bride to match Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. After Man Became Fallen,<br>God Promising the Fallen Man<br>That Christ Would Come as the Seed of Woman</H2><P>After man became fallen, God promised the fallen man that Christ would come as the seed of woman to destroy the "serpent," Satan, for man and to redeem and justify man with the shed blood and the coats of the skins of the sacrifice, typifying Christ (3:8-9, 15, 21). These things are a part of God's relationship with us.</P>
