[2]  CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT THE MAN OF GOD AND THE OLD PROPHET Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 13:1-32
[3]  The story recorded in 1 Kings 13 is a sobering story; it is also a tragic story.
[4]  Both men were used by God, but both had a tragic ending.
[5]  But He did not ask the old prophet in Bethel to speak for Him; instead, He sent the man of God from Judah to speak for Him.
[6]  The Lord charged the man of God saying, "Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest" 1 Kings 13:9 .
[7]  The man of God remembered this charge and rejected the offer of the king.
[8]  Yet he was deceived when the old prophet said, "I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water" v. 18 . He thought that the old prophet was more experienced than he, and he thought that he should listen to him.
[9]  CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE THE WORK OF GOD Scripture Reading: John 6:28-29; Eph 2:10; Gal 1:11-12, 16; 1 Cor 3:9-15 MAN CANNOT WORK THE WORKS OF GOD
[10]  In John 6:28 a group of people asked the Lord Jesus what they should do that they might work the works of God.
[11]  They were zealous for God and wanted to do God's work.
[12]  But they did not know what it was to work the works of God.
[13]  The Lord said, "This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He has sent" v. 29 . While man boasted of what he could do, the Lord replied that man ought to believe.
[14]  Why did Paul say, "For we are God's fellow workers" 1 Cor 3:9 ?
[15]  He asked the Corinthian believers, "Are you not my work in the Lord?"
[16]  First Corinthians 3 shows us that God is the Lord of the work and that all the workers are under His direction.
[17]  Paul told us in Galatians that the word he preached was according to revelation because it pleased God to reveal His Son in him.
[18]  First Corinthians 3:12 tells us that the working material of some people is gold, silver, and precious stones, while the working material of other people is wood, grass, and stubble.
[19]  The day will come and reveal everything by fire; the fire will prove of what sort is each one's work.
[20]  We know that wood, grass, and stubble do not remain once they are burned.
[21]  The precious stones signify the work of the Holy Spirit, which is the Holy Spirit's constitution of the life of God in man through revelation, blending God and man into one.
[22]  God reveals Himself within man's center, his spirit, then extends to his soul, enlightening his mind, and finally directs his body to execute His will.
[23]  This holy God is joined to our spirit through the Holy Spirit we become one spirit with the Lord .
[24]  Those who listen to the word should also take care of a few things.
[25]  CHAPTER FORTY LEARNING THE LESSONS IN OUR SERVICE Scripture Reading: Rom 7:6; 12:1; Exo 40:17-33
[26]  In learning to serve the Lord in the church, we should be faithful in practical affairs, but our attention should always focus on the increase of the measure of spirituality.
[27]  The purpose of taking care of business affairs is to dispense spiritual matters to others.
[28]  If we only have the business side but are short on the spiritual side, we have deviated from the main focus of our service to the Lord.
[29]  If we visit someone who confesses that he does not come to the meetings because his temper is too rash and if we rebuke him as soon as we hear this, it means that we do not have a feeling about our own quick temper, and our service will not carry any spiritual weight.
[30]  Although He can act as He pleases, He does not act recklessly; He acts according to His preordained laws and principles.
[31]  When God created man, He gave man a free will, so that now there are three wills in the universe.
[32]  Man wonders why God would not destroy Satan quickly.
[33]  We do not fully understand, but we know that God wants to do it this way.
[34]  Hence, when we pray, we are not asking God to do what He does not want to do, and we are not asking Him to change His will.
[35]  How should we lay the tracks for God's will?
[36]  Ephesians 6:18 says, "By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance."
[37]  If you only pray a few words for him and ask only that God bless him, protect him, and supply him, this prayer-net is too loose.
[38]  CHAPTER FORTY-TWO WATCH AND BE SOBER Scripture Reading: Matt 22:23-29; 1 Thes 5:6
[39]  The Sadducees who did not believe in resurrection came to the Lord Jesus one day and asked, "Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.
[40]  I believe that the Lord Jesus healed the sick and cast out demons.
[41]  He is the Son of God, and it is a natural thing for Him to perform miracles.
[42]  But the Bible does not tell us the day the Lord will come.
[43]  Ecclesiastes tells us that when we pray to God, we must not be rash with our mouth or let our heart be hasty to utter any thing before God 5:2 .
[44]  If we do not search the Scriptures carefully, if we do not take the Bible as the lamp to our feet and light for our path, if we do not submit to the authority of the Spirit in fear and trembling, watching and praying at all times, and if we do not have a fear of falling into error, we are indeed in poverty and darkness!
[45]  CHAPTER FORTY-THREE MIRACLES ARE SPONTANEOUS Scripture Reading: Mark 16:17-18; Psa 72:18
[46]  In Mark 16:17-18 the Lord Jesus spoke to the eleven disciples.
[47]  He said, "And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well."
[48]  But God will not vindicate them; He will not prove Himself to them because He is God.
[49]  Hence, there is no need for anyone to struggle to perform miracles.
[50]  When God's power is manifested in us, there are miracles.
[51]  Brothers and sisters, when God answers your prayer and you feel that you have done something marvelous, it proves that your faith is very immature.
[52]  Many of God's children live in poverty because they have not allowed the word of God to dwell in them richly, as Colossians tells us to do.
[53]  The first cause of spiritual poverty or the first step toward spiritual poverty among Christians is poverty in the Word of God.
[54]  A man who is poor in the eyes of God may read through the Bible page by page and chapter by chapter, but he will not know God's Word.
[55]  He has not made any contact with God and he does not find any life in the Word.
[56]  Reading it through sequentially from beginning to end is only one way of reading it.
[57]  There is another way of reading, which a Christian should practice as soon as he begins his Christian life.
[58]  Colossians 3:16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom."
[59]  We have to let the Word dwell in us.
[60]  We should not only memorize it, but we should also digest it into our heart.
[61]  The Lord taught us to pray for God to give us this day our daily food.
[62]  Therefore, we must pray for God to give us not only physical food but also spiritual food and to teach us the way to eat this food so that we can store the word in our heart.
[63]  CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE NUMBERING OUR DAYS Scripture Reading: Psa 90:12; Eph 5:16-17; Joel 2:25
[64]  Editor's Note: The following article was printed in the Chinese edition of Twelve Baskets Full, Volume 5, chapter twelve.
[65]  It is similar in content to the article "The Numbering of Spiritual Days" published in Issue No. 47 of Notes on Scriptural Messages and reprinted in The Collected Works, Volume 19.
[66]  In the Psalms, Moses prayed to God, "Teach us then to number our days/That we may gain a heart of wisdom."
[67]  How many years were there from the time the Israelites left Egypt to the time of the building of Solomon's temple?
[68]  Acts 13:18-22 says, "And for a time of about forty years He carried them as a nurse in the wilderness.
[69]  And afterward they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
[70]  We must not think that the days we have lost are a few, unimportant days.
[71]  If we consider the journey the Israelites took in the wilderness, we will realize how serious it is to waste our days.
[72]  The Lord spoke a parable in Matthew 20 concerning a householder looking for workmen for his vineyard.
[73]  We have to pay attention to two words, "standing idle."
[74]  This parable shows us that God does not want us to be idle; He wants us to work.
[75]  CHAPTER FORTY-SIX THE TESTIMONY OF GOD Scripture Reading: Psa 119:125 GOD'S TESTIMONY BEING
[76]  What actually is the testimony of God, and what does it refer to?
[77]  In order to testify of Himself, He came among men and declared what He is.
[78]  We can recite one, ten, or a hundred speeches concerning God, but we must realize that the testimony is not given by man; the testimony is what God tells us about Himself.
[79]  There are a few sobering cases in the Old Testament.
[80]  In Numbers 20, Moses smote the rock at Meribah, and God forbade him from entering Canaan.
[81]  Although Moses later pleaded, "Let me please cross over" Deut 3:25 , God would not answer his pleading.
[82]  When God said that he could not enter Canaan, it meant that he could not enter it.
[83]  God often disciplines His children for the purpose of vindicating Himself.
[84]  God wants to let men, as well as the devil, know that He has no part in a certain matter, that it is something done by man himself.
[85]  CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN THE TESTIMONY OF THE LORD JESUS
[86]  AND PONTIUS PILATE Scripture Reading: Matt 26:57-66; 27:1-2, 11, 18; John 18:28-40; 19:7-8, 12, 15 ONE
[87]  On the night the Lord Jesus was betrayed, He was seized and taken to Caiaphas the high priest.
[88]  But when the high priest asked, "I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God," He answered, "You have said rightly."
[89]  In the morning, they brought the Lord Jesus before Pilate the governor, and Pilate asked the Lord, "You are the King of the Jews?"
[90]  Jesus answered, "Are you saying this of yourself, or did others tell you about Me?"
[91]  The book of Revelation speaks of "the testimony of Jesus" several times.
[92]  The apostle John was exiled to the island of Patmos for "the testimony of Jesus" 1:9 .
[93]  In the end they do not acknowledge that Christ is God and do not want others to acknowledge that Christ is God.
[94]  The most important thing in our spiritual work is a knowledge of the "pattern on the mount."
[95]  In our spiritual work, many things are important, and if we come short in any of them, our work will lose its spiritual usefulness and not please God.
[96]  The glory of a servant of Christ does not lie in his ability to come up with new designs for God but in his faithfulness in carrying out the will of God as he understands it.
[97]  Psalm 19:13 says, "Keep Your servant from presumptuous sins;/Do not let them have dominion over me;/Then I will be blameless and cleared/Of great transgression."
[98]  This tells us that God's servants have two kinds of sins before Him.
[99]  If you do not do what God wants you to do, this is the sin of rebellion.
[100]  Rebellion is to refuse to do what God commands us to do, whereas presumptuousness is to do what God has not commanded us to do.
[101]  If God has not commanded you to do something, yet you do it according to your own will, you have committed a sin before God even though you may think that you have done a most wonderful work.
[102]  The Bible has many examples to illustrate this point.
[103]  Leviticus 10:1-2 says, "Now the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, each took his censer and put fire in it, and placed incense upon it, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them.
[104]  Brothers and sisters, God wants us to serve Him according to His instruction; He does not want us to serve according to what we think or presume.
[105]  Every work that originates from our thinking and presumption is rejected by God.
[106]  Little do we realize that when we were sinners, it was a sin for us to oppose God with our own wisdom, and now that we are saved, it is equally a sin to help God in His work with our own wisdom.
[107]  He wrote to the Corinthian saints, saying, "But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you.
[108]  For we are not extending ourselves beyond our bounds, as if we did not reach you...but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance" 2 Cor 10:13-15 .
[109]  He said he was not willing to extend himself beyond the bounds which God had measured for him.
[110]  CHAPTER FIFTY BURDEN AND PRAYER Scripture Reading: Jer 33:2-3; 1 Thes 5:19 ONE
[111]  However, burdens can only be received from God when our spirits are open to Him.
[112]  An open spirit to God is the condition for receiving burdens from God.
[113]  Because of our unfaithfulness we often do not receive any burdens; therefore, if we want to be those who bear God's burdens, we must be very sensitive and not reject any feeling that comes from Him.
[114]  While it is true that the burdens we have are from God and that our burden is God's will, it is also true that our knowledge mainly governs our burdens initially.
[115]  For instance, God may call certain things to our remembrance and may ask us to pray for them, or in the middle of the night God may call us to get up and pray for a brother in a remote place.
[116]  These experiences do occur, but they are not common, and God does not do this kind of thing very often.
[117]  Prayer is a matter of great importance in the spiritual life of a Christian.
[118]  However, even though some of the Lord's children spend time praying over many matters, they do not seem to get through in prayer.
[119]  When the children of Israel attacked the city of Ai, "they fled before the men of Ai.
[120]  "Then a voice came out of heaven: I have both glorified it and will glorify it again" v. 28 . If this is the way the Son of God, as the Son of Man, prayed to God on the earth, how dare we on the impulse of the moment open our lips and utter rash prayers! It is essential that we learn the key to prayer.
[121]  So He prayed a second time, "My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done" v. 42 . He prayed a third time, "saying the same word again" v. 44 . When He was utterly clear concerning the Father's will, He said to His disciples, "The hour has drawn near....Arise, let us be going" v. 45-46 . If our Lord as a man on the earth mastered the key to prayer and set Himself aside in order to seek after God's will, how dare we randomly utter a few words in prayer and conclude we have discerned God's will!
[122]  When the Canaanite woman was in distress, she cried out in her need, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!"
[123]  But it is amazing that the Lord "did not answer her a word" v. 23 . The disciples seemed to be in sympathy with her because they said on her behalf, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us" v. 23 . But what did the Lord reply to them? He said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" v. 24 . The Lord's reply gave the woman the key to approach Him.
[124]  His attacks are not sudden; they often come gradually.
[125]  Samson's failure was not as serious as the loss of his consecration.
[126]  He could not afford to lose his testimony of separation.
[127]  Once he lost his consecration, he lost his power; once he lost his testimony, he lost God's presence.
[128]  If you know that Satan is wearing you out, you have to pray for God to give you a feeling of disgust, that is, a feeling of disgust and anger with Satan!
[129]  Words are one of the most important things in our lives.
[130]  The Lord Jesus said, "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" Matt 12:34 .
[131]  If a man does not open his mouth, it is not easy for us to know his heart.
[132]  Many words are greatly twisted after they pass through a few mouths.
[133]  A word may pass from one man to another and then to a third and so on.
[134]  First Peter 3:9-12 says, "Not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing one another, because you were called to this, that you might inherit blessing.
[135]  For he who desires to love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips to speak no guile.
[136]  And let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it; for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears incline to their petition; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
[137]  We must pay attention not only to our speaking but also to our listening.
[138]  If the brothers and sisters know how to listen, they will eliminate much improper speaking.
[139]  If we, as God's children, want to know the kind of words we can or cannot say, we should first know the kind of words that we should and should not hear.
[140]  AND SUPPLY IN THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22-23; 4:16; 5:21; 6:10-18
[141]  In this chapter we would like to consider a few matters related to the Body of Christ.
[142]  We are only one member in the Body of Christ.
[143]  Since we are merely a member in this Body, we should accept the restriction of the Body.
[144]  Brothers and sisters, if you are a hand, you must be willing to remain a hand and also to come under the restriction of the other members.
[145]  Paul said, "But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you....We are not boasting beyond our measure in others' labors, but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance, so that we may announce the gospel unto those parts beyond you, not so that we may boast in another man's rule in things already prepared" 2 Cor 10:13, 15-16 .
[146]  The fellowship of the Body is not just a matter of receiving but also a matter of supplying.
[147]  If you think that all you have to do is receive and behave in an orderly and quiet way without causing any trouble, you do not know what is meant by the fellowship of the Body.
[148]  Brothers and sisters, you have to remember that fellowship has to do with the life of the Body.
[149]  CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE HOLDING THE HEAD Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22; 4:15-16; Col 2:19 ONE
[150]  In order for God to establish Christ as the Head over all things, He must first make Christ the Head of the church.
[151]  God must first make Christ the Head of the church before this headship can extend to include all things.
[152]  The future position of Christ in the universe has much to do with His position in the church today.
[153]  Brothers and sisters, God does not give us a piece of Christ; He has given us the whole Christ so that we may be tightly joined to Him.
[154]  Holding the Head means that we recognize only Christ as the Head; it means absolute obedience to the authority of Christ.
[155]  Ephesians 4:15-16 says, "We may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love."
[156]  CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX THE BREASTPLATE OF JUDGMENT Scripture Reading: Exo 28:6-7, 9, 12, 15-21, 29-30; 2 Cor 11:28-29; 7:3; Heb 13:17; 1 Pet 5:1-3, 5-6 ONE
[157]  In His selection of men on earth, God first picked out one man.
[158]  From this one man, a house was developed, and from the house, a nation was formed.
[159]  When there was one man, God appeared to him, spoke to him, and revealed Himself to him.
[160]  Brothers and sisters, although the breastplate is something in the Old Testament and there are differences in outward form between the Old Testament and the New Testament, God works according to the same principle in both testaments.
[161]  The things in the Old Testament are shadows, while the things in the New Testament are realities.
[162]  Therefore, God's way of revelation to His people is the same as His way of revelation to His children.
[163]  When one, two, three, or five of God's children are humble and fearful before the Lord and when they discover some problems among God's children or His Word is not clear among them, what should they do?
[164]  Brothers and sisters, do you feel that this subject does not interest you?
[165]  You have to realize that this is not just a matter of procedure.
[166]  There are some spiritual lessons to be learned here, and you can see the need of the breaking of the cross here.
[167]  If a church does not take the dealing of the cross daily, God has no way to speak to this church.
[168]  CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN LIVING BY THE LAW OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 8:1-2 THE FAILURE OF LIVING BY THE WILL
[169]  In the Christian life an important principle is to live not by one's own will but by the law of the Spirit of life.
[170]  Many Christians, especially the young ones, do not see this, nor have they learned this lesson.
[171]  Who will deliver me from the body of this death?", and one day he experienced deliverance.
[172]  Then he said, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death" Rom 8:2 .
[173]  This is not a new grace but a new revelation; it is not a new gift but a new vision; it is not receiving something new from God's hand but discovering something that God has already given.
[174]  On the practical side, we need to learn to know how the law of the Spirit of life operates within us.
[175]  The Lord uses the law of the Spirit of life to deliver us from the law of sin and of death.
[176]  He uses one law to overcome another law, and He uses today's law to overcome yesterday's law.
[177]  THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT Scripture Reading: Gen 35:1-8; 34:30 ONE
[178]  No matter how much spiritual advancement a man has achieved, he often needs the speaking from the environment.
[179]  In reading church history and in considering the experience of the Lord's followers, we do not know of one person who did not need the speaking of the environment at all.
[180]  Many examples point to the fact that the more spiritual a person is in the eyes of the Lord, the more he allows his environment to speak to him, and the deeper a person is in following the Lord, the more he allows his environment to remind him and speak to him.
[181]  Brothers and sisters, the precious thing about a man who has normal fellowship with God is that he will not be influenced by the environment, yet at the same time, he will allow the environment to speak to him.
[182]  If a man is not proper with the Lord and if he is not in fellowship with the Lord, a very small thing in the environment will affect him; however, at the same time, even a great thing in the environment will not cause his ear to be attuned to the Lord's voice or speaking.
[183]  If you can be affected by your environment yet not hear its speaking, it proves that you are no longer in fellowship with the Lord and that you have become fallen.
[184]  God said, "Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother" v. 1 . Brothers and sisters, God reminded Jacob of an old story.
[185]  God appeared to him in his dream, and when he awoke, he vowed, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee" 28:20-22 .
[186]  Brothers and sisters, when God shook up Jacob, what was found?
[187]  Such a spiritual person, one who knew God very much, had not only forgotten his vow, but also had hidden idols in his house!
[188]  If you ignore your first vow and allow these things to remain in your house while claiming to obey the inner leading and inner voice, God will raise up circumstances that will shake you so that the idols in your house will be shaken out.
[189]  We may be more experienced than before and we may boast that we know God more and that we are more mature, but when we turn back to our initial consecration, we will see we have fallen and that we have idols and golden earrings in spite of our maturity.
[190]  CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE PRAYING ACCORDING TO GOD'S DESIRE Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:14; Psa 119:147-148; Dan 9
[191]  In Daniel 9 we should pay attention to two things concerning Daniel's prayer.
[192]  First, a genuine man of prayer is not only one who comes before God continually but also one whose desires are fully blended into God's desires.
[193]  Brothers and sisters, if we come to God and remain calm before Him, giving up our thoughts to enter into His thoughts, we will see the great need for prayer, we will see that God is waiting for us to pray about so many things, and we will see that everything around can become the subject of our prayer.
[194]  Answer: Yes, God has given us a full provision in His Son through His Spirit.
[195]  If we did not have a full provision from the Lord, we might withdraw from our privilege and duty to pray.
[196]  Hebrews 10:19-22 says, "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh, and having a great Priest over the house of God, let us come forward to the Holy of Holies with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water."
[197]  Question: Why is Satan doing everything he can to frustrate our prayers?
[198]  Answer: Satan will do anything that he can to cut off our fellowship with heaven.
[199]  Question: What do we need to take care of in our prayer?
[200]  Answer: There are many things that we have to take care of in our prayer.
[201]  In the Bible water is a very important matter and has a great significance.
[202]  In Genesis 2, after creating man, God put him in the garden of Eden, which was watered by a river.
[203]  The last chapter of the Bible, Revelation 22, indicates that there is a pure river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the New Jerusalem v. 1 . In these passages, the Bible uses water as a symbol of the life of God.
[204]  Ezekiel 47 says that the water flowed out from under the threshold of the house.
[205]  After the first measuring, the water reached the depth of the ankles; when it was measured again, it was deeper; after the third measuring, it was deeper still; and after the fourth measuring, it became a river.
[206]  For instance, after you were saved, perhaps you knelt down by your bed to pray one morning; you came before God and touched Him.
[207]  After a man has received the Lord's grace, there should be some definite changes in his conduct and nature.
[208]  One of the changes should be in his temper.
[209]  Some people have believed in the Lord for many years, yet their temper is still the same as it was before they were saved.
[210]  Anger is a common thing, and there are many people who lose their temper easily.
[211]  But temper is the most superficial of all problems.
[212]  Strictly speaking, it should be dealt with the moment we believe in the Lord.
[213]  You will not lose your temper if you are a humble person in the eyes of God, if you consider others' jesting, despising, and slandering as the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and if you accept this disciplining work, saying, "Lord, this is all for my own good; these things have happened to me because You want to deal with my pride.
[214]  Third, as a consequence of self-exaltation, you think that others should not be as highly regarded as you.
[215]  You only want to see yourself being uplifted; you do not want to see others being uplifted.
[216]  You only want to gain something for yourself; you do not want others to gain anything.
[217]  CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE THE LAW IN THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Acts 8:4-8, 12, 14-17; 9:3-12, 15-17; 1 Tim 5:22; 4:14; 2 Tim 1:6; James 5:14-16; Matt 18:15-17, 20
[218]  In order to live the life of the Body of Christ, we must first have the revelation of the Body of Christ.
[219]  If we do not have the revelation of the Body of Christ, we will never cease our individual activities.
[220]  Some have said that there is nothing extraordinary about seeing the Body of Christ.
[221]  Yet, brothers and sisters, if you see the Body of Christ, you will know that there are laws in the Body of Christ and that you have to act according to these laws; these are not empty words.
[222]  Similarly, if a man says that he has seen the Body yet is independent and individualistic in his conduct, he is not holding the Head and has not received the revelation of the Body.
[223]  Paul said to Timothy, "For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands" 2 Tim 1:6 .
[224]  This means that the gift which Timothy had received at the time of the laying on of hands needed to be revived and rekindled.
[225]  First Timothy 4:14 says, "Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given to you by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."
[226]  Acts 9 shows us two characteristics of the revelation that Paul received at the time of his repentance.
[227]  He fell to the ground and heard a voice, saying, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" v. 4 . The Lord said, "Why are you persecuting Me?" He did not say, "Why are you persecuting those who believe in Me?" Paul asked, "Who are You, Lord?" The Lord answered, "I am Jesus, whom you persecute" v. 5 . The Lord showed Paul that all the believers are one with Him.
[228]  But how many of us know that we are not just believers but members as well?
[229]  We know that part of the Adamic life is sinful and natural, and we have to deal with both of these things.
[230]  Every member has a part in the service of the Body of Christ.
[231]  Everyone who belongs to the Lord has his portion and has Christ living within.
[232]  OF THE MEMBERS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:12-13, 15-16
[233]  One of the most important aspects of the walk of a person who lives for the Lord and who is free from the self is his function in the Body of Christ.
[234]  If you do not function as a member, this proves that you do not live for the Lord and that you are not yet free from your self.
[235]  If you are free from your self inwardly, your living will spontaneously manifest the particular function that you have as a member of the Body of Christ.
[236]  You may feel that you are living for the Lord and that you are free from your self, but your feeling is not reliable as long as you are not functioning as a member in the Body.
[237]  If we have not reached this stage yet and our function has not been realized in the church, this is a strong proof that we are not yet living for the Lord outwardly and are not free from our self inwardly.
[238]  The content is similar to the second "Preparation Message" given by Watchman Nee in the Third Overcomer Conference in January 1934 see Volume 11 of The Collected Works .
[239]  Since we have no assurance that this article is taken from the same spoken message, we have included it in this volume.
[240]  From the above three passages we can see the kind of Christian living that God delights in and the kind of living that is enduring and unchanging, one that survives blows and withstands tests.
[241]  The second reason that the word withers away is the lack of root.
[242]  Brothers and sisters, without light we will not realize how shallow we are.
[243]  Without the scorching of the sun, we will not understand why those who spring up fast also wither away fast.
[244]  How often we are deceived into complacency with our spiritual state!
[245]  Hosea 14:5-7 reads, "I will be like the dew to Israel;/He will bud like the lily/And will send forth his roots like the trees of Lebanon./His shoots will go forth;/And his splendor will be like that of the olive tree,/And his fragrance, like that of the trees of Lebanon./Those who sit under his shade will return;/They will revive like grain/And will bud like the vine;/His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon."
[246]  In this passage, Lebanon is spoken of three times: once in relation to the lily, once in relation to the olive tree, and once in relation to the vine.
[247]  CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN THE NORMAL MARRIAGE LIFE A word given at a wedding on October 2, 1936
[248]  Prayer: Our Lord Jesus, we thank and praise You because all good things come from You.
[249]  Lord, we are gathered together this afternoon for the wedding of our Brother Yang and Sister Wu.
[250]  We pray that You would bless this new couple and that they would see that everything is out of Your grace and Your love.
[251]  Concerning the family, Ephesians 5 first exhorts the wife.
[252]  I am not saying that everything related to the family first comes from the woman, but I can say that many things in the family come from the woman.
[253]  The husband's demands on the wife are not always that pleasant.
[254]  CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT A PERFECT FAMILY LIFE A talk given on October 6, 1936,
[255]  at the wedding of Brother Ping and Sister Bau ADJUSTING THE DIFFERENCES
[256]  Every time a brother and a sister are married, I have to say something.
[257]  The family is the place where one can easily become irritated.
[258]  I believe no place on earth irritates a person more easily than the family.
[259]  One common problem in the family is that some husbands complain that their wives have a quick temper, while the wives complain that their husbands have caused them to have a quick temper.
[260]  CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE EXPOSITION OF ROMANS 5:12 8:39 ROMANS 5:12-21
[261]  Romans 5:12-21 says that everyone in the world is a sinner.
[262]  Romans 8 tells us how we belong to Christ and how He performs everything within us.
[263]  Chapter six removes the sinner; it does not remove the sin.
[264]  The "now" in verse 1 means that there is no condemnation for those who know their flesh and who are in Christ.
[265]  Verse 2 says that we are no longer impotent this is the meaning of "no condemnation" in verse 1 .
[266]  When we are in Christ and in the Spirit, we have two deliverances: 1 We are delivered from the law in Christ, and 2 we are delivered from the flesh in the Spirit.
[267]  Verse 3 speaks of the law and the flesh and the Son of God becoming a sacrifice for sin.
