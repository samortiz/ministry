In the past we pointed out that the Lord&#8217;s coming will not take place suddenly; rather, it will come gradually. In a sense, the Lord will come back from heaven; but in another sense, He will come out of us. When He fully lives Himself out of us, that will be the time of His coming. According to Matthew 17:1-2 with 16:28, His coming was His transfiguration, and His transfiguration was His glorification. When He was transfigured, He was glorified.</p><p>Now we must see what it means to be glorified. When Christ, who is God, became a man, His divinity was incarnated in His humanity....Outwardly, He was a man, but inwardly He was the very God....The God hidden within the humanity of Jesus was the very glory. Thus, the glorious divine element was concealed within the human element of Jesus....In Christ&#8217;s transfiguration, His humanity was glorified; it was brought into God&#8217;s glory. Before that time, God was in Him, but His humanity was not in God&#8217;s glory. In His transfiguration His humanity was thoroughly saturated with His glorious divinity. In the coming manifestation of the kingdom, Christ will be like this. He will be the very Christ with both divinity and humanity, but His humanity will be soaked with His divinity.</p><p>The day is coming when we shall not only see this, but also experience it ourselves....Our humanity will be glorified by the glorious divinity within us....It is to be transfigured, not from without, but from within....Second Thessalonians 1:10 says, &#8220;When He comes to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed.&#8221; (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 585-587)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>3<sup>1</sup> Moses died and God hid his body (Deut. 34:5-6); Elijah was taken by God into heaven (2 Kings 2:11). God purposely did these two things that Moses and Elijah might appear with Christ on the mount of His transfiguration. They were preserved by God so that they could be the two witnesses in the great tribulation (Rev. 11:3-4). Moses represented the law, and Elijah, the prophets; and the law and the prophets were the constituents of the Old Testament as a full testimony of Christ (John 5:39). Now Moses and Elijah appeared and conversed with Christ concerning His death (Luke 9:31), which had been spoken of in the Old Testament (Luke 24:25-27, 44; 1 Cor. 15:3).</p><p>4<sup>1</sup> In his absurd proposal, Peter put Moses and Elijah on the same level as Christ; i.e., he made the law and the prophets equal with Christ. This was absolutely against God&#8217;s economy. In God&#8217;s economy the law and the prophets are only a testimony of Christ; they should not be put on the same level with Him.</p><p>5<sup>1</sup> This declaration of the Father, given to vindicate the Son, was first spoken after Christ&#8217;s rising from baptism, which signified His resurrection from the dead. This was the second time the Father made this declaration, this time to vindicate the Son in His transfiguration, which prefigures the coming kingdom.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 585-588; Hymns: #949</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
