   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX CHRIST THE BASIS OF OUR DOCTRINE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have said that Christianity does not emphasize doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, it emphasizes the person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even when some doctrines are mentioned, they are few in number, and when you go about expounding them, they always point back to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you turn to the four Gospels you will be amazed to find that everything recorded is just a description of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There must first be the knowledge of who He is; doctrines come afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have ascertained the person of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we want to take a look at the doctrines of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>COMPARISONS IN DOCTRINES</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You cannot find many doctrines in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Neither are there many doctrines in the Acts of the Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One finds doctrines only after coming to Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is exactly what we have said before, that you have to know who Jesus Christ is before you can understand what His doctrines are all about.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning doctrines, there is also a vast difference between those in Christianity and those in other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would like to mention again that the fact that I am a Christian does not mean that you have to feel and see things as I do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I will not take such a presumptuous attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I will only present the facts again, showing the difference between Christianity and other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I will not decide what is good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You are asked only to examine the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you think that this is right, then believe in it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Otherwise, take your choice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Emotional words are unnecessary here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I will, therefore, make no plea or invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Observing all the religions that are before us, you will see that all of them emphasize doctrines, not a person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whether Confucius or Lao-tze, who they are and what they teach are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are two separate entities.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their doctrines do not have much to do with their person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You can take the person away from the religion, and it will not make much difference.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The person only preached the doctrines, but he became disassociated from that which he preached.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not the case with our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When did Christian doctrines come into existence?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was after the death, resurrection, and departure from the world of the person Christ that the doctrines began.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All doctrines came later.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moreover, all these doctrines are centered upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The doctrines and Christ are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First you have Him, then you have His doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE UNION OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, there is a doctrine in Christianity that speaks of the union of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is a very important doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you open the Bible to see how this can be, you will see that the source of such a doctrine is the fact that God became a man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible does not present a doctrine of God becoming one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, it shows Jesus of Nazareth, who is a sample of God being one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Originally, God and man were separate; there was a wide gulf between them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was no possibility of union.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the Nazarene came.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was God coming to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was the bridge between man and God, joining the two into one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not a doctrine that teaches people to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here is the fact: henceforth, when a man is in Christ, he can be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE DOCTRINE OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Another very important doctrine in the Bible concerns death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible depicts man as being totally corrupted, without any possibility of being reformed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The only solution is death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A man is like a piece of worm-infested wood with no chance of being carved or shaped.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The only destiny for him is the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Death is the solution.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only dead people will not be proud if you praise them a thousand times.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only dead people will not be angry if you rebuke them repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only dead people will not be tempted by sin and will not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Death solves all problems concerning sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But how can we die?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How can such a death occur?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A religion will exhort you to die.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Be dead!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you are dead, sin will no longer have an object to work on!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But how can one die?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By committing suicide?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By throwing oneself into the sea?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Or as the old Chinese scholars have said, by considering everything that is past as dead yesterday?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All these are methods of common religions.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They are not the Christian teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>WE CAN DIE BECAUSE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The doctrine of death is absolutely related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>His person determines His doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Jesus died.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What does the Bible say about this?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It says that the world died with Him 2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>His death was to sin; hence, the whole world is dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Originally, the whole world was in sin, being dead in it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Only Jesus was not affected by death.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He did not die of sin; He died to sin Rom 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we are one with Him, we are also dead to sin by His death v. 11 . Sin will not have an object to work on.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All the problems of sin in us will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the doctrine of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is a fact that is absolutely tied to the person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is not an exhortation for people to conduct a moral life and repent from their wrongs.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>These are not Christian doctrines at all.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Since Christ has died, whoever is in Him is also dead, thoroughly dead, to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Sin has no more grip on us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If Christ had not died, there would not have been any doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>All experiences and doctrines are based upon this person Jesus Christ.</S>
