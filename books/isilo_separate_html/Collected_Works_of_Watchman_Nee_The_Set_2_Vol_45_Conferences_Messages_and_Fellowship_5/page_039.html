It is true that some have profound wisdom, quick mentality, power, eloquence, or great faith. But are these things Christ? There is a big difference between gifts and Christ.</p><p>I was once proud of my own wisdom. I thought that I was wiser than others. At that time I was living in darkness, the same as some of you are. Like Paul, I could say, "I advanced...beyond many contemporaries" (Gal. 1:14). Today I realize how foolish and shameful I was. At that time, however, I considered myself wonderful and sincere. I even believed that my advancement was real. When I first became a Christian, I spent a great deal of time in the Word. Once I read Andrew Murray's book, The Spirit of Christ, and I was so attracted by it that I did not want to eat or sleep. I just wanted to read on; I could not put it down. Later, I read Philippians 3:3, which says to "serve by the Spirit of God." I cannot quote the verse verbatim tonight, but the power of this word still remains with me today. Someone can understand the teaching of Philippians 3:3 and pass it on to others. But when I read it, I asked myself, "Am I reading this, or is it Christ who is reading this?" That night, for the first time, I experienced an aversion for "things." I was not grasping on to Christ, but to things. Up to that point it had been only a teaching, a kind of research; it was not Christ.</p><p>In spiritual matters it is very easy to have spiritual "things" without having Christ. This is the greatest work of Satan. When something becomes a thing or an object, it becomes dead. Today there are many works, testimonies, and studies that can only be considered as things, not Christ. It is not easy to replace Christ with ornaments and physical objects, but it is very easy to replace Him with experiences, gifts, and works.</p><p>A few weeks ago, someone asked me, "What is your opinion concerning miraculous things?" To tell you the truth, I have not seen many miraculous things. But when I have seen them, there has been very little of Christ in those things. Many people pride themselves in these things. They advertise these things and regard them as necessary for their power and recognition. Little do they realize that they are merely things. I am not against anyone having these things. But like Paul, I would say, "Moreover I show to you a most excellent way" (1 Cor. 12:31).</p><p>In 1926 I intended to work in a certain place. I felt that I should not go, but I went anyway. I could not say that I was rebelling against the Lord, but neither could I say that I was obeying Him. I did not find peace and could not pray. I could only utter some formal prayers and read the Word in a ritualistic way. The result of the work was good and many people were saved, but I was grieving. It was Sister Barber's wish that I not leave Foochow, but when someone wrote to her and told her of the result of the work, she commended me for the first time. However, I still did not feel at ease. I was working by the gifts that God had given me; I considered these gifts as things. They were merely things and not Christ. Today I can say that my gift is just Christ. This gift is a person. If I am related to the gifts without being related to Christ, the gifts will only be things. Although the Corinthian believers had gifts, their gifts were dead because Christ was not there.</p><p>Once light comes, everything is stripped away. Everyone treasures and boasts in the gifts. When a man has some gifts, he often thinks that he is better than others. When we have light, we will see that our gift and power are nothing but Christ. The very empowering strength is Christ. This is not just a slogan; it has to be a genuine seeing. Real gifts are not things; they are Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">Daily Walk&mdash;Prayer and the Study of the Word</h2><p>Prayer and the study of the Word are two common aspects of the daily walk of a Christian. But to many, these two things are just things. The day I read Andrew Murray's book, I asked myself, "Is your Bible reading Christ or is it merely a thing? Are your many prayers Christ or are they things?" If something has no life, it remains a thing. All that we struggle to do apart from Christ and all that we accomplish without contacting Christ are merely things. God may not want us to know a great deal of knowledge, or He may not want us to know it yet. But many of us have a lust for knowledge. We want to know the answers to all the problems in the Bible. If we cannot solve these problems, we cannot sleep or eat. Many of us engage in studies against our inner guidance. Others may not know if we are touching things or touching Christ, but we know.</p><p>When the disciples went to fish, they labored for the whole night without success. When the morning broke, Someone asked if they had anything to eat and told them to cast their net on the right side of the boat. At that very moment they knew that it was the Lord. Touching the Lord is very different from touching things. Things are rigid, dead, cold, and outward; they cannot touch a person.</p><p>The church can never be cheated. Although many young believers cannot articulate a point with their mouth, they know inwardly and can tell if something is Christ or just a thing. I am not saying that Bible reading is unnecessary. I am saying that all the spiritual things spoken of in the Bible are just Christ. Every thing that is apart from Christ is not Christ; it is merely a thing.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> </body></html>
