   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His Days Judah Being Saved,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Israel Dwelling Securely,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and His Name Being Called,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jehovah Our Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"In His days Judah will be saved, / And Israel will dwell securely; / And this is His name by which He will be called, / Jehovah our righteousness" Jer 23:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse reveals that the name of this Shoot is called "Jehovah our righteousness," indicating that Christ, as a descendant of David, is not merely a man but is the very Jehovah who created the heavens and the earth, selected Abraham, set up the race of Israel, and was the Lord of David, the One whom he called Lord Matt 22:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At Jeremiah's time there was no righteousness among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But Jeremiah prophesied that Christ would come as a Shoot who is Jehovah Himself to be the righteousness of God's chosen people 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, while God was condemning, punishing, and chastising His people, He intended to be incarnated as a Shoot unto David so that He could be His people's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Based on Christ's coming as Jehovah to be their righteousness, the evil race of Israel can be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to be His people's righteousness, Christ first had to die for them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He had to shed His blood to wash away their sins and accomplish redemption, for without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Based on the redemption accomplished through the death of Christ on the cross, God can justify His people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's people are justified by standing on the redemption of Christ and receiving Christ as God to be their righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have no righteousness in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"All our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment" Isa 64:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although in ourselves we do not have any righteousness, we have One who is God Himself as a man and who died on the cross to shed His blood to accomplish redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With this redemption as the basis, we can believe in Him to receive God's forgiveness, and God can justify us, make Christ our righteousness, and clothe us with the robe of righteousness Isa 61:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the Shoot of David to be Jehovah our righteousness, Christ is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>With Him we have divinity mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With Him we have the righteousness which is God Himself to be our righteousness, and we have redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With Him we have the life-giving Spirit and the riches of life, including the element of life, the law of life, and the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, the life we have in Christ as the Shoot of David and as Jehovah our righteousness is the processed and consummated Triune God to be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The revelation concerning such a Christ is surely a wonderful "fruit" found among the "dry leaves" and "dead branches" in the "orchard" of the book of Jeremiah!</S>
