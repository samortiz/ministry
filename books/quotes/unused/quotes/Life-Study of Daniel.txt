The subject of the book of Daniel is the destiny of Israel apportioned out by God, the contents of the seventy weeks
Our understanding of the history of the Jewish people and of the Gentile government would be inadequate without this book
Christ is the centrality and the universality of God's move, and this move is intrinsically involved with Israel and the Gentile government
It is the landmark where the old creation was terminated for the germination of the new creation in Christ's resurrection
The terminating death of Christ ushered in the resurrection, and in the resurrection the germination of God's new creation began
The entire image, which represents all human government, will be crushed, not from the head to the toes but from the toes upward to the head
Christ's coming to the throne of God to receive the kingdom from the God of the heavens takes place in Daniel 7
Before Daniel spoke in chapters ten through twelve about the destiny of Israel, he received a revelation of Christ in His excellency
Three were thrown into the furnace, but to his astonishment, Nebuchadnezzar saw another person within the furnace
The first part is seven weeks of forty-nine years, from the issuing of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the completion of the rebuilding
There is an insertion of Israel's history between the first sixty-nine weeks and the last week, in the age of the church
The history of Israel is physical, with nothing of a mysterious nature, but the church's history is altogether mysterious
Prior to Genesis 10 there were no human nations; instead, there was only mankind as a whole without established nations
All human government from Nimrod to Antichrist has been and will continue to be under the ruling of the heavens by the God of the heavens
In God's economy, Christ has terminated the old creation for the germination of the new creation in His resurrection through His death
All of these matters have been and will be intrinsically involved with Israel, either positively or negatively
The entire world situation is under the rule of the heavens by the God of the heavens, to match His economy for Christ
In Daniel 1:1 and 2, an introductory word, we see the issue of the degradation of God's elect the captivity to Babylon
According to chapters ten and eleven, Israel's destiny is related to the king of the south and the king of the north
The first six chapters of Daniel are concerned with the victory of the young descendants of Gods degraded elect over Satans further devices
The word gave here indicates that the king of Judah and the vessels were a present given to Nebuchadnezzar by God
For the children of Israel to be taken captive to Babylon means that they were captured back to the place of the worship of idols
Under the leadership of Moses, Abraham's descendants made their exodus from Egypt, and forty years later they entered the land of Canaan
In His sovereignty He had arranged for these young people to be taken to Babylon, where they were His overcomers
Because of their presence in Babylon, He was not defeated and could boast to Satan that even in Babylon He had His overcomers
That tree is something attached to Satan and even one with Satan, but the tree of life is something attached to God and one with God
To eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is to become attached to Satan; to eat of the tree of life is to become attached to God
If they had done this, God would have been finished and would have had nothing on earth for Himself and His interest
The name of Daniel which means God is the Judge or God is my Judge was changed to Belteshazzar the prince of Bel or the favorite of Bel
The name of Hananiah, which means 'Jehovah is kind,' or 'the favorite of Jehovah,' was changed to Shadrach 'enlightened by the sun god'
The name of Azariah, which means 'Jehovah is my help,' was changed to Abednego 'the faithful servant of the fire god Nego'
God honored Daniel's fighting, and Daniel and his companions became the overcomers among the remnant of God's defeated elect
With him and his companions we see the story of God's victory continuing on earth through the young overcomers
That dream should have impressed him deeply, but he forgot the dream because he did not have a heart for God's interest
The abdomen and thighs of bronze, corresponding to the third beast in 7:6, signify Greece, including Macedonia
The aggregate of human empires that began with Nimrod at Babel will consummate with the last Caesar of the Roman Empire with his ten kings
The Medo-Persian Empire adopted aspects of Babylonian culture, and the Macedonian-Grecian Empire adopted aspects of Medo-Persian culture
In the same principle, the Roman Empire adopted many elements of Greek culture and of the cultures that preceded it
Today we are still under the influence of Roman culture, especially in the matters of law, politics, and government
At His appearing as the stone cut out not by human hands, Christ will crush the great image from the toes to the head
Verses 34 and 35a say, 'A stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the image at its feet of iron and clay and crushed them
Daniel 2 reveals Christ as the smiting stone crushing the great human image and causing it to become like chaff carried away by the wind
By that time Christ will have already gained the church, and He will have married His bride, as described in Revelation 19
His coming will be a great surprise, for these rebellious ones will believe neither in Christ nor in God but only in themselves
Christ as the God-cut stone will come with His bride to strike the toes of the image, destroying it from the toes to the head
The great human image will be replaced with a great mountain, signifying the eternal kingdom of God, which will fill the whole earth
After Christ comes to crush the aggregate of human government, He will usher in the eternal kingdom of God on earth
The church today is Christ's increase in life, but the eternal kingdom of God is Christ's increase in administration
In life Christ increases to become the church; in administration Christ increases to become the eternal kingdom of God
Eventually, this increase will become the great mountain that fills the whole earth to be the eternal kingdom of God
Nebuchadnezzar made Daniel ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief of the prefects over all the wise men of Babylon
In the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream in chapter two, only the head of the great human image was called Babylon
It will eventually include the last Caesar of the Roman Empire, Antichrist, with his ten kings, signified by the toes of the great image
The book of Revelation tells us that under Antichrist, the last Caesar, the Roman Empire will be both political and religious Babylon
Revelation 18 refers to the empire of Antichrist as the political and physical Babylon, that is, 'Babylon the Great'
In verse 42 He asked them Have you never read in the Scriptures The stone which the builders rejected this has become the head of the corner
As far as human government is concerned, we need to consider what part of the great human image we are in today
The world situation, especially the situation in Europe, has been remodeled to fit in with the prophecies in the Bible
The culture, spirit, and essence of the Roman Empire continue to exist, but the form and appearance of this empire have vanished
The head of gold , signifying Nebuchadnezzar, corresponds to the first beast, which 'was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle'
The breast and arms of silver , signifying Medo-Persia, correspond to the second beast, which resembled a bear
Once he became strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven'
If we want a full picture of Antichrist, we need to study not only the book of Revelation but also these three types of Antichrist
With Nimrod, Antiochus Epiphanes, and Titus we have the picture, and in the book of Revelation we have the definition
In this message we will consider the victory of the young descendants of God's degraded elect over the seduction of idol worship
Nebuchadnezzar made a great image of gold, sixty cubits in height, and set it up in the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon
Daniels three companions the young overcomers among the Jewish captives stood against the devilish worship and were accused by the Chaldeans
If they had been spiritual, they would have said, 'Nebuchadnezzar, we are happy to go into the blazing furnace, because when we go He comes
The mighty men were slain by the flame of the fire, and the three young overcomers fell into the blazing furnace of fire bound up
Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and said to his counselors, 'Did we not throw three men into the midst of the fire bound up?
Christ had come to be with His three suffering, persecuted overcomers and to make the fire a pleasant place in which to walk about
We may think that if we have a troublesome husband or a bothersome wife, we should pray and ask God to deliver us out of such a situation
When the enemy throws us into the furnace, we should realize that we do not need to ask the Lord to deliver us
He will come to be with us and take care of us in our suffering, making our place of suffering a pleasant situation
There is still a group of overcomers to stand against the tide and to carry out God's worship, testimony, and interest on earth
In chapters one through six, this book does not present God's economy in theology or in teaching but in a series of cases
There are at least six cases recorded in Daniel 1 6 which show us what God's economy is and how God's economy can be carried out
He had not only the right position and the right angle to understand but also an intrinsic capacity in his being to understand
Although outwardly he was helped by Daniel to see that God is the Most High God, nothing within him was touched
Regarding Daniel as a hero, this great, overcoming general worshipped him and offered him an oblation with incense
God had received much worship in the temple in Jerusalem but that was destroyed and the utensils for worshipping God were brought to Babylon
Daniel's three companions answered Nebuchadnezzar boldly, saying, 'There is no need for us to give you an answer in this matter
If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the blazing furnace of fire, and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king
If He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor worship the golden image that you have set up'
In 4:1-3 we have Nebuchadnezzar's praise concerning God in His greatness, might, eternal kingdom, and everlasting dominion
Verse 5 says, 'I saw a dream and it frightened me, and the imaginings upon my bed and the visions of my head alarmed me'
In his dream Nebuchadnezzar saw a great, strong, tall tree, beautiful in foliage, rich in fruit, and good for food
As indicated by his praise at the end of chapter four, Nebuchadnezzar surely had learned the lesson to be abased and know God
They took the vessels that were for God's worship in His holy temple at Jerusalem and used them in worshipping idols
All the king's wise men came, but they could not read the writing nor make its interpretation known to the king
Before reading the writing and interpreting it, Daniel reminded Belshazzar of the experience of Nebuchadnezzar recorded in chapter four
Daniel regarded what happened to Nebuchadnezzar as a lesson not only for Nebuchadnezzar but also for all his descendants
Nebuchadnezzar had been severely disciplined by God and, after he had learned the lesson, offered praise to God
Soon after Daniel interpreted the writing, the Median army entered the city and the palace and killed Belshazzar
In chapter five concerning the case of Belshazzar, we see the importance of being serious with God and not disregarding any spiritual lesson
Belshazzar should have learned the lesson from Nebuchadnezzar's experience; however, he did not learn the lesson and suffered as a result
Among all the events in chapter five, or going along with all these events, God's economy was being carried out
If He had left the empire in the hand of the Babylonians, there could never have been a return of the captives to Israel
Daniel 6 is very crucial because it shows us how God carries out His economy with His elect for Christ's coming
It pleased him to set up over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps , who would be throughout the whole kingdom
Daniel was set by King Darius to be one of the three chief ministers over these one hundred and twenty satraps
Daniel distinguished himself among the chief ministers and satraps, and the king considered setting him over the whole kingdom
By this time, Daniel was no longer a young overcomer but had become an older overcomer; he may have been close to one hundred years of age
He had read the prophecy of Jeremiah which prophesied that the children of Israel would serve the king of Babylon for seventy years
Standing upon this word, Daniel must have prayed many times for the fulfillment of this prophecy and for the return of the captives
The chief ministers and the satraps assembled and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God
Knowing that the edict could not be changed, the king commanded, and the opposers threw Daniel into the lions' den
Just as the Lord did not quench the fire for Daniel's three companions, He also did not slay the lions for Daniel's sake
For He is the living God And enduring forever And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed And His dominion will be unto the end
He delivers and rescues And He does signs and wonders In heaven and on earth It is He who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions
Chapter six concludes by saying that Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian
During the time of Nimrod and Babel, God's interest was also frustrated, but He had a way to gain Abraham to be His worshipper
The time is coming when the descendants of this worshipper will become a priestly nation to worship Me and serve Me'
Today, as long as there are some overcomers on this earth, regardless of the number, God will have reason to boast
In chapters two and four, Nebuchadnezzar, a Gentile king, saw two great visions a great human image and a big tree
The big tree in chapter four corresponds to the head of the human image in chapter two: both signify Nebuchadnezzar
Daniel 7:1 says, 'In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed
God's economy in His creation was to make the Mediterranean area the center of culture up to the time of Columbus
In chapter two, in Nebuchadnezzar's dream human government on the earth was signified by a great human image full of glory and splendor
The beast's eagle wings signify that it was in the air, which belongs to Satan, the ruler of the air, and that its move was swift
The second beast corresponds to the breast and arms of silver of the great human image in 2:32, 39a, signifying Medo-Persia
As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but an extension of life was given to them for a season and for a time
In this message we will consider further the vision in Daniel 7 concerning the four beasts out of the Mediterranean Sea
We have seen that these four beasts are dreadful and terrible, doing whatever they desire as if there were no God in the universe
His throne was flames of fire; its wheels were burning fire; and a stream of fire issued forth and came out from before Him
A special court, with God's throne as the center, has been set up in the universe to judge the four human empires
Daniel 9:26, referring to the death of Christ on the cross for our redemption, speaks of Messiah's being cut off
In the sight of God, immediately after accomplishing redemption, Christ ascended to the heavens, coming to God to receive the kingdom
According to Daniel's vision, Christ accomplished redemption and then immediately came to God in ascension to receive the kingdom
His dominion is an eternal dominion, which will not pass away, and His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed
The cumulative culture of all the empires signified by the gold the silver the bronze the iron and the clay will be crushed by this stone
As the stone cut out without hands, Christ will become a great mountain and will fill the whole earth forever and ever
In Mark 4 He was sown as a little seed to be the kingdom of God but He grows in His increase to become a stone the increased kingdom of God
That clearing up of the old creation in its human government will usher in the universal and eternal kingdom of God
In Galatians 6:15 he goes on to say, 'Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation'
If we have such a clear view, we will know where we are today with respect to the parts of the great human image
In this message we will cover the vision of a ram and a male goat with its successors recorded in chapter eight of Daniel
The Medo-Persian Empire, the Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire were on the three continents of Asia, Africa, and Europe
The ram had two horns, and 'the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other; and the higher one came up last'
The goat came up to the ram in his mighty wrath, struck the ram, broke his two horns, threw him to the ground, and trampled him
In the sight of God, the Grecian Empire continued to exist in the four empires formed by Alexander the Great's four generals
Eventually, these four empires were merged and formed into two empires, one on the south and the other on the north
The days for him, Antiochus Epiphanes, to do evil things in the holy land would be two thousand three hundred days, from about 171 B
, which would be the day when the Jewish hero Maccabeus would cleanse the sanctuary after defeating Antiochus Epiphanes
Although the book of Daniel is short it has many points it speaks of many events and persons and it contains many spiritual lessons for us
Of course, the expression God's economy is not found in Daniel; neither is it found anywhere else in the Old Testament
Christ is the centrality and universality of Gods economy and Gods economy is for Christ to be the centrality and universality in Gods move
The various spiritual lessons and the historical details covered in this book are very good, but they are secondary
According to Daniel 235 and 44 Christ will come as the stone cut out without hands to crush the great human image from the toes to the head
Christ is God coming down to fight against rebellious mankind, and mankind is represented by one man who is one with Satan Antichrist
The most evil persons on earth will be gathered by Antichrist to one place; that is, the grapes will be gathered together into the winepress
The corporate Christ, Christ with His overcomers, will become a great mountain to fill the whole earth, making the whole earth God's kingdom
Daniel 7:13-14 reveals that now Christ as the Son of Man is before the throne of God to receive dominion and a kingdom
The book of Daniel also reveals that it is through their environment that Christ becomes the centrality and universality of God's elect
Through the nations as the environment, in the coming days God will eventually make Christ the centrality and universality of Israel
Those from one part of the world have one kind of beast, and those from another part have a different kind of beast
The book of Daniel covers three crucial matters: God's heavenly rule, the preeminence of Christ, and the portion of God's people
As those who have been chosen by God to be His people for Christ's preeminence, we are under God's heavenly rule
In 4:26 Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar, 'Your kingdom will be assured to you after you have come to know that the heavens do rule'
It is the heavens that rule, not Nebuchadnezzar or Cyrus or Alexander the Great or illness or turmoil or rebellion
Through our coordination and cooperation God will consummate His eternal intention to make Christ preeminent through the rule of the heavens
My burden is to point out that eventually human government will fight against God and will be crushed by Christ in His coming with His bride
Human government not only rebels against God, exalts man, and worships idols but also fights against God directly
Before the human government is crushed, there will be a long history, both of the world and of the new creation
If Christ did not have a bride, then He would have to fight alone against Antichrist, for Antichrist would have an army but Christ would not
On the day of His wedding, Christ will marry the one who has been fighting the battle against God's enemy for years
After His wedding, He will come with His newly-married bride to destroy Antichrist, who with his army will fight against God directly
Christ dealt with the problem of the old creation through His crucifixion, His all-inclusive death on the cross
Christ will deal with the problem of human government by coming with His bride to crush the great image from the toes to the head
In the Lord's recovery today, we are fighting against traditional, organized religion and are fighting for the new creation
Because traditional, organized religion does not help God's people to grow, there is the need for the Lord's recovery
The Lord's recovery is for the new creation, and the new creation requires transformation from the old into the new
Before His second appearing, He will continue to work in the church in a mysterious way to make us a new creation
We must admit that in the Lord's recovery we have not yet reached maturity; we are still too young to be presented to Christ as His bride
If Christ is our centrality and universality in this way, He will also be the centrality and universality in God's economy and in God's move
At that time the Babylonian Empire came to an end, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom at the age of sixty-two
Concerning Cyrus, on the contrary, Isaiah says that God delighted in him and even made him a shepherd to care for His people
He also arranged for the vessels of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar had brought to Babylon to be returned to Jerusalem
As the One in resurrection, He has germinated the new creation, and today He is working within us as His new creation
As such a wonderful One, He is preparing everything for His coming back to exercise His dominion over the whole earth
In Daniel 9:3-23 we see the way to obtain this vision Daniel's desperate seeking of the Lord God in prayer and supplications with fasting
In his prayer Daniel also supplicated for the holy city of Jerusalem, the holy mountain of God, and the holy people of God
Daniel asked the Lord to forgive them, not based upon their righteousness but based upon God's great compassion
In his desperate prayer, Daniel requested that God recover the holy land, send His people back, and rebuild the holy city
The coming kingdom age will be an age of divine righteousness, and in the new heaven and new earth, there will be eternal righteousness
In His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to germinate those whom God has chosen and make them a new creation
Between the sixty-ninth week and the last week, there is a gap which has already lasted for nearly two thousand years
In this gap the church is being secretly and mysteriously built by Christ in His resurrection to be the Body of Christ and bride of Christ
In the middle of the seventieth week, Antichrist will change his mind, fight against God, and cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease
During the great tribulation, both the faithful Jews and the Christians still on earth will suffer Antichrist's persecution
After he causes the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, Antichrist will replace them with the abominations of the desolator
Eventually, the complete destruction that has been determined will be poured out upon the desolator, Antichrist
After the visions seen by Daniel in chapters seven through nine, Daniel saw the vision concerning the destiny of Israel
After this vision of Christ, an angelic messenger came to tell Daniel about the things behind the physical world
He told Daniel that he himself was fighting against the prince of the kingdom of Persia, a rebellious evil spirit
In chapter five we saw how Belshazzar was indulging in debauchery and how in the same night Darius the Mede came to defeat him and kill him
Darius was strong even as an old man because this heavenly messenger stood up to support him and strengthen him
The angelic messenger strengthened Darius to defeat the Babylonians because the Babylonian Empire's commission from God had been completed
With the death of Belshazzar, the Babylonian Empire became the empire of Medo-Persia to carry out another commission for God
The second horn was higher than the first, referring to Cyrus the Persian who assumed power two years later in 536 B
Because Cyrus supported them, supplied them, and protected them, Isaiah said that Cyrus was a shepherd of God to take care of God's people
Apparently, all of these struggles are merely the activities of human governments represented by the great human image in Daniel 2
That distress came upon Israel from a war between the king of the south and the king of the north, referring to Egypt and Syria respectively
Daniel 10:2 11:1 shows us the scene in the universe the spiritual world behind the physical before the release of this vision
In our eyes the incarnation took place at a definite point in time, whereas in God's view there is only the fact but no time element
He appeared to Daniel not wearing armor for fighting but dressed in a linen robe, the Old Testament priestly garment
At the time of Daniel 10, Christ Himself, God's centrality and universality, was a Priest taking care of the children of Israel in captivity
For His people's appreciation Christ appeared also in His preciousness and dignity as signified by His body being like beryl
Because the vision of Christ was spiritual, not physical, it was seen only by Daniel and not by those who relied on their physical sight
Following the vision concerning Christ as the precious One in God's move, we see something regarding the spiritual struggle in the air
Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help the sent angelic messenger, and the sent messenger remained there with the kings of Persia
The crucial point we need to see is that behind the scene a spiritual struggle, a struggle not seen with physical eyes, was taking place
No one would hold with the angelic messenger against these two evil princes except Michael, the prince of Israel
We may say that the first five chapters of Daniel give us a full definition and description of the Babylonian Empire
From this we see that the book of Daniel covers the entire human government from the Babylonian Empire to the Roman Empire
The next verse refers not to Titus but to Antichrist, the one who makes 'a firm covenant with the many for one week'
Marked the end of the Babylonian Empire and the beginning of the Medo-Persian Empire, which lasted until 336 B
Daniel 11:5-20 speaks of the wars back and forth between the king of the south Egypt and the king of the north Syria
Daniel 11:21-45 and 8:23-25 describe the kingdom and the evils of Antiochus Epiphanes as one of the kings of the north
The armies of Antiochus Epiphanes profaned the sanctuary, removed the daily sacrifice, and set up the abomination that desolates
Antiochus Epiphanes even went so far as to erect an altar to Zeus on the altar of burnt offering in the temple
He forced the holy people to worship the idol and eat pork, and he seduced young men to commit fornication in the temple
According to verse 34, the Maccabees would receive a little help, and many joined themselves to them in word only
In all the abovementioned evils, Antiochus Epiphanes was a type of Antichrist, who will come in the last week of the seventy weeks
Whereas verses 21 through 35 of Daniel 11 refer to Antiochus Epiphanes, verses 36 through 45 refer to Antichrist
He will exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and against the God of gods he will speak extraordinary things
He will not regard the gods of his fathers or the desire of women, nor will he regard any other god, for he will magnify himself above all
He will honor instead a god of fortresses, and he will take action against the most fortified of fortresses with the help of a foreign god
At the time of the end, the king of the south will push against him, and the king of the north will storm back at him
News from the east and from the north will trouble him, and he will go forth with great wrath destroying and exterminating many
For his enjoyment Antichrist will pitch the tents of his palace between the Mediterranean Sea and the beautiful holy mountain
After seventy years, Cyrus the king of Persia released the captives of Israel to return to their fathers' land to rebuild the temple
That cleansing was a justification, declaring that the temple was the holy place for God's people to worship Him
According to the Bible, there will be a fourth destruction of the temple by Antichrist in the middle of the last seven years of this age
All these cases show us that the center, the aim, and the goal of Satan's struggle against God is related to the temple
God desires to have a place on earth for His people to worship Him, as a testimony that He still has an interest on this earth
The book of Daniel covers a wide span of the Bible, from Genesis 10 to the end of the New Testament, from Babel to the New Jerusalem
We have emphasized the fact that the great human image in Daniel 2 is the basic principle and controlling factor of Daniel's prophecy
The vision concerning the destiny of Israel in chapter twelve is related to the archangel Michael's standing for Israel
During this time of distress and tribulation, the shattering of the power of the holy people will be completed
With the coming of the kingdom, there will be the cleansing and recovering of the defiled and trampled temple for thirty days
Verse 13 says, 'But you, go your way until the end, and you will rest and rise again in your lot at the end of the days'
Those who have perished will be resurrected after the kingdom age and suffer eternal reproach and contempt in eternity forever and ever
When Christ comes back to set up the kingdom, the small number of remaining Jews, the remnant of Israel, will also be saved and regenerated
The old creation includes four ages: the age of the patriarchs, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom
At the end of the thousand years of the age of the kingdom, there will be one more rebellion, requiring a further purification
The New Jerusalem includes the twelve names of the apostles and the twelve names of the twelve tribes of Israel
The nations who remain after the final sifting and purification will be transferred to the land in the new earth to be the citizens forever
The book of Daniel shows us a man whose heart is one with God and is set absolutely on the destiny of his people, Israel
In His divine economy God will perfect Israel to be His priests, and He will prepare His created and restored nations to be His people
