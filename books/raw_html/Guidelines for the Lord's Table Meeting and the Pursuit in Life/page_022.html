 <h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO HAVE A RESERVE IN OUR LIVING</h2>
<p>I hope that we would all apply ourselves in these matters. If we have a personal reserve, we will be able to draw from it and use it in the meetings. Many times, we cannot open our mouths and pray, because on the one hand, we do not have the inspiration, and on the other hand, we do not have enough reserve. It is not that we lack a burden in our spirit to pray; rather, it is that we do not have the utterance for prayer or a reserve for prayer. For example, it may not be as easy for the Chinese to speak in English as it is for them to speak in Chinese. When they converse in English, they may not have enough vocabulary to express the many feelings within them; thus, there are many things that they cannot express.</p>
<p>In our daily living we must practice to gain the utterance for prayer; we also need a reserve of prayer. We do not merely need to exercise our praying spirit; much more, we must seize each opportunity to exercise out of our reserve of prayer. In this way we will gain the key to prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER OF CONTINUITY</h2>
<p>Some have asked what utterance and vocabulary are needed to pray in continuity. In the atmosphere of a meeting we may sense that we are before the Lord and that the Lord is among us; we also may sense that He is leading us and that we are following Him to the Father. At this time someone needs to create a feeling of praise to the Father and motivate and draw out the worship of the Father. After a motivating prayer, another brother should offer a prayer for strengthening. Then we need a prayer to express, not to initiate. To initiate something is to bring in something that was not present. However, when the spirit of the meeting is strong, and we all have the sense that the Lord of glory is among us and leading us to worship the Father, there is no need for an initiating prayer. There is only a need for an expressive prayer to continue the previous section.</p>
<p>Some of the prayers in the table meeting are initiating prayers; they speak forth a feeling that was not previously present in the meeting. Other prayers are expressive prayers to speak forth and express the feeling that is presently in the meeting. Still other prayers are motivating prayers to cause the meeting to turn from one atmosphere to another. Finally there are strengthening prayers. Regarding the words we use in our prayers, we should not speak doctrine; we should express the reality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A DIRECTION IN OUR PRAYER</h2>
<p>With the literature work in Shanghai we had a principle in writing our articles: we always considered that we were speaking a message instead of being shut up in a room alone. We would not have been able to write our articles if we considered ourselves as being shut up in a room. Even though we were writing in a room, we always considered ourselves to be speaking to an audience. Only in this way could our writing be living and real. Even though no one was with us, we considered that the brothers and sisters were before our eyes and that we were speaking to them.</p>
<p>Our prayer should be in this principle; we should direct our prayer. We know that the Lord Jesus is within us and among us; we are not simply praying to the air with our eyes closed. In this way we can be delivered from doctrinal prayers. I believe that our prayers will be greatly improved if we can firmly grasp these crucial points.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DILIGENT IN OUR EXERCISE<br />
AND NOT DESPISING IT</h2>
<p>If we are willing to apply ourselves in these matters in the church life, we will be able to touch some definite, spiritual matters in the meetings. Our meetings are not rich or enjoyable because we do not know how to meet. For this reason we must carefully exercise how to meet; we should never consider this as a small matter. All who serve the Lord and all the responsible brothers in the churches must be diligent in this kind of exercise; we must not despise this matter.</p>
