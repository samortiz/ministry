   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Father Giving All to the Son</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Gospel of John, the word all is used several times.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In theology, there are four terms: all men, all matters, all things, and all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All comprises all matters and all things, and all things includes all men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Take Acts 10:34-36 as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the house of Cornelius, Peter said that the Lord Jesus is the Lord of "all."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although The Mandarin Union Version also translates this word as "all," here all refers to all men cf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 Tim 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Peter thought that the Lord was just the Lord of the Jews but not of the Gentiles; however, now when he came to the house of a Gentile, he clearly saw that the Lord was the Lord of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, we can see that in this verse all refers to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Gospel of John, the first time the word all is mentioned is in 1:3. there the Greek word for all things is actually the word for all, which includes all men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second time is in 3:31, which says, "He who comes from above is above all."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 35 continues, "The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 3:35 is a very precious verse.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It says that the Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here all equals all that the Father has in 16:15.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, these two verses are joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 3:35 says, "The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand," and in 16:15 the Lord said, "All that the Father has is Mine."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All that the Father has is the Son's because the Father loves the Son and has given all to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, 13:3 says, "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse has the same meaning as 3:35, saying that the Father has given all to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, in 16:15 the Son could say, "All that the Father has is Mine."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said this word based on 3:35 and 13:3, which say that the Father has given all to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word given in 3:35 and 13:3 actually means "transmitted," indicating that the Father's riches have all been transmitted to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the riches of the Father have been given, transmitted, by the Father to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, we must see that when the Father transmits all to the Son, the Father also comes with what He transmits. the Father is always in the transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the first step of the transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the Fullness of the Godhead Dwelling in Christ Bodily</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul told us in his Epistles that Christ the Son is the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Fullness here is the expression of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The full expression of all the riches of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before His incarnation Christ as the Word of God did not have a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His incarnation He became a man with a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a man Christ's physical body is His very person, and in Him all the fullness of the Godhead is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is because the Godhead includes the Father, and since the Father has given all to the Son, the Son is the treasury of all the riches of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, now that the Son has become flesh, all the riches of the Father spontaneously dwell in the Son bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This "dwelling" is the second step of the transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All That the Son Has Being in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The third step is that all that the Son has and all that He has obtained have all been transmitted to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 16:15 says, "He receives of Mine."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit has received everything from the Son; all that the Father has was transmitted to the Son, and now all that the Son has, has been transmitted to and received by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the third step of the transmission.</S>
