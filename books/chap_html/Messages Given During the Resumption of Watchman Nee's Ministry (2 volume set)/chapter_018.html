<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br>AND MAN-MADE WORKS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (2)</H1><p>Date:Morning, January 10, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</H1><P>Prayer: May the Lord deliver us from quick minds and curious thoughts. We admit that it is very difficult for the Lord's word to come into our heart. May the Lord cause the words that we hear to lead us to the presence of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAN-MADE WORKS BEING<br>COUNTERFEITS AND BEING ARTIFICIAL</H2><P>In Christianity, preachers always try to impress others with the importance and goodness of a truth. At the end, they would point out how one can obtain such truth, what one should do first, and what he should do next. The listeners may be impressed and may try to practice accordingly when they go home. But in the end, they always find out that the teachings do not work. In the Bible, the apostles did not do this kind of work. Spiritual things do not come through our strivings, strugglings, or resolutions. They are a direct result of God's light. Saul on the way to Damascus did not hear any special message, but he saw the revelation of Christ. In preaching the Lord's word, we have to look to the work of the Holy Spirit, and our being has to go out with the release of the Lord's word. This is the way to put the word into others' being. Some preaching gives others the revelation, whereas other preaching only presents the methods in a clear way. In the latter case, the listeners may be touched, but when they try to practice the methods, their endeavors are but man-made works. Man-made works are counterfeit works. When the Japanese occupied China, there was the so-called puppet government. The puppet government is a counterfeit government. Many so-called spiritual virtues are actually like artificial flowers. They are like the fruit on the Christmas trees, which do not grow out of the trees, but are put there by hand. Artificial goodness is man-made goodness. This kind of goodness is a result of the work of the preachers. A man can have any kind of outward performance; he can act like a seminary student, walking slowly with the Bible in his hands and with his eyes fixed to heaven. But this kind of acting accomplishes nothing. He can come to the meeting with bowed head and silent prayers, and he can nod his head continually while listening to the message. He can pray silently after the message to show that he is touched by the words. But after the meeting, on his way home his eyes will catch some attractive things, and his true self will be exposed again. No wonder there are so many hypocrites today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CONFUCIUS' TEACHING<br>AND GOD'S TEACHING</H2><P>It is good that the evangelists are helping people to be saved. Many of the truths passed on to such ones after their salvation are counterfeit teachings. What many so-called great pastors and evangelists are preaching is but Confucian teachings, or godly teachings. Man likes to hear these godly teachings. But ninety-nine percent of these teachings are on counterfeit goodness. Exhortations to be godly and to be just are things that a person uses to teach others; they are not things that a person lives out in his life. We have to forget about all these things. On the one hand, we should not be lawless. On the other hand, we should not bind ourselves; everything should be done in a spontaneous way. We would rather not do something than to do it in pretension. To do something in pretension damages a person more than not doing anything. If someone is somewhat loose, we should not feel sad. If someone is somewhat meek, we should not feel happy. Humanly speaking, to be meek is surely better than to be rough. But before God, there is not much difference between meekness and roughness. Spiritual matters are not accomplished through outward strivings. Paul received the light on the way to Damascus, not through his own pursuits or strivings, but through God's taking hold of him. You may say that if this is the case, we might as well give up. But while you may give up, God will not give up; He will take hold of you. The thing I fear the most is for a person to live by himself merely according to ethics. This kind of conduct is the work of producing artificial flowers. Of course, we have to admit that, humanly speaking, Confucius' teachings are good. The Chinese say that humility brings profit whereas arrogance brings loss. For thousands of years, we have upheld the Confucian teachings. Humanly speaking, they are good teachings. But the New Testament is not on human ethics, but on divine ethics. The New Testament says that we have to hate our parents, brothers and sisters, and children. It is not teaching us to be humanistic, but to live God and to follow Him. The teachings in Christianity tell people what to do, and the teachings in other religions also tell people what to do. But none of these teachings are of any value.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOLD, SILVER, AND PRECIOUS STONES<br>VERSUS WOOD, GRASS, AND STUBBLE</H2><P>First Corinthians 3 says that with some people, their works will be burned up by fire. It does not mean that they have sinned or have lost their temper, and so forth. It means that the nature of their works will be tested, and their works will be found not to be built on the foundation of Christ. All works that originate from the self are wood, grass, and stubble; and everything that comes from God is gold, silver, and precious stones. Gold is versus wood. Gold signifies God's nature, whereas wood signifies the human nature. Silver signifies redemption, whereas grass signifies the flesh. Stubble is earthly, and it is versus the precious stones. The precious stones speak not only of God's image, but of the heavenly glory as well. What God wants to gain in us today is gold, silver, and precious stones, and not wood, grass, and stubble.</P>
