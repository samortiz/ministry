to Those Who Fear Him and Serve Him</h2>
<p>In verses 13 through 18 we see Jehovah&rsquo;s encouragement to those who fear Him and serve Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Words of Some of the Sons of Jacob<br />
Being Strongly against Jehovah</h2>
<p>The words of some of the sons of Jacob were strongly against Jehovah (v. 13a).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Saying That It Was Vain to Serve God</h2>
<p>They said, &ldquo;It is vain to serve God,&rdquo; and they asked, &ldquo;What profit is it that we have kept His charge and have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?&rdquo; (v. 14). They worshipped and served God, but they did it mournfully, not at all happy that they were required to do these things.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Calling the Arrogant Blessed</h2>
<p>Those who spoke strongly against Jehovah also said, &ldquo;Now we call the arrogant blessed; not only have those who act wickedly been built up, but they also try God and escape&rdquo; (v. 15). This indicates that these opposers of God seemed to be saying, &ldquo;The way to be blessed is not to be humble but to be arrogant. The ones who act wickedly not only are built up, but they try God, not believing Him and not giving Him the tithe, and they escape from any kind of calamity. Instead of suffering, they escape tribulation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Word of Encouragement by Jehovah</h2>
<p>Verses 16 through 18 are the word of encouragement by Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Those Who Feared Jehovah Speaking to One Another</h2>
<p>Those who feared Jehovah spoke to one another, each to his neighbor, and Jehovah gave heed and listened (v. 16a).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. A Book of Remembrance Being Written before Jehovah</h2>
<p>Verse 16b tells us that a book of remembrance was written before Jehovah of those who feared Him and considered His name. We today consider, love, regard, respect, and sanctify God&rsquo;s name, and He keeps a record of this. We may not remember our fellowship concerning Christ and the church, but God keeps a record of this fellowship in His book of remembrance.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Sons of Jacob<br />
Being Jehovah&rsquo;s Personal Treasure</h2>
<p>According to verse 17, the sons of Jacob will be Jehovah&rsquo;s. They will be a personal treasure in the day that He prepares (the day of His anger), and He will spare them, as a man spares his son who serves him.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The Sons of Jacob Returning<br />
and Discerning between Him Who Is Righteous<br />
and Him Who Is Wicked</h2>
<p>Finally, in His word of encouragement to those who fear Him and serve Him, Jehovah said that they will return and discern between him who is righteous and him who is wicked, between him who serves God and him who does not serve Him (v. 18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Jehovah&rsquo;s Warning by the Day of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Malachi 4:1-6 is Jehovah&rsquo;s warning by the day of Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Day Coming, Burning like a Furnace</h2>
<p>The day of Jehovah comes, burning like a furnace, and all the proud ones and all the ones who act wickedly will be stubble. The coming day will set them ablaze, so that it will not leave them root or branch (v. 1).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Unto Those Who Fear<br />
Jehovah&rsquo;s Name the Sun of Righteousness<br />
Arising with Healing in His Wings</h2>
<p>Unto those who fear Jehovah&rsquo;s name the Sun of righteousness&mdash;the healing Christ&mdash;will arise with healing in His wings. They will go forth and leap about like well-fed calves. They will trample the wicked; for the wicked will be ashes under the soles of their feet in the day that Jehovah prepares (vv. 2-3).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Charging the Sons of Jacob to Remember<br />
the Law of Moses, the Statutes and the Judgments</h2>
<p>In verse 4 the sons of Jacob were charged to remember the law of Moses, that is, the statutes and judgments. The law is the Ten Commandments; the statutes are detailed items of the law; and the judgments are ordinances. When a judgment is added to a statute, that statute becomes an ordinance. For example, the commandment to keep the Sabbath and not to profane it, lacking any mention of judgment, is simply a statute. But when a judgment is added, perhaps the sentence of death by stoning, the statute becomes an ordinance.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Promising to Send Elijah the Prophet to Them<br />
before the Great and Terrible Day<br />
of Jehovah Comes</h2>
<p>Finally, in verses 5 and 6, God promised to send Elijah the prophet to them before the great and terrible day of Jehovah comes (Matt. 17:10-11; Rev. 11:3-4). Elijah will turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers, lest Jehovah comes and strikes the land with a curse. This is the closing word of Malachi and the last word of the Old Testament.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_075.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_077.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of the Minor Prophets &nbsp; pg 76</div><br></body></html>
