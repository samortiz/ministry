   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Unique Way in God s Economy and</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Center of God s Government Scripture Reading: Col 1:20-22; 2:11-15; 3:5a In His economy God gives us one person and one way; the one person is the all-inclusive, extensive, preeminent Christ, and the one way is the cross 1 Cor 2:2; Phil 2:5-11; Gal 6:14: We not only have Christ, the unique person, who is versus all things; we also have the cross, the unique way, which is versus all ways Col 1:20.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to have the proper church life, we need to experience the cross; if we have a daily life of passing through the cross, there will be oneness and harmony both in the church life and in the family life Col 3:12-15.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have a clear understanding of the fact that the enemy of God, in a subtle way, utilizes culture to replace Christ, we will realize that the only way for us to take is the way of the cross Gal 6:14; 1 Cor 2:2: The book of Colossians teaches us that in the church life Christ must be all and in all; everything that is not Christ must go to the cross 1:18; 3:10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the cross we need to become nothing, to have nothing, and to be able to do nothing; otherwise, what we are, what we have, and what we can do will become a substitute for Christ 1 Cor 1:17-18, 23.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because of the rebellion of Satan, the archangel, and the angels who followed him, the heavens were contaminated; therefore, not only things on the earth but also things in the heavens needed to be reconciled to God v. 20b.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because we were sinners, we needed redemption, and because we were also enemies of God, we needed reconciliation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>14, 21-22.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross 2:14: Ordinances refers to the ordinances of the ceremonial law with its rituals, which are the forms or ways of living and worship Eph 2:15.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it Col 2:15: This verse portrays the fighting that took place at the time of Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Activities involving Christ, God, and the evil angelic rulers and authorities were brought to a focus on the cross; thus, the cross became God s eternal, central, and unique way vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>14-15.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By His crucifixion Christ labored to accomplish redemption, and God the Father was working to judge sin and nail the law to the cross v. 14.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the same time, the evil rulers and authorities were busy in their attempt to frustrate the work of God and Christ, pressing in close to God and Christ; thus, a warfare was raging at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God openly made a display of the evil angelic rulers and authorities on the cross and triumphed over them in it, putting them to shame v. 15.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ v. 11: This is spiritual circumcision, the circumcision of Christ, referring to the proper baptism, which puts off the body of the flesh by the effectual virtue of the death of Christ Phil 3:3.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The circumcision that is the putting off of the body of the flesh was not made with hands; it was accomplished by the death of Christ, and it is applied, executed, and carried out by the powerful Spirit Rom 8:13.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth Col 3:5a: This is based on the fact that we have been crucified with Christ and baptized into His death Gal 2:20; Rom 6:3, 6.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ accomplished the all-inclusive crucifixion; now we apply it to our lustful flesh.</S>
