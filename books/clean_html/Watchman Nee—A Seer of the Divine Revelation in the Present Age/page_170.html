<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LAST CONTACT</H2><P>Early in 1950 Watchman Nee visited Hong Kong from the China mainland. Because a revival was brought there through his ministry, he cabled me in Taiwan, asking me to meet him there before he returned to China. I replied that I was in the midst of an important conference in Taipei and would not be able to arrive in Hong Kong before he left. His response was that as soon as I was free I should go to Hong Kong, regardless of whether he was still there or not, to arrange the service of the church there. Eventually, on February 16, I went to Hong Kong and stayed there for one and a half months.</P><P>The following is a testimony of Brother Hsu Jin-chin, an elder in the church in Hong Kong during that period of time:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>On the evening of February 15, 1950, Brother Nee told us, "This afternoon I received a cable from Brother Lee. He will be here tomorrow to fellowship with the elders and the responsible brothers. I have also asked him to take the lead here. Tomorrow he will arrive. At that time I hope that you will receive him at the airport." By then, I was an elder already, and I arranged to have the brothers and sisters receive him at the Kai-Tak airport the next day.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>On the morning of the day after I arrived, Brother Nee took me to the meeting of co-workers and leading ones. In the presence of all, he said, "Brother Witness, according to the authority the Lord has given you, please make arrangements for all the service of the co-workers, the elders, and the deacons in the church here." This was an assignment of tremendous responsibility, to lay a good foundation for the church service in Hong Kong.</P><P>In the evening he took me to the special meeting of the revival and asked me to speak. I said, "As long as you are present, I have no burden to speak." He then continued to minister in those special meetings.</P><P>In the revival in Hong Kong, some brothers and sisters handed over their possessions to the work for the Lord's recovery. Watchman asked me to share the responsibility with him in the arrangement for their disposal.</P>
