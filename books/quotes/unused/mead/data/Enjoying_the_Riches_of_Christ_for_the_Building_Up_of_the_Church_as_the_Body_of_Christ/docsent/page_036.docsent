   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REMEMBERING THE LORD BY EATING AND DRINKING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following chapter ten is the Lord's supper in chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although I was in Christianity for many years, and I attended the so-called communion many times, I never heard anyone say that to remember the Lord is to eat Him and to drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus told us to eat and drink in remembrance of Him 11:24-25; Matt 26:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The proper remembrance of the Lord is to eat and drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To have the remembrance of a certain loved one is to exercise our mind to recall the goodness and virtues that person had.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But to remember the Lord Jesus is not that way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To remember the Lord Jesus is to eat Him, to take Him in. "Take, eat; this is My body" Matt 26:26 ; "this do unto the remembrance of Me" 1 Cor 11:24 . "Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood" Matt 26:27-28 ; "this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me" 1 Cor 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's table is an exhibition of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Day by day we live by eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Day by day we eat Jesus and we live by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then on the first day of the week we come together to make a declaration to the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may say, "Satan, angels, demons, all come and see.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our way of living day by day is to eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we come to the Lord's table for an exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is our life, and this is our daily walk."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if we do not have such a life and daily walk, the Lord's table meeting is merely a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this case, the church becomes a theater for actors and actresses to perform something.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not an exhibition, a declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, it is a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's table meeting should not be a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It must be an exhibition, a declaration, made by us to all the beings in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that whenever we have the Lord's table, we would make such a declaration: "Oh, all beings, come and see!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Satan, come and see!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the angels, all the demons, and all creatures, come and see!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our way to live is to eat and drink Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we exhibit this living to the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the remembrance of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>TRANSFORMED BY EATING JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First Corinthians 12:13 says we "were all given to drink one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way to drink is in verse 3: "Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever we say, "Lord Jesus," we are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we say, "O Lord Jesus," we are drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to take in the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 3:6 Paul said, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By drinking we get the watering, and the watering is for growing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Following growth is the transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we have seen, the church is a farm for growing plants, but eventually all the plants are transformed into precious materials gold, silver, and precious stones v. 12 . This is not an outward change, but a change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Greek word for transformation is anglicized as metamorphosis.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Metamorphosis is a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a change by outward improvement but a kind of chemical change.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A new element is added into us, nourishing us, discharging all the old things and replacing them with something new.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Metamorphosis is a change in life with a new element replacing the old.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the very meaning of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The way to have this change is by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If our face is pale, we may use cosmetics to change its color.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is an outward change, not a transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, if day by day we take steak, chicken, milk, eggs, and fruit, after two months our face will be shining.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not a mere outward change but a transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Day by day we eat Jesus as the heavenly steak and chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By this eating we have growth, and with the growth there is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By transformation we are no more the wood, grass, and stubble; we become gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>TRANSFORMATION FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the New Jerusalem there is nothing muddy or wooden.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everything there is gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul was a marvelous writer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He said, "According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But let each man take heed how he builds upon it .But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble" 3:10, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not know how he received the concept of gold, silver, and precious stones, but this concept is very scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In a previous chapter we have seen that the two ends of the Bible as well as the sections between the ends speak of gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These are the precious materials which are good for the building of God's house, God's city, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church is built only with precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is no clay, burnt brick, or anything wooden or natural.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All the materials have to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Precious stones are not merely created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They are something of God's creation that have passed through a process of being burned and pressed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today we all are under the process of being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Romans 12:2 says that in order to have the Body life we must "be transformed by the renewing of the mind."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many Christians today talk about the Body life according to Romans 12, but they neglect the word transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Without being transformed there is no possibility for us to have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Body life is not something natural; it is not something brought about by our work.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Body life is something of Christ wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, we need transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Every part of our natural being has to be transformed so that we will be no more "wood" but "petrified wood."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the concept of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need a deliverance from teachings and gifts into the enjoyment and eating of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then we will have the growth, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must pray not only for ourselves but for others also.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord is recovering something, but many seeking ones in today's Christianity are short in their concept.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore, pray for them and pray for yourselves that you may receive what is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the Lord's recovery today what is needed is the real enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This Christ is the life-giving Spirit 15:45b , and we all have been made, positioned, to drink of this one Spirit, the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The one Spirit is nothing less than Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is the all-inclusive Christ for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We need this enjoyment.</S>
