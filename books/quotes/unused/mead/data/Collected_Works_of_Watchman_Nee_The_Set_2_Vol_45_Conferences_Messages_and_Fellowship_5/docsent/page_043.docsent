   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-NINE A TALK WITH NEW BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON CONSECRATION Date: December 13, 1940</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Unrecorded</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1; 14:7-9; 1 Cor 6:19-20; 2 Cor 5:14-15; Exo 12:29; 13:1-2; 32:26; Num 3:44-45</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Redemption is a great event in the universe, whereas consecration is a great thing for a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While redemption is God's great act, consecration should be our great act.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I asked, "Is redemption a great thing in the universe?", you will surely say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Redemption is indeed a crucial thing, but consecration is just as crucial as redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In fact, the goal of redemption is achieved through consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Redemption recovers God's lost authority in man, while consecration returns God's lost authority and position in man back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, we can say that redemption and consecration are two sides of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one can be a proper Christian without consecrating himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is vain to exhort, encourage, or inspire others to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Unless a man sees the basis of consecration, he cannot consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once a man sees the basis of consecration, it becomes very spontaneous for him to consecrate himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only those who have seen the basis of consecration will consecrate themselves to the Lord in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul was very clear concerning the basis of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His consecration was an answer to God's compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Chapters one through eight of Romans are on redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Chapters nine through eleven are parenthetical words; the nation of Israel is presented as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Following this, chapter twelve speaks of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The basis of consecration is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First there is redemption, and then there is consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Corinthians 6:19-20 says, "Do you not know that...you are not your own?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For you have been bought with a price.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So then glorify God in your body."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Redemption is the reason and the cause for consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second Corinthians 5:14-15 says, "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These verses say that since the Lord has died for us, we should live to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we see His redemption, we offer up our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must show others what redemption is before we can talk to them about consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a man has not seen redemption, his consecration will be temporary and baseless.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a man does not see redemption, he cannot consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even if he has consecrated himself, his consecration will not be thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Redemption is the greatest subject in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It recovers God's lost right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In God's eyes this world is not only sinful, but lost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Luke 15 does not say that there were a hundred sheep and that one lost its temper; rather, it says that one was lost and missing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It does not say that a woman had ten silver coins and that one became rusty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It says that one was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the parable of the prodigal son, it says that the prodigal son was lost and was as good as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In God's eyes, when man sinned and fell, He lost something.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christians are God's inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God created the universe with the intention that Christ would be the Head over all things and that all things would be made subject to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But a tragedy happened man sinned and fell.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The man that God created became lost; he became someone else's possession.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was a tragedy to God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Would you not feel grieved if your hard-earned monthly salary fell into someone else's hand and was lost?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The same is true with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His greatest grief is His loss of man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man's sins are a secondary issue.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The main issue is that God lost something.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The prodigal son may have made money or squandered money, but he remained a prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Others may have found him to be a good man, even a gentleman, but they would still have to say that he was a lost man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This shows us that the primary goal of redemption does not concern the issue of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is like a watch being pawned to the pawn shop and remaining there for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>During the three years, the owner of the watch has lost his right to the watch.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On man's side redemption means the forgiveness of sins, while on God's side it means God gains something back.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sal- vation is for man to gain something, whereas redemption is for God to gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Redemption brings back to God what He had lost in Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Redemption also tells us that henceforth we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Originally, man belonged to God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Later, he belonged to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now God is redeeming man and recovering him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since redemption means the recovery of man back to God, the matter of consecration immediately follows.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Consecration is man's acknowledgement of God's right in him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is the acknowledgement of God's place in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There are three passages in the Old Testament which provide an understanding of consecration: Exodus 12 13, Exodus 32, and Numbers 8.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Exodus 12 13 provides the most complete type of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On the night of the Passover, all the firstborn were killed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At that time the Israelites were slaves under the domination of foreigners.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They cried out as a result of their suffering, and their cry reached God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God cared for them and promised to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He said that the Israelites were His people, while Pharaoh said that they were his people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God wanted the Israelites to serve Him in the wilderness, but Pharaoh wanted to keep them in Egypt to make bricks and build cities for him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The controversy between God and Pharaoh was centered around to whom the Israelites belonged.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It was not a matter of whether or not the Israelites were going to heaven; it was a matter of to whom the Israelites belonged.</S>
