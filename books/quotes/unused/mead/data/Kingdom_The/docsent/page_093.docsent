   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WATCHING AND PRAYING BY GROWING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians talk about watching and praying, but few realize the real meaning of watching and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The way to watch is simply to grow in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one can be watchful without the proper growth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While you are growing, you are watching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While you are growing, you are preparing the extra portion of the all-inclusive Spirit as the oil in your vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is what it means to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be watchful does not mean that you read the prophecies, study the world situation, and observe the events in Russia, Israel, and the Middle East.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Watching is not a matter of reading newspapers and collecting prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If this is your way of watching, I am afraid that the Lord Jesus will come one day and that you will not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be watchful means to grow with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You need to pray, "Lord Jesus, I am going to the department store.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Will You go with me?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am going shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Will You go with me?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the Lord says, "No, I want to stay home," you should reply, "Lord if You want to stay home, I will stay home, too."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is watching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"O Lord Jesus, I need to get a haircut.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, how long do You want my hair to be?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am one with You.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever You like, that is what I like."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what it means to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I was young, I was taught to watch and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was taught to observe certain events such as the return of Jerusalem to the Jews and then to pray about them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I watched and then I prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But now I realize that to watch and to pray means to grow continually with the Lord, to live together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then you are in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are not only in the kingdom, but you are the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As you grow together with the Lord, you watch and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus is with us and His being with us is His gradual coming.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Revelation 14 reveals the maturity among all the maturities, signified by the number 144,000.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some will be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe that many in the local churches will be mature, but some will be at the top of this maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This topmost maturity will be considered by God to be the 144,000 who will be the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After this comes the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE WAY OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I beg you to take all of these things into your spirit and bring them to the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You will see this as the accurate realization of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not simply a matter of interpretation of prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have studied all the good schools of prophetic interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Probably some of you are familiar with G. H. Pember's books on the great prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We, too, are familiar with them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, those books simply contain doctrines of prophecies; there is not much life there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What the Lord has shown us from His Word is the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even the Lord's second coming is according to the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is the seed, He is the growth, He is the transformation, and He is even the harvest and the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whoever gains Him the most will be at the top of the harvest and will be the firstfruit.</S>
