<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE FALL<br />AND THE SALVATION OF MAN</h2><p>This is where the fall of man began. It is also where man's salvation commences. Christ recognizes the nature of unity of the human life. When the first man sinned, all who came after him sinned as well. Therefore, if another man can be established as a source of life and as the head of a new race, whoever succeeds him will be able to share all he is and all he has done in him.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING SINNED IN ADAM</h2><p>How does the Bible view the fall of mankind? It shows us that due to the unity of men, when the first man Adam sinned, all sinned in him, although none were yet born.</p><p>The way we look at it is whether or not we as individuals have sinned. This is not God's way. Even if I had never sinned from the day I was born, God would ask from whom I came. If I came from Adam, then I was there and took part when Adam sinned in the garden of Eden, even if I have not sinned from the day I was born. According to biological law, my life is communicated from Adam. The latest life is the same as the first life. According to God, everyone from Adam on is a sinner. Adam sinned; so every single person became a sinner in Adam.</p><p>Suppose a man has never sinned (of course, no such person ever existed). God would still reckon him a sinner because his life is a life that sins; he is the offspring of a sinful life. Even though we do not feel that we have the same experience as Adam, the fact is that his life is in man. Up till today we bear this life with us.</p><h2 class="head1">ANOTHER MAN</h2><p>The Bible also shows us another man, Christ. God considers Christ the same way He considers Adam. God counts Adam and everyone from him as one man. In the same way, God considers Christ as the Head and includes everyone who comes out of Him as one man. The life we received from Adam is a life of sin. If we can come out of Christ and receive His life, we can be free from sin in the same manner Jesus was.</p><p>For the present, we will not consider how to receive this life that comes out from Him. We will explain this later. We want to see how the life that comes out of Christ is the very life of Jesus Himself. It is a life without sin, a life that is pleasing to God, filled with the Holy Spirit, and absolutely holy and righteous. When we receive such a life, we will be the same as Christ, having the same experiences He had.</p><h2 class="head1">NO THIRD MAN</h2><p>Hence, there are only two men in the whole of humanity. Either you have your being in Adam or in Christ. If you are not associated with Adam, you have to be associated with Christ. You cannot find a third man. Once someone asked me, "How many people are there in hell?" I told him that there was only one, and that there was also only one in heaven. The man in Christ is in one place, and the man in Adam is in another. This is extremely simple.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO ADAMS, TWO MEN</h2><p>Because the Bible regards the whole of humanity as two men, we will not be surprised if we read 1 Corinthians 15:45 and 47: "So also it is written, `The first man, Adam, became a living soul'; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit...The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven."</p><p>The Bible identifies the first man as Adam. It also identifies Christ as another Adam, the last Adam. This means that there will not be a third Adam. There are only two Adams. How does the Bible count? It counts Adam as the first man and Christ as the second. From Adam to Christ millions of men were born. But the Bible does not count them as individuals. Adam was first. Christ is second.</p><p>Hence, everyone that came out of Adam is included in him. They are all associated with sin; they are all sinful, and they are all earthy. In the same way, those who receive life from the last Adam are included in Christ, having all of Jesus' experiences. Sin has no power over them. They are of heaven.</p><h2 class="head1">AGAIN RELATED TO CHRIST</h2><p>Once again we see that every doctrine we have is related to Christ. Every experience that a Christian will encounter is bound up with Christ. All that the Bible asks of us is to believe in Him, listen to Him, obey Him, and follow Him. The solution to all problems hinges on Him and is found in Him. All we need to do is have Christ Jesus as our life. His experiences will become our experiences. He is the center of our faith. As long as we are attached to Him, everything will be set right.</p><p>Adam is a corporate man, including you and me and everyone inside him. His experiences in the garden of Eden have become ours. His end has become our fate. In the same manner Christ is a corporate man. Everyone in Christ has the same relationship with Him as they formerly had with Adam. Every experience of Christ becomes the experience of those in Him. The whole of humanity is bound up within these two men and intimately related to them.</p>
