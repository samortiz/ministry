These include the economy of God, Christ, the Spirit, the transformation of the believers, and the Body of Christ. God's dispensing is involved in each of these great revelations. Without knowing these five revelations, it is impossible to know the dispensing of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Economy</H2><P>The first of the five great revelations in the New Testament is God's economy (1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 1:10; 3:9). The Greek word oikonomia, translated economy, means "household administration" or "household economy." In the entire Bible, this word is used in reference to God's economy only by the apostle Paul. Even the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels did not use this word. The word oikonomia is great in significance because it refers to God's eternal purpose according to His heart's desire.</P><P>Some have said that the apostles' teaching, mentioned in Acts 2:42, includes only the teachings that the Lord Jesus gave to the twelve apostles while He was on this earth. However, in John 16 the Lord told His disciples clearly that He had many things to say to them, but they could not bear them at that time (v. 12). Then He told them to wait until the coming of the Comforter, the Spirit of reality, who would receive the things of the Lord Jesus and declare them to the disciples (vv. 13-15). According to my study of the Bible, the Lord's word here was fulfilled mainly with the apostle Paul. He was nearly the unique one who received the Lord's further revelation concerning the economy of God. In Paul's fourteen Epistles, the first great revelation concerns not God alone but God in His economy. God's economy, God's eternal plan, is revealed especially in the four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. In the ministry in recent years, we have paid particular attention to the matter of God's economy.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_146.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_148.html">Next</a> </body></html>
