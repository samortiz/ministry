[1]  John 4:24 says, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.
[2]  It is through the Holy Spirit that we are able to have these three in s. First John 4:13 states, In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.
[3]  When God gives us the Holy Spirit, there are two issues: one is that we abide in Him, and the other is that He abides in us.
[4]  Every matter or thing has its origin, nature, and expression.
[5]  God Himself is the uncreated, eternal Spirit, and in order for this uncreated, eternal Spirit to come into man, God created a spirit for man.
[6]  John 1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God v. 1 . The Word s becoming flesh v. 14 is God s becoming flesh.
[7]  John 6:63 says, It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.
[8]  Here the Lord tells us that the words which He has spoken to us are spirit, meaning that the Word is spirit.
[9]  John 14:17-20 says, Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
[10]  Ephesians 3:16-17 and 19 say, That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love...may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[11]  This portion mentions three things first, that God would grant us to be strengthened through His Spirit into our inner man; second, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith; and third, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[12]  Outwardly speaking, He was indeed a man, but inwardly He was truly God.
[13]  God s mingling with man began with this God-man Jesus Christ.
[14]  When the Lord was on the earth, although inwardly He was Spirit, outwardly He was flesh, a Nazarene.
[15]  As such, the Spirit within was restricted by the flesh without.
[16]  After the Lord s resurrection, the Bible calls Him the Spirit.
[17]  The Lord who became flesh, who died and resurrected, and who was glorified is now the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .
[18]  The Spirit is God Himself, and the Lord is the Spirit.
[19]  The Spirit referred to here, however, is different from the uncreated, eternal Spirit, because in this Spirit referred to here there is both divinity and humanity.
[20]  After the apostle John saw the vision of the church, he saw the scene in the heavens.
[21]  He saw the throne in heaven, and upon the throne God was sitting and administrating the whole universe.
[22]  THE ISSUE OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD REACHING MAN AND HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN
[23]  Fire is fearful, but if fire becomes a lamp, it is no longer fearful.
[24]  Our God is a consuming fire, but when He comes to have a relationship with man, and when He comes forth through His Spirit, He is like a lamp of fire that shines on us and is to us whatever we need.
[25]  Moreover, after Christ s death and resurrection, He ascended to God, and His seven lamps became the seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God.
[26]  The fire shines forth from the lamps, the lamps are diffused through the eyes, this diffusion is the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God is sent forth into all the earth.
[27]  A CHRISTIAN S LIVING, PATH, AND EVERYTHING COMING FROM THE SHINING AND BURNING
[28]  THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT GOD DESIRING TO BE MINGLED WITH MAN
[29]  The center of the entire Bible is that God wants to work Himself into man to the extent that He is fully mingled with man.
[30]  In other words, He desires that His divinity would be mingled with humanity and humanity would be mingled with His divinity, so that God and man, man and God would be fully mingled as one.
[31]  Even though divinity and humanity are two entirely different natures, the work of God throughout all the generations is to work these two natures into one, that divinity may be in humanity, and humanity in divinity, to the extent that you would not be able to see God without seeing man or see man without seeing God.
[32]  We all know that the One on the throne is God, because the seven Spirits which come forth out of the throne are the seven Spirits of God v. 5 . Moreover, in the midst of the One sitting on the throne and the seven Spirits which come forth out of the throne, is a Lamb standing as having just been slain 5:6 . Who is the Lamb standing as having just been slain? He is Christ, the Son of God.
[33]  In Revelation 4 we see that the One who is on the throne is God, and the One who comes out of the throne is the Spirit.
[34]  Wherever the seven Spirits look, there is blessing and there is the shining of God s lamps of fire, and wherever God s lamps of fire shine, there is the burning of the fire of God.
[35]  This clearly indicates that the glory of the city is the glory of God, the light of the city is the light of God, the color of the city is the color of God, and the appearance of the city is the same as the appearance of God.
[36]  As a result of being saved and regenerated, we have God s life, the pearl gates, and the street of pure gold in us, but the question is, do we have the jasper wall?
[37]  The Holy Spirit is working in us continuously to work the image of God into us, and the result of this work is that we become exactly the same as God.
[38]  The One who is making us jasper is the jasper One on the throne.
[39]  God s throne is His reigning, and out of His sovereign reigning comes forth fire Rev 4:5 .
[40]  Because of this, when we taste the visitation and grace of God, our first inner feeling is that God s eyes are looking at our inner being.
[41]  Romans 8:9-11 says, But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[42]  Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.
[43]  And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.
[44]  When the Holy Spirit looks at a person, the lamps of the fire of God shine upon him, and when the lamps of fire shine upon him, the consuming fire of God burns within him.
[45]  This consuming fire is both God Himself and the Spirit, because God Himself is both a consuming fire and the Spirit.
[46]  Through this looking, shining, and burning, God who is in Christ, and Christ who is in the Holy Spirit are wrought into us.
[47]  As a result, we receive the element of the Holy Spirit, the element of Christ, and the element of God.
[48]  From the day that we are regenerated onward, God not only lives within us but also moves and works within us in many ways in order to bring our soul and body into God.
[49]  Although we have a spirit, and the Spirit of God is also in us, we may be living entirely by our soul we may still make decisions and love, hate, and think by ourselves.
[50]  This is the case not only with our mind and will but also with our emotion.
[51]  Many times, the love even among the brothers is soulish, emotional, and fleshly, and the love among the sisters is entirely outside of the Holy Spirit and is not controlled or ruled by the Holy Spirit.
[52]  The Holy Spirit s blessing and working in us are to bring us into God so that our entire being our mind, emotion, and will will be brought into God and directed and ruled by the Spirit.
[53]  John 16:13 says, But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality.
[54]  This verse does not speak merely of understanding the truth but of being guided by the Spirit of reality into all the reality.
[55]  God has a purpose in this universe, and this purpose is to mingle Himself with man to the extent that man would be exactly the same as He is.
[56]  God is Spirit His essence, nature, and being are Spirit.
[57]  Only in this way can God s Spirit be mingled with the human spirit, interact with the human spirit, and be joined with the human spirit as one spirit.
[58]  At that time He was purely God, purely Spirit, and there was nothing other than the element of God and Spirit in Him and on Him.
[59]  The One who descended was the Holy Spirit; however, the Holy Spirit who descended was not the God before incarnation but the God who possessed additional elements to those He originally possessed.
[60]  It may be the case that we are often touched by the Lord s great love that was manifested in His redemption.
[61]  If we know the mystery that everything is in the Spirit, we will realize that all the questions that we do not know how to answer can be answered by the Holy Spirit.
[62]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE SPIRIT FOR LIVING THE CHRISTIAN LIVING BEING A LIFE
[63]  Hence, the normal Christian living is not a living that is independent or outside of God.
[64]  In the first instance, the Spirit and life are connected together in the phrase, It is the Spirit who gives life.
[65]  This means that when God is in His dwelling place, He is God, but when He comes out of His heavenly sanctuary and works on the earth to contact man, He is the Spirit who can be touched by man.
[66]  In other words, God in Himself is God, but whenever He comes out of Himself to the earth to work, to contact man, and even to enter into man, what man touches is the Spirit.
[67]  I hope that every Christian would be clear that the relationship God desires to have with us is a relationship in which He as the Spirit enters into our spirit and in which we saved ones live in this spirit.
[68]  Moreover, the Spirit of life, which is spoken of in Romans 8:2, is also referred to as the Spirit who gives life v. 11 . Romans 8 says that to touch the Spirit is to touch life and that the mind set on the spirit is life and peace v. 6 . These verses show us that the Bible links life and the Holy Spirit together.
[69]  In Romans 8 he said that by setting our mind on the spirit we touch life and that the mind set on the spirit is life v. 6 . In 1 John 5 the apostle John even said, He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life v. 12 . If we combine all these verses together, we can see that life is the Lord Himself.
[70]  Perhaps some people may ask why it is not enough to say that God is God.
[71]  When God was in the sanctuary, before He came to have a relationship with man, He was purely God.
[72]  When God comes out and reaches man, He is the Spirit, and when the Spirit is received and touched by us, He is life.
[73]  Psalm 36 says that with God is the fountain of life v. 9 . The Gospel of John mentions that this life is in Christ Jesus and that He is the life 1:4; 11:25 . Then the Epistles tell us that it is the Spirit who gives life 2 Cor 3:6 , that the Spirit is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , and that when we touch the Spirit, we touch life.
[74]  CHAPTER NINE THE SPIRIT BEING OUR LIFE HAVING SPIRITUAL REALITY
[75]  THE SPIRITUAL LIFE BEING EXPRESSED ONLY WHEN THE HUMAN SPIRIT TOUCHES THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[76]  Genuine spiritual living is the issue or expression that is produced by our spirit touching the Spirit of God.
[77]  When our spirit touches the Spirit, the issue or expression is our humility, our meekness, our prayer, our love toward the saints, and our visiting the saints.
[78]  When all these human virtues are expressed in our daily living as the issue of the Spirit of God touching our spirit, they are spiritual reality and the genuine spiritual living.
[79]  God as the Spirit comes to contact us, and when the Spirit enters into us to be touched and experienced by us, He becomes our spiritual life.
[80]  CHAPTER TEN HOW TO LIVE A PRACTICAL SPIRITUAL LIFE A PRACTICAL SPIRITUAL LIFE
[81]  Ephesians 3:17 says that Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith in order that, as verse 19 says, we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[82]  The issue of Christ s making His home in our hearts is that we are filled unto all the fullness of God.
[83]  The unique goal that God desires to accomplish in us who are saved is to work Himself into us and to work us into Him so that He and we, we and He, would be mingled as one.
[84]  This means that the proper and genuine Christian living is the living that issues from our spirit touching the Spirit of God.
[85]  The way we conduct ourselves in our life, our living, our work, and all of our actions should be the issue of our spirit touching the Spirit of God and not the issue of our relying on ourselves.
[86]  Actually, those who truly know the Lord s salvation and live in spiritual reality by the grace of God have their living mingled together with God.
[87]  Our living may be upright and ethical, but is our walk and upright condition produced by our spirit touching the Spirit of God, or is it unnecessary for us to touch the Spirit of God in order to have such a living?
[88]  Before we were saved and had God dwelling in us, it seemed sufficient for us merely to do good.
[89]  Gradually, however, we will begin to learn not to live by ourselves but to turn to our spirit and to think of God in our living.
[90]  Eventually we will reach a point where we may not even deliberately exercise our spirit to touch the Spirit of God; because our heart is proper and because we are always in fellowship with God and because of His moving within us, we will spontaneously touch the Spirit of God.
[91]  But now that we see that deep within us we have a spirit and that the Spirit of God is in our spirit, when we fellowship and contact God in our spirit, the Spirit of God will touch our spirit, and eventually we will obey and follow the feeling in our spirit.
[92]  Our problem is that it is not easy for us to turn from the outward to the inward, that is, from our soul to our spirit.
[93]  If we always exercise in our daily life to deny our soul and live in our spirit to fellowship with God, then when something happens to us, it will be easy for us to touch God s desire within.
[94]  OF THE UNION OF GOD AND MAN Scripture Reading: Matt 1:23; John 14:20-23; 17:21-23; 1 John 3:24; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:9-10; Eph 3:17a, 19b; Col 2:9-10a; Rev 21:1-3 SERVING THE LORD
[95]  All those who serve God according to their natural insight cannot truly serve or touch God.
[96]  In the evening of the Lord Jesus resurrection, He came into the midst of the disciples and breathed Himself into them, saying, Receive the Holy Spirit 20:22 .
[97]  He was not bound by time or space; for instance, the Lord was able to enter into the midst of the disciples even though the doors were shut v. 19 , and after He talked with the two disciples who were going to Emmaus and reclined at table with them, He suddenly disappeared from them Luke 24:30-31 . Thus, we must see that from the day of the Lord Jesus resurrection, His presence with the disciples progressed from being merely outward to being inward, from being visible to being invisible, and from being limited by time and space to being outside of time and space.
[98]  In John 20 the Lord breathed into the disciples v. 22 . This fulfilled what He had spoken earlier: In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you 14:20 . This was also the fulfillment of what He had prayed to the Father concerning being in the disciples that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me 17:23 . The Gospel of John mentions several in s. Chapter fourteen verse 10 reveals that the Father is in the Lord.
[99]  When Philip asked the Lord, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us v. 8 , the Lord answered, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me? v. 9 . Outwardly the Lord was a Nazarene, but inwardly He was the Father.
[100]  The purpose of God s work in man is this one thing to work Himself into man.
[101]  Whenever we disregard our mind, ignore our thoughts, and use our deepest part to touch God and to pray to God, we are filled with God.
[102]  In preaching the gospel, most people speak much about the Lord s coming but not about His going.
[103]  The Lord Jesus Himself said, But I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you John 16:7 .
[104]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN DEATH AND RESURRECTION 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:9-11; Eph 1:19-23; Phil 3:10 THE MINGLING OF DIVINITY AND HUMANITY
[105]  Through His incarnation He brought God into man, and through His death and resurrection He brought man into God.
[106]  The principle of death and resurrection is to bring man into God.
[107]  It is incorrect, however, to say that a person who has passed through death and resurrection is absolutely devoid of the human element, having only the divine element.
[108]  A person who has passed through death and resurrection is one who has been mingled with God.
[109]  In His death and resurrection the Lord Jesus did not put off the humanity that had restricted, bound, and limited Him.
[110]  In the thirty-three and a half years that the Lord Jesus was on the earth before His death and resurrection, He lived a human life that was filled with divinity inwardly and that expressed God spontaneously, and after His resurrection when He appeared to His disciples, what He expressed was God s living.
[111]  When we truly know death and resurrection, many things will happen to us.
[112]  We all know that all the Epistles written by Peter, John, Paul, and James are parts of the Word of God.
[113]  However, when we read the Epistles of Paul, we find that the flavor of Paul s Epistles is absolutely different from that of Peter s Epistles, and the flavor of the Epistles of John is altogether different from the flavor of the Epistle of James.
[114]  What each of them wrote was the Word of God, but when we read the Epistles of John, we sense John s flavor, when we read the Epistles of Peter, we sense Peter s flavor, when we read the Epistle of James, we sense James flavor, and when we read the Epistles of Paul, we sense Paul s flavor.
[115]  Hence, Paul s speaking was God s speaking, Peter s speaking was God s speaking, James speaking was God s speaking, and John s speaking was God s speaking.
[116]  Death and resurrection do not put man aside or nullify man but bring man into God.
[117]  In eternity future God will see many different faces with many different personalities and kinds of humanity joined as one in His divinity.
[118]  In eternity, in the last poem of God, we will see that the brothers will have the brothers flavor, but at the same time they will all have the glory of God, and the sisters will have the sisters flavor, but at the same time they will also have the glory of God.
[119]  One day we will all see a beautiful scene in which there will be all kinds of people with various characteristics in all the churches, yet all of them will have entered into God, will be living in God, and will have the flavor and glory of God.
[120]  Just as incarnation brings God into man to live a human life with the flavor of God, so death and resurrection bring man into God to live God s life with the existence of man.
[121]  Therefore, on the one hand, while we need to have our own personality, on the other hand we all have to learn to allow the Holy Spirit to bring our personality into God.
[122]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN DEATH AND RESURRECTION 2 Scripture Reading: John 7:39; Acts 2:32-33; Rom 1:4; John 11:25; 2 Cor 3:17 THE CROSS BEING THE LORD S DEATH
[123]  It is easy for people to comprehend that incarnation is God s coming to be a man, but most people do not truly understand the matter of death and resurrection.
[124]  There are also seven lamps of fire before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God, the Holy Spirit 4:2, 5 .
[125]  As the Holy Spirit, the resurrected and ascended Christ came to the earth to contact man, to be touched by man, to fellowship with man, and to be received by man.
[126]  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Question: After Christ was resurrected, He could no longer die, yet with us, we live in the Holy Spirit one day but live in the flesh another day.
[127]  Does this mean that resurrection can be changed in our experience?
[128]  In this situation the Spirit of God reigns in us and dominates us, directing our mind, emotion, and will in order to bring our spirit under the ruling of the Spirit of God.
[129]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN EXPERIENCING DEATH AND RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Matt 22:31-32; 1 Cor 15:4-5, 8-11; 2 Cor 4:7-11; Phil 3:10; Eph 1:19-23 THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN THE OLD TESTAMENT HAVING NO ELEMENT OF HUMANITY
[130]  Thus, at that time the Spirit of God had only the divine element of God, not the human element of man or the element of resurrection.
[131]  In the Old Testament God had not yet been incarnated and had not yet passed through death and resurrection.
[132]  Thus, when the Spirit of God came out in the Old Testament, He did not have the elements of humanity and resurrection.
[133]  In other words, the Spirit in the Old Testament age was solely the Spirit of God, not the Spirit of death and resurrection.
[134]  We have already seen that resurrection is the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit bears resurrection, resurrection is in the Holy Spirit, and ascension is also in the Holy Spirit.
[135]  If you would live in the spirit, I would live in the spirit, and all of us would live in the spirit, subjecting our mind, emotion, and will to the ruling and direction of the spirit, then we would all be in resurrection and under the ruling of the spirit.
[136]  IN THE SPIRIT OF RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Rom 6:5, 13; 8:11; Acts 2:33, 36; Eph 1:20-22.
[137]  Hence, if we want to touch God and everything of God, we must touch the Holy Spirit, because God Himself and all that He has accomplished have been aggregated in the Holy Spirit.
[138]  When we touch the Holy Spirit, we live in resurrection, and only when we are living in resurrection will we have various spiritual experiences.
[139]  On the one hand, the Lord s living was not the living of the mingling of God and man because the Lord had not yet died and resurrected, and man had not yet entered into God.
[140]  Our Christian living is a living in which we first die then live.
[141]  From then on, God s goal is to share one living with us, a living of man being mingled with God.
[142]  WATER AND FIRE Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9b-10a; 3:24; Dan 7:9-10; Luke 12:49-51; John 7:38-39; 1 Cor 10:4; Rev 4:5; 22:1-2
[143]  God predestinated them that they would be conformed to the image of the Son of God v. 29 . God chose us, predestinated us, and called us for the purpose that we would be conformed to the image of His Son.
[144]  Second Corinthians 3:18 says, But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
[145]  After we are saved, the Holy Spirit works in us that we may be transformed into the image of the Lord.
[146]  This transformation is of the Lord s Spirit and is the work of the Holy Spirit in us.
[147]  The Holy Spirit will continuously work in us until we are completely transformed and even our body is redeemed and conformed to the Lord s body of glory.
[148]  Hence, at the end of Revelation, we see that all God s redeemed people are like jasper stone, being exactly the same as the image of God.
[149]  Perhaps some people are not able to take this word, thinking that, regardless of how much we have been saved, man is still man, and God is still God, and man cannot be saved to the degree that he will be the same as God.
[150]  Apart from life, there is no other way for God to accomplish this goal of making man the same as He is.
[151]  Only through the way of life can God s life be wrought into man to operate, transform, and cause a metabolic reaction in man, so that man may be transformed and become the same as God.
[152]  In Genesis 1 when man is mentioned, the image of God is also mentioned v. 26 . Then in chapter two when man is mentioned again, immediately life is mentioned v. 7 . Only when God s life enters into man can man have the genuine image of God.
[153]  This life is water, this life is fire, and this life is also the Holy Spirit.
[154]  The Spirit is one, and this life also is one, but in the matter of supplying, this life is sometimes like water and sometimes like fire.
[155]  When this life waters and supplies us inwardly, it enables us to touch the presence of God and transforms us so that our mind, emotion, and will are like God s. At the same time, this life also burns in us, burning away our flesh, self, and corruption.
[156]  In this way we experience the presence of God so that what we think, what we love, what we incline to, and what we desire match the condition of God.
[157]  That which comes from God and the Lamb is the Spirit, and the Spirit enters into us as life, the life of God.
[158]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN REVELATION AND EXPERIENCE Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17-23; 3:16-19
[159]  We can see the matter of prayer throughout the entire New Testament.
[160]  In the prayer in chapter one, the apostle asks God for spiritual revelation that we may see that God has to work in us to the extent that we become the inheritance of His glory.
[161]  In the prayer in chapter three, the apostle asks God to strengthen us through His Spirit into our inner man that we may experience the power in us which has already been manifested.
[162]  Ephesians 1:19-23 says, And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
[163]  Then in chapter three the apostle prayed that God, according to this revelation, would grant us the experience, because it is one thing for God to work something out in us, but it is another thing for us to experience it personally.
[164]  God and we, we and God, will be completely mingled together, and we will be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[165]  The first prayer is for a spirit of wisdom and revelation 1:17-18 .
[166]  THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING PRODUCED FROM RESURRECTION
[167]  THE CHURCH AND THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING ON OUR LIVING IN THE SPIRIT
[168]  Paul prayed that God would strengthen us into our inner man that we would be full of strength.
[169]  The Holy Spirit in us strengthens us with power that the indwelling Christ may make home in us and that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
