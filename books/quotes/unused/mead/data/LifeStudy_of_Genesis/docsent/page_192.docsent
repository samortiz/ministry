   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning God's Desire</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God not only has an intention, but also a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God does intend to do something and He is also hungry and thirsty for this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God desires to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1933 a good pastor came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not call me Brother Lee; he addressed me as Mr. Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He said, "Mr. Lee, if you would not have the church and just minister the Word, we all would invite you to speak in our churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We would make the arrangements for you to rotate the year round from church to church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you would close the door of your meeting place, disband the people who meet with you, and simply preach the Word, we would all open our doors to you."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I said, "Thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have my burden and I have enough to do."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I went to Taiwan, a missionary came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Firstly, he praised me very much, saying, "Brother Lee, how we thank God that He has used you and how we thank Him that He has raised up such a wonderful work on the island of Taiwan."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While he was praising me, I knew what he was going to say next.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He continued by saying something about the church in a dissenting way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some of the missionaries in the Far East considered our church practice as "the dead fly in the ointment."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some said to me, "If you don't talk anymore about the church, you will be welcomed by all Christians."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I said, "Sorry, it does not depend on me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord has burdened me so."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I used to say to them, "We are grateful to you brothers who came from countries afar off for the gospel, especially to those pioneers a century ago who came to China after a six-month voyage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We appreciate the fact that you have given up your country, your family, your home, and everything to come here to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But our burden is not only for the gospel, but also for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God needs the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Gospel preaching should be for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We also preach the gospel, as you know, but our goal in doing so is the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sorry to say, it seems to us that you do not care for this goal that God has shown us."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was invited to visit London and Denmark in 1958.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I cannot tell you how warm a welcome they extended to me in both places.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, most of the leading ones were displeased with me over the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some friendships in the Lord which had been deep were severed just because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of my standing for the church life according to what the Lord has shown us, a number of the saints whom I know have deserted me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have not the slightest doubt that time will tell that the church life is what God desires to have today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I came to Los Angeles in 1962 to stay with the brothers for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that time, I told that small group of brothers to wait for five or ten years and they would see something.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today I say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that the Lord will come back soon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In case that He delays, I ask you to wait for another ten years and see what will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord is going to take this country and the other leading countries for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We all need to see the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all must have today's revelation to see what is God's heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are you going to be today's Noah?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are, you must see what Noah did.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's desire is not only that thousands of people be saved, but to have the wonderful church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How we thank God for all the saints who have been used by God in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have been greatly helped by their life and work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we believe that in this age the Lord has shown us something more.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do follow the godly ways of all of our forefathers in the Lord, but the Lord's revelation has brought us further in His goings on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This revelation of the Lord surely has made us different from the dear ones who remain in the traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord have mercy upon us that we would be faithful to His revelation, not caring about being different from others.</S>
