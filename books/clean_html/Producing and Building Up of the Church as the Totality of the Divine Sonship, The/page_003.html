<h2 class="head1">BEING PREDESTINATED UNTO SONSHIP</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 says, &ldquo;Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; This is a deep matter. To be predestinated is to be pre-marked, marked out before we were born or even created. It is as if God saw us in eternity and said, &ldquo;I like this one.&rdquo; Before the foundation of the world, God looked at us, selected us, and put a mark on us. We cannot recognize the mark, but God and all His angels can. Wherever we go, all the angels can see that we are those who have been marked out by God. The so-called scientific people may say that this is a mere superstition. However, it is no superstition; it is a fact. Day and night there is a mark on us.</p>
<p>Again, according to the natural concept, many Christians may say that God has predestinated us unto salvation. I too held this concept for many years. I read Ephesians many times, but I did not see the divine sonship. However, one day the Lord opened my eyes to see the divine sonship. Salvation is easy to understand, but sonship is not. God predestinated us not merely for salvation but even more for sonship. Sonship means that God makes us His sons. Once we were only God&rsquo;s creation. At that time we were not born of Him, but now we are born of God (John 1:12-13). When I was young, Christian pastors and evangelists would tell us that we need God&rsquo;s salvation because we are fallen. In their thought, if we were not fallen, we would not need salvation. However, even if we had never sinned and fallen, we still would not be sons of God. At best, we would be a humanly perfect item of God&rsquo;s creation. God&rsquo;s intention is not simply to create us but to make us His sons. In God&rsquo;s predestination He marked us out in order to make us sons, those who are born of Him to have His life, nature, and all that He is. This is the proper meaning of sonship.</p>

Being a Corporate Entity</h2>
<p>The divine sonship is not merely an individual matter. It is not simply that you become one son of God, I become another son of God, and others become many other sons of God individually. Rather, the divine sonship is corporate. The Bible tells us that God has many sons. Originally, Christ was the unique, only begotten Son of God (v. 14, 18; 3:16; 1 John 4:9), but now He is the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:6). Hebrews 2:10 says that God is leading many sons into glory, and verse 11 says that Christ, the firstborn Son, is not ashamed to call them brothers. Today God has not only one Son but many sons corporately. A family is a corporate entity. All the brothers in a family should be one because they are all of one father. One person by himself cannot be a family. A bachelor, for example, has only himself, not an actual family. A couple with one child is a family, and a family like that of Jacob, who had twelve sons and one daughter, is a much greater family. The divine sonship is a corporate entity that eventually becomes the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2, 7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Divine Sonship Being<br />
the Mingling of God with Man</h2>
<p>The church is the totality of the divine sonship. Originally, Jesus Christ as the unique Son of God was the individual expression of God. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; This expression of God by the individual Son, Jesus Christ, was a perfect expression, but it did not fulfill God&rsquo;s goal. God&rsquo;s goal is to have the totality of the divine sonship. As the redeemed, forgiven, saved, and regenerated sons of God, we have the divine nature of God (2 Pet. 1:4). Some may wonder how we as mere human beings can have the divine nature, and some have spoken evilly of this as an &ldquo;evolution into God.&rdquo; Such a speaking is in darkness, without any revelation. If by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we receive revelation, we will see that God has put His divine nature into the believers. We may compare this to the addition of tea to a glass of plain water. When we place a tea bag into water, the tea becomes mingled with the water to become tea-water. Once tea is mingled with water, we no longer call it water; we call it tea. However, we do not mean that it is only tea. Rather, it is tea mingled with water.</p>
<p>According to the facts of the Bible, God has mingled His divine nature with us to make us divine. When plain water is saturated with tea to have the element, color, appearance, and taste of tea, we may say that the water is &ldquo;teaified.&rdquo; The water remains water, but now it is saturated with the tea. In the same way, when God puts Himself into us, He sanctifies us. Because we have been born of God, we now have God&rsquo;s divine life and divine nature. This does not mean we are no longer human. We are still human, but we are humanity mingled with divinity. We do not preach &ldquo;evolution into God.&rdquo; God is God, and we are human beings. Nevertheless, God has put His divine nature into our being. Therefore, we are sons of God with the divine life and the divine nature. The divine life and the divine nature are the very elements of the divine sonship, which is the church. The church is not merely human; it also has the divine element. If we were all only human, we would not be the church. We would be a human society. The church is absolutely different from a human society or a religious organization. The church is something human, yet it is saturated and permeated with the divine nature. Because the church has the divine element, everything in it is holy and without blemish. Therefore, we should not look at ourselves. In ourselves we are unholy and full of blemishes. We must have a heavenly view. We have been chosen to be holy and without blemish, and we have been predestinated, pre-marked, to be the sons of God. This does not mean that from now on we are no longer human beings. We are still human beings, but another element has been added into our &ldquo;plain water&rdquo; to &ldquo;teaify us,&rdquo; that is, to sanctify us.</p>
