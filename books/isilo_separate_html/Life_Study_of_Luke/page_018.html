Verse 8 says, &ldquo;And there were shepherds in the same country, living in the fields and keeping the nightwatches over their flock.&rdquo; Their work in shepherding the flock (which provided not only food for man but also offerings to God) and their diligence in keeping the nightwatches qualified them to be the first to receive the good news of the wonderful birth of the Savior announced by the angel. When the angel of the Lord stood by the shepherds and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, they feared greatly (2:9). Literally, the Greek words rendered &ldquo;feared greatly&rdquo; mean feared a great fear.</p><p>In verses 10 and 11 the angel said to the shepherds, &ldquo;Do not fear, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy, which will be to all the people, because a Savior was born to you today in David&rsquo;s city, who is Christ the Lord.&rdquo; This good news of great joy was announced to all people. This means that this news was announced not only to the Jewish people but to all of mankind.</p><p>In verse 12 the angel went on to say, &ldquo;And this is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.&rdquo; A baby in a manger, signifying smallness in lowliness, was a sign of the Man-Savior&rsquo;s life. This little baby is called the mighty God in the prophecy concerning the Man-Savior (Isa. 9:6).</p><h2 class="head2">A Multitude of the Heavenly Army<br />Joining the Angel and Praising God</h2><p>Luke 2:13 and 14 say, &ldquo;And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying, Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure.&rdquo; The exultation of the angels, who were excited by the birth of the Savior for man&rsquo;s salvation (see 15:7), resulted in praise to God. According to verse 14, the coming of the Savior rendered glory to God in the heavens and brought peace to men on earth. In verse 14 &ldquo;men of His good pleasure&rdquo; are men chosen by God according to His good pleasure (Eph. 1:5).</p><p>The praise of the heavenly army has two aspects: glory in the highest places to God and peace among men on earth. The salvation of the Man-Savior has accomplished these two matters. It has brought glory to God in the highest and peace to men on earth. Christ is for God&rsquo;s glory and man&rsquo;s peace.</p><h2 class="head2">Witnessed by the Shepherds<br />and Spoken of to Others by Them</h2><p>In 2:15-20 we are told that the shepherds went to Bethlehem and &ldquo;found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger&rdquo; (v. 16). The good news concerning the Man-Savior&rsquo;s birth was first announced by an angel to the shepherds. We may say that the angel preached the gospel to them. Then the shepherds, after hearing the preaching of the angel and after coming to see the little child, began to preach to others. Verse 18 says, &ldquo;And all those who heard marveled concerning the things spoken to them by the shepherds.&rdquo; After seeing the Child Jesus, &ldquo;the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken to them&rdquo; (v. 20).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
