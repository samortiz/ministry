   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE MOVE OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOSPEL SERVICE 7 Scripture Reading: Mark 7:31 8:26</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider 7:31 8:26.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this section of the Gospel of Mark five matters are covered: the healing of a deaf and dumb man 7:31-37 , the feeding of four thousand 8:1-9 , not giving a sign to the Pharisees 8:10-13 , warning the disciples concerning the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod 8:14-21 , and the healing of a blind man in Bethsaida 8:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE HEALING OF A DEAF AND DUMB MAN</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 7:31-37 we have the healing of a deaf and dumb man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before chapter seven, most of the healings in the Gospel of Mark were healings of a complete person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For instance, Peter s mother-in-law was sick of a fever 1:30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She was healed, and that was the healing of a complete person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another example of this kind of healing is the healing of the paralytic 2:3-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the paralytic was healed, the complete person was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The same is true of the cleansing of the leper 1:40-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in 7:31-37 we do not have the healing of a complete person; instead, we have the healing of specific organs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In fact, all the healings after Mark 7 involve particular organs, not complete persons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Mainly these healings are of three organs: the eyes, the ears, and the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may say that in the Gospel of Mark we have the following sequence related to healing: general healings, the exposure of the condition of man s heart, the Lord as bread, as the supply of life, and the healing of specific organs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This also is the sequence in our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we were saved, we experienced healing in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later the condition of our heart was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then, probably after coming into the church life, we learned to enjoy the Lord inwardly as our bread, as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Following this, we have the healing of our ears, tongue, and eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some who have been in the church life for years still need the specific healing of these organs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Unable to Hear the Voice of God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>and Speak for Him</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mark 7:32 says, And they bring to Him one who was deaf and spoke with difficulty, and they entreated Him that He would lay His hand on him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This deaf and dumb person signifies one who is spiritually deaf and dumb, one who is unable to hear the voice of God and praise Him Isa 35:6 and speak for Him Isa 56:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His dumbness was due to his deafness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Slave-Savior s healing salvation is fully able to heal such a one s deafness and dumbness by dealing with his ears first and then touching his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verses 33 and 34 say, And taking him away from the crowd privately, He put His fingers into his ears, and spitting, He touched his tongue; and looking up into heaven, He groaned and said to him, Ephphatha! that is, Be opened!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Greek word rendered put in verse 33 may also be translated thrust.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Slave-Savior s thrusting His fingers into the deaf one s ears signifies His dealing with his hearing organ see Isa 50:4-5; Job 33:14-16 , and His touching of his tongue with His spittle signifies His anointing the dumb one s speaking organ with the word that proceeds out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was a healing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A Portrait of Our Condition</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The deaf and dumb man in 7:31-37 portrays our condition today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 32 tells us that this one spoke with difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is it not your situation that in the church meetings you speak with difficulty?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I believe many among us will admit that they have difficulty speaking in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the case of the deaf and dumb man in chapter seven depicts the need of us all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Deafness is often the cause of dumbness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In many cases, a person who is deaf is also dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason for this is that speaking is based on hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A child learns to talk by listening to others speak.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, a child speaks what he hears.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By this we see that a child learns to speak by listening.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may say that his hearing becomes his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you know why we speak with difficulty in the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We speak with difficulty because we are careless in listening to the Lord s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we were more careful in our hearing, we would speak spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to practice listening to the Lord s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we listen to the Word, it will penetrate our being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we shall be able to speak fluently.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But many cannot speak without difficulty because they do not hear properly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we take care of listening to the Word of God, this listening eventually will become our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes the leading ones in the church encourage the saints to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But when some try to speak, they seem to have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The problem is with their hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Apart from listening to the Word, we do not have anything to say in the meetings.</S>
