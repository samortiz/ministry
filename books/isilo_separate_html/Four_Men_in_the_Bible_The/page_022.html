<h1 class="title">KEEPING THE GROUND OF ONENESS<br />
TO BE DELIVERED FROM DIVISION AND CONFUSION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 12, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 17:4-5; Gen. 11:9; Deut. 12:5-7; Ezra 1:1-6; Acts 2:14; 1 Cor. 1:10-12; Rev. 21:2, 18, 21</h1>
<p>In the preceding chapters we saw that the revelation in the Bible is altogether related to the Spirit of God and the human spirit. After God accomplished creation and man fell, God was manifested in the flesh in order to accomplish redemption through His death on the cross, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. When man opens to the Lord, the Spirit, as the all-inclusive Spirit, enters into man&rsquo;s spirit to be one with him. When the Holy Spirit and our human spirit become one spirit, we are mingled as one spirit with Him. In our living today, we need to exercise to live by our spirit and serve by our spirit. I believe that all the saints are clear about this truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SYMBOL OF TWO WOMEN IN REVELATION</h2>
<p>I would like to fellowship about another crucial matter in this chapter, laying a basic truth before you concerning the way that you should take in your service to the Lord for your whole life. If you know this basic truth, it will become a compass to guide you and guard you on your life&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>There are two names in the Bible that represent two principles and two ways: Jerusalem and Babylon. Each of these names is symbolized by women. Revelation 17 and 18 speak of Babylon as a harlot (17:5; 18:2-3), and chapters 19 and 21 speak of Jerusalem as a wife and bride (19:7; 21:2). Babylon is represented by a woman in a negative sense as a harlot. Being a harlot is even more negative than being an adulteress. An adulteress is a woman who has unlawful contact with a man other than her husband, whereas a harlot is a woman who contacts men loosely and does not even have a husband. Verse 5 of chapter 17 says, &ldquo;On her forehead there was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&rdquo; She is the mother of the harlots and the abominations of the earth. Babylon is not only a harlot; she is the mother of harlots, having given birth to many daughters, each one of whom also is a harlot. Thus, she is called &ldquo;the mother of the harlots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Babylon is a harlot, Jerusalem is a bride, a chaste wife. This may not seem to be an exciting doctrine, but like a compass, it points us in the right direction. The sixty-six books of the Bible speak of many things and contain many revelations. In the end, however, there are two women. The conclusion of the Bible, the last chapters of the book of Revelation, is a story of Babylon and Jerusalem&mdash;two cities and two women. We need to have a clear understanding of the principles represented by these two women so that we may serve the Lord in a proper way. This is exceedingly crucial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF BABYLON<br />
BEING DIVISION AND CONFUSION</h2>
<p>In a sense, the whole Bible is a story of Babylon and Jerusalem. One may say that the Bible is the history of the struggle between Babylon and Jerusalem. <em>Babylon</em> is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word <em>Babel,</em> which is mentioned in Genesis 11:9, and it means &ldquo;confusion.&rdquo; Hence, Babylon means confusion, and confusion means to be without regulation or governing principles. For example, the chairs in this meeting are aligned in straight rows, and this method of alignment is a governing principle. If the chairs were unevenly aligned, crookedly placed next to each other, or even overturned, it would indicate that the chairs are in a confused and unprincipled situation, a situation that reflects the principle of Babylon.</p>
<p>God created one man in the beginning, and out from this man came many men. At Babel these men formed an alliance among themselves to build a tower in rebellion and in opposition to God. Hence, God confounded their language, producing many languages. The people on the earth became divided at this point, and once there was division, there was confusion. Division is included in confusion; without division there is no confusion, and without confusion there is no division. Man spoke the same language originally and was not divided or confused until the time of Babel. Babylon represents division and confusion. In the church there are many brothers and sisters, but we are not divided or in confusion; hence, the church is not Babylon. If, however, some sisters quarrel with other sisters, and some brothers fight with other brothers to the point that they decide to no longer meet with the saints and instead set up another place of meeting, the resulting division is in the principle of Babylon. Babylon represents division and confusion.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
