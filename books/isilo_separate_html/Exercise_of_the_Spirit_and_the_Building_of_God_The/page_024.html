<h1 class="title">PRAYING IN SPIRIT AND<br />
DROPPING FORMALITIES AND REGULATIONS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:41-42; 4:23-31; 12:5, 12</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH BEING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The above verses from Acts show that the early church was a praying church. The believers did not have a fixed place or time for their meetings, nor did they adhere to any form. When they came together, they simply prayed and served the Lord in spirit.</p>
<p>In order for the church to be built up, it is necessary for every saint, especially those who bear the burden in various services, to enter into the Holy of Holies and carry out their priestly service, that is, to pray in their spirit. Only by praying in our spirit can we become living stones that are being built together. The living stones spoken of in 1 Peter 2:5 refer to regenerated believers; hence, this is a matter in the spirit.</p>
<p>The only way to be enlivened is to turn to our spirit, where the Holy of Holies is, and pray according to the sense in our spirit. Whichever part of our being that we exercise the most will become our strongest part, and its function will be manifested. In order for our spirit to be strong, it needs to be exercised.</p>
<p>We have been saved, our spirit has been enlivened, and the Spirit of God is dwelling in our spirit. These are facts. However, it is still possible for our spirit to be weak. If a brother does not live according to his spirit but instead conducts himself according to the needs of his body and his soul, his spirit will become weak. Then those who contact him will discover that he does not exercise his spirit in his dealings and conversations with others, nor does he exercise his spirit when he reads the Bible, fellowships, or prays.</p>
<p>No matter how meek or amiable such a brother might be, he cannot be built into the church. The only way to be built into the church is to learn to live in the spirit. In order to build a concrete house, we must mix cement with water and then add stones into the cement. No matter how beautiful or how smooth the stones may be, without a mixture of cement and water, there would not be a way for the stones to be joined together. Likewise, in order for the saints to be fitly joined and knit together, they must live in the spirit.</p>
<p>Concerning our being built up as a spiritual house, 1 Peter says that we are both living stones and a royal priesthood (2:5, 9). If we would be built together, we must be living stones as well as ministering priests. To be ministering priests means that we constantly exercise our spirit and live under the control and ruling of the spirit. When every saint lives in the spirit, we will be built together in spirit.</p>
<p>Every believer possesses not merely a human spirit but a mingled spirit, which is the mingling of the divine Spirit and the human spirit. Therefore, to live in spirit is to live not only in our human spirit but also in the divine Spirit. When we release our spirit in prayer, we do not merely release our human spirit; we also release the Spirit of God, who is mingled with our spirit. If all the saints were in such a spirit, we would spontaneously be coordinated, being fitly joined and knit together, and the church would be built up.</p>
<p>After we released the messages on building the church, we spent a long period of time seeking the Lord and touching His feeling concerning the practical way to build the church. The genuine way to build the church is for the saints to live in spirit and to release the spirit. The serving ones must learn to serve God in spirit. When our spirit is released, we will be blended together to become one spirit. We will also be joined and knit together in one spirit. This knitting together is not an organization in a community; it is the saints being blended as one in the mingled spirit. This blending is genuine building.</p>
<p>We hope that all the saints will be living stones that are built together and also priests who serve together by contacting God in the Holy of Holies, the mingled spirit. Only when we are in our mingled spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with our human spirit, can we be built together with other saints. There is no other way to be built together.</p>
<p>We have seen the vision, but we do not release our spirit enough; we do not spend enough time living in the Holy of Holies, within the veil. In other words, we do not spend enough time to pray in our spirit. This word is especially needed by the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones who take the lead. When we come together, we do not spend enough time to pray in spirit, our spirit is not released, and we are short of blending in spirit. Hence, we need to stress this matter. We cannot take care of the saints in a general way. As those who take the lead in the churches, we must go before the Lord and consider how much time we spend in the spirit. I am not encouraging self-analysis, which is useless. But I am asking whether our spirit is uplifted and released when we meet with the saints. We need to consider this matter seriously. If we are willing to be enlightened by the Lord, we will confess that our spirit is not strong enough.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
