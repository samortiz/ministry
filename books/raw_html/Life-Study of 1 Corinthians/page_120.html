<h2 class="head2">H. The Unbelieving Party Being Allowed to Leave<br />So That the Believing Party May Live in Peace</h2><p>In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;But if the unbelieving one separates, let him be separated; the brother or the sister is not enslaved in such cases; but God has called us in peace.&rdquo; To be not enslaved here means not under bondage, but freed from the marriage of a believer with an unbeliever, when the unbeliever leaves the believer.</p><p>According to this verse, &ldquo;God has called us in peace.&rdquo; God in His salvation has called us to Him in the sphere and element of peace. Hence, we should live in this peace. If the unbelieving party in our marriage desires to leave, we should allow it. But in order that we may live in the peace in which God has called us, God does not want us to initiate any separation as long as the other party consents to remain (v. 13). The following verses (vv. 16-24) are based upon this, that God has called us in peace. The word &ldquo;for&rdquo; at the beginning of verse 16 indicates that verses 16 through 24 are an explanation of the statement that God has called us in peace. To remain in this peace we must keep the word in verses 16 through 24.</p><p>In verse 16 Paul asks, &ldquo;For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?&rdquo; Since we do not know whether we shall save our unbelieving husband or wife, we should not insist that they remain with us, nor that they leave. God wants us to remain in the state in which He called us (vv. 20, 24), not to initiate any change. Therefore, we should leave the entire matter to the unbelieving party.</p><h2 class="head2">I. Remaining in the Status of Our Calling</h2><p>In verse 20 Paul declares, &ldquo;Each one, in the calling in which he was called, in this let him remain.&rdquo; Here we see that we should remain in the status of our calling. If we were married when called, we should remain in marriage. Likewise, if we were unmarried when called, it is better, if possible, to remain unmarried.</p><p>Verse 24 says, &ldquo;Each one, brothers, in what state he was called, in this let him remain with God.&rdquo; After being called, the believers do not need to change their outward status, but they do need to have a change in their inward condition, that is, from being without God to being with God, in order to be one with God and have God with them in their state, whatever it may be.</p><h2 class="head2">J. Seeking to Care for the Things of the Lord<br />without Other Cares</h2><p>Another principle here is to care for the things of the Lord and for the Lord&rsquo;s interests without having any other care. Verse 32 says, &ldquo;But I desire you to be without care. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.&rdquo; In verse 33 Paul points out that the one who is married cares for the things of the world and how to please his wife. As a result, he is distracted. The Greek word translated distracted literally means divided. A man who would please his wife is distracted, divided, from the things of the Lord (v. 35).</p><h2 class="head2">K. Waiting on the Lord without Distraction</h2><p>Verse 35 says, &ldquo;But I say this for your own profit, not that I may put a noose on you, but for that which is comely and waiting on the Lord without distraction.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;put a noose on&rdquo; means to entangle with a snare, to constrain to obey one&rsquo;s word. It was not Paul&rsquo;s intention to put a noose on the saints, but that they may wait on the Lord without distraction. There are distractions in married life. A married person will always have distractions.</p>
