   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Church Not Being Too Broad</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When John Wesley drafted the constitution of the Methodist Church, he wrote, Whoever wishes to escape the coming wrath can be a member of the Methodist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Please bear in mind that this is too broad.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We admit that we are behind John Wesley in many things; he was a great vessel used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are many things which we have not yet learned; we are behind him in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But there is one thing we can tell him: Brother, do you not think that this statement includes too many people?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In reality the church cannot include all those who wish to escape the coming wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even Buddhists can be counted among those who wish to escape the coming wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Oneness of Christians Including</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only God s Children</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I would like all of us to consider what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is a group of people who possess the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, Christian oneness can only be applied to God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It cannot include those who are nominal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are of the world and are not yet regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are still sinners in the eyes of God and cannot be included in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, they cannot be part of our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>C. The Matter of Procedure and Principle</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A servant of the Lord serving in a denomination once said to me, We receive all saved ones!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I said, Of course you do!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Any church should be expected to receive a saved one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But may I ask whether you reject unsaved ones?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He told me, You are smart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You can tell who is saved and who is not, but I cannot tell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I mutely agreed but said again, I am not asking if you know whether a person is saved; I am asking if you would receive someone whom you know is not saved?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not arguing about facts but about principle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My question is whether you would receive a person whom you know is not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said, Even if we know that he is not saved, I am afraid that we would still receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a church receives an unsaved person as a matter of principle, it is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not talking about facts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For instance, we are not concerned with whether or not Simon in Acts 8 was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are many people who seem to be saved when you talk with them, but who in fact are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this case there is no violation of principle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But there are some who receive everyone no matter whether or not he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This involves a matter of principle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today we are not quibbling about the procedure of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are talking about the principle behind our receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may decide to say that all descendants of Hwang-ti are Chinese; this is a matter of principle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If someone makes a mistake by including someone who is Japanese, that is an error in procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if you also decide that a Japanese person should be counted as being Chinese, you are broadening the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Throughout the ages there have always been mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We ourselves often make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We ask God for much mercy, for we have nothing to boast of in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we know the Lord s preordained principle that the church cannot open its door to receive unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, brothers, any group which openly practices the principle of receiving both the saved and the unsaved is not the church; it is the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If wheat and tares are both present, what we have is not the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the church everyone should be called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If some are called while others are not, what we have is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>D. Leaving the Organizations of Confusion</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a group opens its door widely to both believers and unbelievers, then this is not a Christian group.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Their oneness is not Christian oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One day the Lord may open one s eyes to see the need to leave this group.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If this happens, please bear in mind that he is not forsaking genuine Christian oneness by leaving the group, because there is no Christian oneness with his group; there is only confusion and mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When one leaves this kind of group, he does not leave Christian oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If there is a group which receives and mixes both believers and unbelievers, both saved and unsaved, God commands us to come out of it!</S>
