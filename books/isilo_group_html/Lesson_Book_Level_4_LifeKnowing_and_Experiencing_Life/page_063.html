NATURAL CONSTITUTION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Definition</h2><p>Dealing with the natural constitution is a deeper dealing. You may ask, &#8220;What is the natural constitution?&#8217;&#8217; [&#8220;Constitution&#8217;&#8217; as used here means &#8220;the aggregate of man&#8217;s physical and mental powers.&#8217;&#8217; In the Bible there is no such term as the natural constitution, and it is seldom mentioned among Christians; yet in our experience there is such a thing. It is an outstanding characteristic of the soulish man and a prominent expression of the living out of the old man which has to do with human ability, capability, wisdom, cleverness, schemes, and skills.]<p>Jacob, in the Old Testament, was a good example. [He was able, resourceful, full of schemes, and very capable and skillful; he was truly one who was exceedingly strong in the natural constitution.<p>Jacob&#8217;s natural constitution was expressed even before his birth. In his mother&#8217;s womb he took hold of Esau&#8217;s heel, striving to come out first. When he grew up, he cleverly schemed to gain a position of advantage. He used intrigue and cheated Esau of the birthright. Then by a clever device he obtained the blessing of the first-born from his father. When he left home, in his wanderings, God appeared to him at Bethel and promised to bless him; then also he applied his skill and bargained with God. He said, &#8220;If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father&#8217;s house in peace, and Jehovah will be my God, then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God&#8217;s house; and of all that thou shall give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee&#8217;&#8217; (Gen. 28:20-22). God had promised to bless him without any terms, nevertheless, he bargained with God on certain conditions. This only proves how smart and clever he was!<p>The reason Jacob was so scheming is that he was so strong in the natural constitution. Therefore, throughout his whole life, God especially dealt with his natural constitution. The afflictions, sufferings, and troubles which beset him were for the breaking of his natural constitution. The crisis in his life occurred when God touched the hollow of his thigh at Penuel. Finally, in Genesis 35, God asked him to go to Bethel and there make an altar unto God, who had appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother. From thence Jacob ceased all his scheming, and his natural man fell before God. All his ability, schemes, cleverness, and capability evidently disappeared and ceased. His whole being had changed completely.]<h2 class=head2>B. Dealing with the Natural Constitution</h2><p>[Flesh, self, and the natural constitution-all three-are the expressions of the old man. Therefore, the principle in dealing with them is the same: on one hand we have the objective fact, and on the other hand we need the subjective experience. The objective fact is that Christ has already crucified our old man, while the subjective experience is the applying of the death of Christ through the Holy Spirit to ourselves. If we apply it to the flesh, it is the dealing with the flesh; if we apply it to our opinion, it is the dealing with self; and if we apply it to our ability and capability, it is the dealing with the natural constitution.]<p>Do not say that you do not need to study anymore, because God wants to deal with our natural abilities. Though God does want to deal with our natural abilities, we still need to be educated and be well trained in every area of our human life. You may ask why. God wants vessels to contain Him, to express Him, to serve Him, and to build up His church together with Him. If you cannot read, how can He show you His revelation through His word? If you cannot write, you would not be able to write a gospel tract. We need to be highly educated, as high as we can attain.<p>[Acts 7:22 says, &#8220;Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.&#8217;&#8217; Under God&#8217;s sovereignty, Moses learned all the Egyptian wisdom while staying in the royal palace as the son of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter. Through his Egyptian education, he became highly cultured and received the highest learning of the world.] [Do not think that God will use your strength or energy for the fulfillment of His purpose. In order to be used by God, we need to have a heart for Him and His interests, but our natural strength must be set aside.] [God took the first forty years of Moses&#8217; life to build up a man who was strong in the natural life, and then He took another forty years to strip this man of all his natural ability.] This is the way God perfected Moses.<p>The same principle holds true for us. We need to endeavor to learn all that is useful, yet knowing that God will deal with our natural abilities and then use us. Young people should aspire to get the best grades and the highest degree, yet not hold on to nor depend on such things.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 4: Life-Knowing and Experiencing Life &nbsp; pg 63</div><br></body></html>
