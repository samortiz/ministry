   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The tabernacle typifies God incarnated to dwell among men that they may contact, receive, possess, and enter into Him to enjoy Him as their life and their life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The offerings typify the incarnated Christ who joined Himself to man to be man s substitute offering to solve all of man s problems, including sin, before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the offerings, He also becomes food to God and to those who belong to and serve God so that both God and man may be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are five basic offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition, there are subordinate offerings, such as the wave offering, the heave offering, the drink offering, the offering for thanksgiving, and the offering for a vow or a freewill offering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All these offerings are types of Christ, revealing that the riches of Christ in His various aspects meet the need of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I. THE BASIC OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The basic offerings are the basis of all the offerings; all the subordinate offerings are based on the basic offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A. The Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The burnt offering Lev 1 is mainly for God as food for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It primarily signifies Christ in His living for God and for God s satisfaction, not in His redeeming man from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the life of the Lord Jesus there was no blemish, defect, or imperfection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was perfect, and the life He lived was perfect and absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was fully qualified to be the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through His incarnation, a body was prepared for Him by God to be the real burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did God s will Heb 10:5-9 and became obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross Phil 2:8 , on which He offered Himself to God once for all Heb 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the priests offered up the sacrifice of the burnt offering to God, a satisfying fragrance, that is, a savor that brings satisfaction, peace, and rest, ascended to God for His satisfaction and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since God is satisfied, He will render His sweet acceptance to man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shows that if we desire to walk in a way that satisfies God with sweetness, peace, and rest, that is, to live a life that is absolutely for God, we must take Christ as our burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to lay our hands on Him to be identified with Him, to be one with Him, and to live the life He lived on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a life includes our willingness to be slaughtered put to death , skinned stripped of the outward expression of our virtues , cut into pieces broken, without any reservation in our entire being , and washed cleansed by the Holy Spirit .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By passing through all these processes, we will have something to offer to God as our burnt offering the very Christ whom we have experienced.</S>
