   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN RELEASING THE LORD S LIFE AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AGGRESSIVELY PREACHING THE GOSPEL A COMMISSION TO LEAD CLASSMATES TO SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As young saints, you need to receive a commission to contact and preach the gospel to your fellow students.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You do not need to preach the gospel to older people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The older saints can take care of this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, you should preach the gospel to your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You should preach the gospel to the students in your school and lead them to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not necessary to try to save many students at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is best to gain one student at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Look to the Lord and ask Him which student He wants to gain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then follow the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you feel that the Lord wants to gain a certain classmate, you should exercise your faith and contact that classmate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way, your classmates will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After a classmate is saved, you must meet with him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not depend on others; do not depend on the co-workers, the elders, the responsible ones for the district, or those in the small group; do not depend on your parents or siblings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You should depend on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You need to pray and then meet with your newly saved classmate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Help your classmate to be stirred up by the Lord, just as you have been stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then the two of you can go and contact others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way one becomes two, two become four, four become eight, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Depend on the Lord who is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This does not mean that you should not use the tools that we have, such as the literature, but that you should not rely on them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lead your classmates as new ones, and preach the word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When you speak, avoid shouting and screaming.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After speaking the word, you can lead them to pray-read and enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then go with your classmates and contact others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This way is very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every young saint who is still studying in school should contact his fellow students one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The best place to effectively contact people is your school.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First contact your classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Other students can be contacted at your convenience, but your classmates should be your target.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You must remember to earnestly pray for your classmates and for your school.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is a Catholic university with about a dozen young saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These saints should first come together at least two or three times a week for half an hour, maybe at noontime, to pray-read or fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Next, they should contact their classmates one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They should not attempt to first contact the clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, they should first contact their classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They should not merely distribute tracts or exhort their classmates to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, they should focus on one person until he has no alternative but to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They should pray for him unceasingly until he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This can be compared to digging a hole in the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You should not dig a little here and a little there, but in the end there is no hole.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If these twelve saints would each diligently work on one classmate, within a year they could gain more than fifty classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, these new ones will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They will not be fruit that dies prematurely; they will be remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THREE CRUCIAL ITEMS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>FOR THE RELEASE OF THE LORD S LIFE Not Being Ashamed of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The life in a Christian is a Lord-releasing life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a Christian does not release the Lord, the divine life will be restrained within him and will not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, we must remember that if we desire to grow in life, we must release the Lord and supply others with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we release the Lord s life, the more we will grow in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The highest way to release the Lord s life is to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we desire to contact others for the release of the Lord s life, that is, to lead others to salvation, we need to pay attention to a few items.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First, we must not be ashamed of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Satan s basic work in us is to cause us to feel ashamed of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are not ashamed to discuss Chinese classics, the world situation, science, chemistry, or mathematics with others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, when we speak to others about the Lord Jesus, we immediately feel ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all have had the experience of being ashamed when we speak with others concerning the Lord Jesus or the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Believing in the Lord Jesus should not be a matter of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why should we be ashamed when we speak to others about the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should be ashamed of stealing, lying, or provoking our parents to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, we should not be ashamed when we speak to others about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This sense of shame comes from the devil, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Romans 1:16 Paul said that he was not ashamed of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Satan wants every believer to be ashamed of speaking to people concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The young people are the best soldiers in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They must be strong in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When they feel ashamed of the gospel, they should use their strong spirit to say, Get behind me, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You will not have any ground in me; instead, I will call on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whether they are preaching the gospel to a classmate or putting on a gospel vest, they should simply say, Get behind me, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Stop troubling me.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>None of us should feel ashamed of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we are not ashamed of the gospel and of the Lord Jesus, we will overcome our weaknesses and our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are ashamed of the Lord Jesus and of the gospel, the enemy has a hold on us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, I exhort the young brothers and sisters to deal with this problem of being ashamed of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need a thorough consecration to the Lord concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When Satan comes to disturb us, we should immediately declare, Jesus is Lord! and Satan will flee.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must overcome Satan s trap.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should first deal with the feeling of shame concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The gospel is glorious, and the Lord Jesus is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>No one in the entire universe is more glorious than the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No matter how much we have achieved, if we do not overcome the feeling of shame related to the gospel, we will not be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hence, we must deal with this matter of being ashamed of the gospel until we, like Paul, can say, I am not ashamed of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Satan persistently uses this tactic to entangle us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do not think that your sense of shame related to the gospel comes from you.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This feeling comes from Satan; hence, it is a battle, and we must fight.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should always stand against any feelings of shame related to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We need a strong resolution not to be ashamed of the gospel.</S>
