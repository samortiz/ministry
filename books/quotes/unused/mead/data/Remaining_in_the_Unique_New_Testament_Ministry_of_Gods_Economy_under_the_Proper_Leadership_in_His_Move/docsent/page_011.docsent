   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>One Flow</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord has opened my eyes to realize as I have told you in the past, that in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, there is only one current flowing from the throne Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At Pentecost the current began to flow out of Jerusalem through Judea, through Samaria, and went up to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There the flow turned to Asia Minor, to eastern Europe, to Rome, and probably even to Spain, which by that time was considered as the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was only one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You cannot see two flows in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Barnabas was an excellent brother who actually brought Saul of Tarsus into his ministry Acts 11:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the beginning Barnabas took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the way of their first journey, however, the Spirit records that Paul began to take the lead, and the Spirit began to refer to Saul as Paul Acts 13:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The change of name may indicate the change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From this point on Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, took the lead in the apostolic ministry all the way, and Barnabas accepted that.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Barnabas was one with Paul to go to Jerusalem to get the solution regarding the trouble of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Right after that solution was made as a decree to all the churches, there was a contention between Barnabas and Saul Acts 15:35-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This contention was not about something great but about something small.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They did not separate from each other because of a different opinion concerning the faith or concerning the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The split between them was concerning a small, personal, intimate thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Barnabas wanted to take his cousin Mark along with him on their journey and Paul said no. To us that is a small thing, but after Barnabas left Paul with Mark there is no more record of him in the Lord s move in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reason for this is because the Lord would only care for one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I saw this matter clearly in 1933 when Brother Nee asked me to join him in the work in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time I was doing a work in north China that was quite prevailing and even promising to me in teaching the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because my eyes were opened, I told the Lord that I would go to Shanghai to join Brother Nee and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I realized that the Lord s flow, the Lord s current, on this earth has been only one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If north China were to be taken by the Lord, He would surely do it through the same flow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I had to jump into this current, to be one with this current to let the Lord flow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Leadership in the Lord s Move</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now let us consider Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is not a long record of Apollos in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was not dissenting, but he somewhat remained in another flow 1 Cor 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no hint that Apollos intended to carry on another flow, but whatever he was and whatever he did gave people a different impression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why after he worked in Corinth some could say that they were of Apollos 1 Cor 3:4 , and some were puffed up on behalf of Apollos against Paul 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Apollos was not wise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he had been wise, he would have never behaved in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By the Lord s mercy, I can declare that in those eighteen years when I was involved in the work on mainland China, I was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I never caused anyone to think that they could be puffed up on behalf of me against Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There was no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever the saints saw of me, my behavior, my way of living, my actions, the way I worked, my messages, and my speaking, they all considered to be absolutely one with Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I did not leave any loopholes for anyone to think that I was different from Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe that was the Lord s wisdom through His mercy given to me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our history since that time speaks a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among so many co-workers of Brother Nee, where is the recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I did not have any kind of thought to be the one to carry on the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even when I went to Taiwan, I was definitely sent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That was Brother Nee s proposal to the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I never had the thinking or the feeling that I was going to be the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even when I came to the United States, I did not have the thought of being the leader in the western world of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But where is the recovery today and under what kind of leadership?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some of the so-called co-workers claim that they were so close to Watchman Nee, but nearly not one church has ever been raised up by any of them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is altogether not wise for you to remain in the recovery taking this ministry on the one hand, and yet on the other hand to say something else.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not wise.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not profitable to yourself or to your future.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You may say you have a ministry, but this is not profitable to your ministry if you have one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You can never profit your ministry in the future in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, you have dispensed your future in a cheap way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The wise way is to stay, without any opinion, with the recovery which is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I want to be faithful and frank, and I want to make the situation clear to all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not believe that my being here is altogether of myself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, I believe that my being here is of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I want to see many of you rise up to be able to do the same thing that I am doing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I would never be jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I like to see this and I am for this!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Difference Between the Army</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>and the Citizens</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now you understand my standing, my heart, and where I am.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brothers, we need to be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are an army formed by His mercy and grace to fight the battle for the kingdom of the heavens!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The island of Taiwan has to be evangelized and truthized by this army within the next four years.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For the fulfilling of this purpose, I would not tolerate any kind of dissenting thought.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be a citizen of the United States is one thing, but to fight in the United States Army is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When Gideon was called to take the army to fight the battle for Jehovah, the Lord told him that he had too many Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>7:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Eventually, the Lord chose three hundred men and told Gideon to send the others home.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This does not mean that whoever went back home was no longer an Israelite.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He was still an Israelite, but he had nothing to do with the fighting army.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You may be a member of a local church and yet have nothing to do with the ministry to fight the battle for the Lord s interest on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All of you are the elders, the co-workers, and the apprentice elders, the leading ones, in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I am speaking to you all as the soldiers in the Lord s recovery, not to the citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I am speaking to the soldiers of the army.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Are you going to remain in the army?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You have to realize what the army is and what the army would do.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The army has no capacity to take your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is no time for the army to fool around.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The situation is quite urgent.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The intention of this heavenly army is to evangelize and truthize Taiwan first and then the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>One brother recently asked me if I could come to his part of the world to labor in a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>His fellowship with me gave me the feeling that he is not fighting with us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>My burden is to take Taiwan first and then the United States second.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I do not care for any particular region on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I am for the Lord s recovery and I have the view to make this strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>To my observation the best strategy is to take Taiwan first.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you are only for your part of the world this may disappoint you, but if you are for the Lord s recovery you ll say, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You may even have the burden to send some soldiers to join the army to evangelize Taiwan!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Be Wise to Acknowledge the Leader</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>in the Lord s Move</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is clear in the New Testament that Paul was taking the lead in the Lord s New Testament ministry on the earth at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When I was working with Brother Nee in mainland China, I never considered myself as anything.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I only considered myself as a co-worker to carry out Brother Nee s burden.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I did my best not to preach any gospel not preached by him and not to give any message never given by him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I did my best not to use any terminology or eloquence for the preaching, the speaking, the teaching, which he never used.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I must declare and praise the Lord that I have received the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I never regret what I did.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>No one ever heard one thing out of my mouth concerning Brother Nee in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I am still so grateful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Without him, without his ministry, I could never be here like I am.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I only labored, I only worked, and I never caused any problem to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Just before the government in mainland China was about to be changed to Communism, Brother Nee proposed an urgent conference of the leading co-workers in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He fellowshipped with us concerning how we were going to face the coming situation.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He proposed to send me out of mainland China to go abroad, and he said that he and the others would sacrifice themselves in mainland China for the s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I did not feel good about this.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It seemed to me that I was a dropout and that everyone would stay but me.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>After the meeting, Brother Nee and I took a walk, and I asked him why it was that all the brothers would stay to sacrifice themselves for the Lord s work, yet I would be asked to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I could never forget the look on Brother Nee s face when he turned to look at me.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He told me that we should be desperate and even willing to sacrifice ourselves for the Lord s move and that he realized there was much possibility that one day the enemy would wipe us out.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>He told me that in case we were wiped out, I had to go out so that we would still have something left.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Then I said that I would take his word and go.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Out of the many co-workers, I was the only one designated by him to go out in case we would be wiped out, so that we would still have something left.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Whatever Brother Nee said was all fulfilled and has become history.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Praise Him we still have something left.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We brothers must realize that we are not doing any work of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>You are not doing your work and neither am I doing my work.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We are all doing a unique work for the Lord s unique recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>There are over six hundred churches on this globe and not one is in my pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The leading ones in Anaheim can testify that I do not even know their meeting schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If I want to attend the s table I need to make a phone call to find out where I should go.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Whatever churches I have built up have all gone into others pockets.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We should realize that we are not doing a work for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We are doing a work for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Regardless of how much people have criticized Brother Nee, he was more than faithful to what he had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>He surely worked for the Lord s recovery, and he has made a good, proper, and adequate foundation for this recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>I am continuing to build up the Lord s recovery and I am doing the same work.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>I hope that all of you would be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Do not think about being somebody.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We all are nobody!</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Only Christ has a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>I do feel that my frank word should make the entire situation clear to all of you and make the need clear to all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We need a fighting army and in the fighting army we do not merely need a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>We need a commander to fight the battle!</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>We do not have any time to waste.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Many of you who have given up high degrees and high positions for the Lord s recovery have to be faithful to your sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>You also have to be faithful to so many who were influenced by you; otherwise, you are cheating them.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We must be faithful to our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We are serving Him and we mean business.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>We are not just doing a job to feed ourselves, to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>That is shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>If you want to make a living, do not stay in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Go to another and better field for you to make a better living.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>We must mean business with the Lord, with the saints, and with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>This is the only way for us to go on in the Lord s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Now you know where I am and where you should be.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Also, you know what all of us should do go to fight as an army and in the army.</S>

   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>We always behaved, acted, and took action in the recovery as one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>This is why the Lord s recovery could exist on this earth over these past approximately seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>We do not have any organization to keep anything, but the recovery is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>The recovery is still existing and has been kept by the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>While I was ministering the word, I often considered Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>I considered what he spoke; I did not like to speak anything which was contradicting with his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>If I had spoken in a contradicting way, where would the recovery be today?</S>
