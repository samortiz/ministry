[2]  Watchman Nee conducted two trainings between 1948 and 1949 for those who offered themselves to serve the Lord.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE AN INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST TERM OF THE KULING TRAINING Date:May 24 and 25, 1948
[4]  In speaking of the exercise of our senses, we are not talking about the senses in our emotion, but the senses in our spirit.
[5]  Once we realize that we serve and worship God with our spirit, we should learn not to trust in our emotion or our strength.
[6]  The spirit within us is released only to the extent that our outer man, that is, our mind, emotion, and will, is broken.
[7]  We have to learn a basic lesson from God allowing Him to break our outer man.
[8]  Let us now consider four results of the breaking of the outer man.
[9]  Only when the outer man is separated from the inner man, that is, when the spirit and the soul are separated, will a man be able to live before God.
[10]  The second result of the breaking of the outer man is that one begins to know men.
[11]  When a person comes to us, we have to know his spiritual condition; we have to know where his problem lies.
[12]  If we do not know men or their spiritual condition, we will not be able to render them any help.
[13]  How do we separate the soul from the spirit?
[14]  We do not have to do anything to separate them.
[15]  God arranges for us to experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit through our environment for the purpose of breaking us and separating our soul from our spirit.
[16]  There was not much light from God and I did not see many people.
[17]  CHAPTER FOUR THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN AND THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT 3 Date:Morning, May 27, 1948
[18]  Place:Customs Lane, Foochow The Release of the Spirit The Release of the Spirit Being
[19]  The third result of the breaking of the outer man is the ability to release one's spirit, which is the same as the ability to release the power within.
[20]  Peter said, "But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word" Acts 6:4 .
[21]  Second, the emotions of those who are broken in their outer man are subdued.
[22]  THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT 4 Date:Friday morning, May 28, 1948
[23]  Before we come to the fourth result of the breaking of the outer man, we should first ask ourselves why the outer man has to be broken before the inner man can be released.
[24]  Many people like to indulge themselves in their own whimsical thoughts.
[25]  Ready to Receive Others' Spirit Ready to Receive Help from Others
[26]  The fourth benefit from the breaking of the outer man is that it becomes easy for others' spirit to come into us.
[27]  In other words it becomes easy for one to receive help from others.
[28]  The breaking of the outer man is very much related to the way we live.
[29]  When the outer man is dealt with, we can respond to the slightest movement in others' spirit.
[30]  If the Spirit of God is moving, yet we do not touch Him even though we are in the midst of this moving, it proves that we are living in the outer man.
[31]  The breaking of our outer man is through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.
[32]  God does not intend to just break our outer man, but to separate it from the inner man.
[33]  On the one hand, God wants to break our outer man.
[34]  This is the reason God has to divide our soul from our spirit.
[35]  Verse 13 of Hebrews 4 is equally as important as verse 12.
[36]  What is the standard by which God enlightens us, exposes us, and discerns the thoughts and intentions of our heart?
[37]  CHAPTER SIX QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION 1 Date:Morning, May 29, 1948
[38]  Brother Hsie: Is the outer man broken and dealt with by God through one great blow, or is this accomplished through a gradual process?
[39]  Watchman Nee: Our outer man is broken because it is a hindrance to God's work, not because it has done something wrong.
[40]  A man may or may not know if his outer man is broken, but others surely know, just as anyone touching a saved person knows whether or not he is saved.
[41]  Brother Chen Hsi-wen: Is the breaking of the outer man the basic qualification for the ministry of life?
[42]  Watchmen Nee: Basically speaking, if a man wants to minister life to others, his outer man must be broken.
[43]  It is difficult to speak many things if the outer man is not broken.
[44]  If a worker never speaks what is within him or cannot impart to others what is within him no matter how hard he tries, this indicates that he is not yet a broken man.
[45]  Even the most outward thing of the Lord was able to heal; His power reached to the furthermost part of His whole body, and this power was diffused out through His outer man.
[46]  Through its desolation and degradation, Christianity has fallen into five kinds of groups.
[47]  It claims to be a direct descendant of the apostle Peter, and it does not admit that the church is desolate.
[48]  It is true that the Lord was mindful of the poor, but His eyes were more on dealing with the rich when He said this.
[49]  AFTER HE HAS SOLD HIS ALL Date:June 2, 1948
[50]  Third, at the time of Acts, the emphasis was on the disposal of real assets, not liquid assets.
[51]  Fifth, why should we have the saints make a list?
[52]  We do not want anyone to go to the extreme.
[53]  All the co-workers should speak the same thing concerning mammon when they set out for the work.
[54]  Second, being delivered from mammon is a part of our salvation.
[55]  We have to show the brothers and sisters, according to the New Testament, first that mammon is an idol, and second that we have been delivered from mammon.
[56]  Third, we have to learn to be rich before the Lord.
[57]  He wants us to sell our all, but He does not want us to be in poverty.
[58]  Fifth, we must uphold and maintain the practice of "He who gathered much had no excess" 2 Cor 8:15 .
[59]  After we have handed over our all, we will gain new possessions gradually.
[60]  We do not expect to gather much when we sow; we simply let go when we sow.
[61]  This is not a question of whether a man has sold his all, but a question of what a man does after he has sold his all.
[62]  Watchman Nee: Lord, we believe that nothing is too difficult for You, though to us it may be impossible.
[63]  While the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was perfect in His character but not in His power.
[64]  This is the reason it was not enough for Him to live thirty-three and a half years.
[65]  The greatest limitation on earth is death; nothing can extend beyond the confines of death.
[66]  The church is the place where God demonstrates the operation of the might of His strength, according to the power which He caused to operate in Christ.
[67]  Those who have might do not necessarily have strength, and those who have strength do not necessarily have might, but here we have "the might of His strength."
[68]  Following verses 19 and 20, verse 22 says that God has not only caused Christ to rise from the dead and to transcend all things but that He has also "subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church."
[69]  THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND THE CHURCH 2 Date:June 20, 1948
[70]  Even if a man's mind becomes more clever than it is today and even if he makes plans for himself like the rich man in the Lord's parable, whom God called "foolish," he is finished once God calls for his soul Luke 12:16-21 .
[71]  After the Lord resurrected, time and space were no longer constraints to Him.
[72]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY Date:June 19, 1948
[73]  Beginning from today we will look at the matter of authority.
[74]  Why do we need to consider the matter of authority?
[75]  First, we must know that God's acts are based upon His throne, and His throne is built on authority.
[76]  If a man has never been delivered from this satanic principle and if there is still a vestige within him of the principle which led to Satan's enmity against God, the principle which led to Satan's very rebellion, we can never serve God.
[77]  Following this we read, "For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever" v. 13c . We have to ask God to deliver us from temptation and ask Him to deliver us from Satan himself because the kingdom, the authority, and the glory are all the Lord's; they do not belong to Satan.
[78]  When we think about authority, the first thing that comes to our mind should not be the person.
[79]  We should only think of authority, not the person involved.
[80]  If we set our mind on the person before we consider submission itself, we do not know the meaning of authority.
[81]  In working for the Lord, we are God's servants.
[82]  As servants, the first thing we should touch is the authority of the Master.
[83]  Those whose eyes are set on men have never touched authority.
[84]  As ministers of God, being in line with the authority of the Head is the first principle we have to keep.
[85]  In order to serve God, we have to be confronted by His authority in a definite way.
[86]  In our relationship with God, one controversy whether or not we have touched His authority remains.
[87]  Brothers and sisters, we have to be brought to the point where we can say that there is such a thing in this universe as authority and that we have touched it and have been wounded by it, just as a man is wounded when he hits the wall with his head.
[88]  Matthew 26 tells us that the Lord suffered two kinds of judgment after His arrest.
[89]  When asked by Pilate, the Lord Jesus did not answer anything because He was not under any earthly government.
[90]  When asked by the high priest, He was initially silent, but when the high priest challenged Him by the name of the living God, saying, "I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God," He answered, "You have said rightly."
[91]  He was a person thoroughly dealt with by the Lord and was able to say a strong word to the Sanhedrin: "Men, brothers, I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this day" v. 1 . At that time Paul had difficulty with his eyes.
[92]  When those around him rebuked him, saying, "Do you revile the high priest of God?", he realized that the high priest was the chairman, and he humbled himself and said, "I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evilly of the ruler of your people'" vv.
[93]  Watchman Nee: Lord, You are God from eternity to eternity, and it is foolish for man to boast and exalt himself before You.
[94]  Today we will mention a few clear cases of lawlessness in the Old Testament.
[95]  I have a heavy burden within me to say a word to everyone here: If we aspire to serve the Lord, we all must allow the Lord to bring us to a point where we experience authority in a drastic way.
[96]  The evening before last we read Leviticus 8 concerning the sanctification of the house of Aaron for the holy priesthood.
[97]  God appointed Aaron to be the authority, and his sons were to be under his authority.
[98]  But remember, if we behave like Aaron's sons when they followed behind their father, we will bring blessing to others, and our service to God will be acceptable to Him; but if we take the initiative and shake off Aaron's authority, we will be offering strange fire, and the result will be death.
[99]  In Numbers 12 Aaron and Miriam reviled God's deputy authority.
[100]  Aaron was the eldest brother, and Miriam was the eldest sister.
[101]  Even though Moses was Aaron and Miriam's younger brother, God appointed him as the deputy authority.
[102]  Deputy authority is God's authority; it is authority given to man by God, and it is something initiated by God.
[103]  Once a man touches deputy authority, he touches God, because all authority is from God.
[104]  After God's anger burned against Miriam and Aaron, the cloud was lifted from over the tent of meeting.
[105]  Following this, Moses said, "In the morning Jehovah will make known who is His, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to Him; even him whom He will choose He will cause to come near to Him" v. 5 . He sent for Dathan and Abiram, but they said, "We will not come up.
[106]  Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also make yourself a ruler over us?
[107]  Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards.
[108]  In all spiritual matters and particularly in our service to God, the most fundamental thing is to touch authority.
[109]  Those who have only touched their fathers, sons, and brothers, but who have not touched authority, do not have a way to go on.
[110]  Ham saw his father's mistake, but he did not see that his father was his authority.
[111]  Aaron's two sons, seeing what their father had done, did the same, but they did not see that their father was the authority.
[112]  Aaron and Miriam only saw their brother's mistake; they did not touch the matter of deputy authority.
[113]  God has ordained His system of authority in the universe, and more particularly, in this world, for the purpose that this system would manifest His authority.
[114]  We must realize that every authority within this system is ordained by God and is of God.
[115]  If we trace authority in this universe to its highest source, we will find God Himself.
[116]  Although Satan fell, God did not give up the entire universe, because there were still many good and clean angels, and the universe was still under God's care.
[117]  Likewise, after Adam and Eve rebelled against God's authority and the world and mankind fell, God did not give up the world.
[118]  He still appoints authority in this world and still calls men to maintain and uphold authority.
[119]  All the institutions of authority that God has ordained in this world are involved mainly with human relationships, such as the relationships between men and women, between husband and wife, between parents and children, and between servants and masters.
[120]  From the day of creation and for the next 1,656 years, God seemingly did not appoint any authority on this earth.
[121]  God has established proper relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children, and masters and servants.
[122]  Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 11 that God is the head of Christ, and the man is the head of the woman v. 3 . Between the sexes God has established authority.
[123]  We have seen God's authority manifested in various institutions first, in human government, second, in the family, and third, in ordinary relationships.
[124]  There is a fourth place where His authority is ordained in the supernatural world, the universe.
[125]  But if our eyes are opened to this matter, we will realize that God will sacrifice anything but His authority.
[126]  Once we touch and apprehend God's authority, we will know that God created and maintains the universe by His authority.
[127]  If we cannot submit to His deputy authority, or if we say that we do not sense God's authority on earth today, we are not qualified to touch God's work; we cannot work for the Lord.
[128]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN GOD'S AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH Date: June 23, 1948
[129]  In the past few days we touched on the matter of authority.
[130]  Today we will "hit home" on this subject: God's authority in the church.
[131]  Although both the angels and man fell, God did not withdraw His authority in the universe.
[132]  God can withdraw His presence, but He will never withdraw His authority.
[133]  I would like the brothers and sisters to know one thing: Even though God has not withdrawn His authority, and even though His authority is still felt throughout the world and the universe, man daily trespasses against this authority.
[134]  God must secure a group of people who are absolutely submissive to civil authorities.
[135]  According to Romans 13:1-7, they should render tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due, fear to whom fear is due, and honor to whom honor is due.
[136]  In the family there should also be order and authority.
[137]  In order to be obedient wherever we are, we have to see that God alone is the authority and that all authorities are from God.
[138]  But once a man touches it, he feels that he has touched God because God is Spirit in Himself, but God is authority in His manifestation.
[139]  Everyone who knows God's authority has a distinctive habit: He looks for authority wherever he goes.
[140]  The first thing he asks when he goes to a place is who the authority is.
[141]  He does not say this with just his mouth; he manifests a need for submission within his very being.
[142]  Whether or not someone is good in our eyes and whether or not we approve of him, we have to thank the Lord for setting him up as an object for our submission.
[143]  If we cannot submit to him, we cannot excuse ourselves by saying that we are ignorant of authority.
[144]  When we say that we have to look for objects for submission, we do not mean that we have to look for an imperial officer to whom we should pay homage.
[145]  Today God requires that we take a strong stand under all circumstances, at all times, and in the midst of all kinds of environments.
[146]  We should obey God, and we should obey those whom He has chosen.
[147]  God needs a group of people who will submit to deputy authority.
[148]  God desires to see men who will be sensitive to His authority as soon as it is manifested.
[149]  They look for authority everywhere they go, and they submit to this authority.
[150]  What a difference it would make if we had a group of brothers and sisters who realized God's authority and who submitted to this authority!
[151]  God must have a group of people who are not only holy, righteous, and loving, but who are able to give others the impression that they have a spirit of submission, that is, that they submit to authority.
[152]  Yesterday we spoke of God's desire to manifest His authority in the church.
[153]  God can only get what He wants from the church because outside the realm of the church everything is in rebellion against God.
[154]  SUBMISSION AND OUR SPEAKING The First Manifestation of Rebellion
[155]  Today we will cover the relationship between authority and speaking.
[156]  If a man cannot be submissive in his speaking, it is vain to ask him to submit to any authority.
[157]  Following 2 Peter 2:10-11, Peter gave a very strong word: "But these, like animals without reason, born natural for capture and destruction, reviling in things of which they are ignorant, will also in their corrupting of others be destroyed" v. 12 . This is a most solemn word in the Bible.
[158]  No word of condemnation is stronger than 2 Peter 2:10-12.
[159]  Peter, however, realized that the most serious sin in the eyes of God is rebellion against authority.
[160]  If God grants many of us the leading to touch His authority for the next three to five years, we will realize the contrast between the confusions of the past and the excellence that is in the church.
[161]  Today we will speak about the ultimate expression of God's authority and where it lies.
[162]  In creating the universe God exercised His authority, and He instituted authority in the world, in human government, and in all human relationships.
[163]  God also established a kingdom and instituted His authority in this kingdom.
[164]  God desires to manifest authority through Himself, through His kingdom, and through all human relationships.
[165]  For God to manifest His authority is for Him to manifest Himself.
[166]  When God created the heavens and the earth, He also created the angels.
[167]  Angels are spirits, and they are distinct from God Himself.
[168]  Man is a soul, and he is also distinct from God Himself.
[169]  Until the age of the kingdom, man has the freedom to obey or disobey God.
[170]  There are many things which we do not have to experience ourselves; we only need to submit to those who have experienced them.
[171]  First Corinthians 12 speaks of operations, gifts, and various ministries.
[172]  Whoever has the gift has the ministry, and whoever has the ministry has the authority.
[173]  The ministry with which God commissions a person becomes his authority, and it is right for others to acknowledge this authority.
[174]  It is very hard for God to make the world, the creatures in the universe, or the Israelites obey, because they do not have a life relationship with God.
[175]  We have to see that it is difficult to practice obedience in the world or in the universe, but it is spontaneous to submit to authority in the Body.
[176]  It is hard not to submit in the Body.
[177]  Since the time of creation God has been manifesting His authority.
[178]  Only in the church, that is, in the Body of Christ, do we find a perfect relationship between submission and authority.
[179]  Unless we learn obedience in the church, we will not obey in the family or obey the government, because we will not have the proper foundation of obedience in us.
[180]  Today we will continue with the subject of God's authority in the Old Testament.
[181]  Although Saul was still on the throne, in God's eyes he was over.
[182]  This will show you more clearly the matter of submission to authority.
[183]  If we do not know authority, we will not have a way to go on in our work, our service, or even our personal walk as a Christian.
[184]  However, since God is not afraid to hand His authority to man, it means that He can put His trust in the deputy authority.
[185]  Since God dares to commit Himself to the deputy authority, we should dare to submit ourselves to the same.
[186]  God puts His trust in all the masters, parents, husbands, and men in position.
[187]  He does not say that we should submit only to the half that are good.
[188]  If that is the case, we may choose to take the other half, to whom we think we owe no submission.
[189]  Since God was at peace to use a man such as Saul, David was at peace to submit to him.
[190]  Whether or not Moses and Aaron were wrong in how they behaved is not for me to know; all I need to know is that they were God's deputy authority.
[191]  It seems as if God is saying that in order for a woman to submit to God's authority, she must first submit to His deputy authority.
[192]  We cannot say that since we have received a command from God, we will obey God only and do not need to take heed to the command of the elders or the apostles.
[193]  AND HOW IT IS RELATED TO AUTHORITY Date: Monday, June 28, 1948
[194]  Today we will speak about the relationship between the name of Jesus and authority.
[195]  It is also through this name that believers are justified, that they pray to God, and that God pours out the Holy Spirit.
[196]  We have to realize that all our authority is identified with the name of Jesus.
[197]  When the seventy disciples went out in the name of the Lord, they were able to cast out demons; the demons had to obey them.
[198]  Philippians 2:10 says that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, because God has given the Lord the highest authority.
[199]  When we apply the Lord's name, He will honor it.
[200]  If we have not seen it yet, we cannot work for the Lord.
[201]  This is the reason the Lord said in Matthew 18:18, "Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven."
[202]  The condition for knowing God's authority is submission, and the result of knowing His authority is also submission.
[203]  The more we are obedient, the more we will see God's authority.
[204]  Those who cannot submit to authority will never be chosen by God to be an authority.
[205]  He said, "For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me" v. 9 . The centurion knew that he had authority above him, that he was a man under authority.
[206]  However, we have ground to speak about authority today because God has appointed deputy authority in the church today.
[207]  If we are the deputy authority to them, we have to realize that we are not asking submission for ourselves; we are leading them to submit to God.
[208]  If we have touched only men, but not touched God's authority, we do not know authority.
[209]  A deputy authority must not try to uphold his own authority.
[210]  If you think that you can demand obedience, that your position, gift, or power justifies such a demand, you are not qualified to be an authority.
[211]  If your disposition is such that you want others to obey you, you are not qualified to be an authority; you are not the type of person who can receive submission from others.
[212]  The result of rebellion, no matter where it occurs and no matter whom it is directed against, is the overturning of God's authority, not a challenge to man's demand.
[213]  If you are challenged as a deputy authority, you have to realize that others are not offending you; there is no need for you to jump up in defense of yourself.
[214]  Except for the fact that God has placed His authority upon me, I have no desire to assume any authority of my own.
[215]  If there is any authority in us, this authority should merely lead others to obey God's authority in us; it should not demand that others obey us.
[216]  David was his authority; yet he stole men to himself to listen to his judgment.
[217]  He attracted men to himself and usurped his father's authority 2 Sam 15:1-6 .
[218]  The principle of Absalom was the principle of rebellion; he did not want to subject himself to the authority of David; he tried to establish his own authority instead.
[219]  In His prayer in the garden of Gethsemane, it appears that He was afraid to take the cup.
[220]  Yet the Lord was not set on taking the cup; He was not set on going to the cross to accomplish redemption for man.
[221]  If we have a mind that is set on obedience, God will be free to commit His authority to us just as He committed it to Christ.
[222]  Man's rebellion against authority is manifested in his speaking as well as in his reasons.
[223]  Those who do not know authority revile, and this reviling comes from reasoning.
[224]  The first time I touched something concerning authority was when I read Romans 9.
[225]  In man's eyes Jacob was naughty while Esau was honest, yet God loved the wicked Jacob and hated the honest Esau v. 13 . Paul posed the question: "Is there unrighteousness with God?", and his answer was, "Absolutely not!" v. 14 . It was as if Paul was saying, "God can do whatever He wants." If God wants to love Jacob, He can love Jacob.
[226]  The human mind may argue about God's treatment of Esau and find God unfair, yet God said to Pharaoh, "For this very thing I have raised you up, that I might show in you My power, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth" v. 17 . Was God unfair in hardening Pharaoh? We have to realize that God sits on His throne of glory, and man is under His authority.
[227]  There is another lesson which we have to learn: All those who reason with God are actually not reasoning with Him, but rebelling against Him.
[228]  This means they are rebelling and offending God's authority.
[229]  Those who remain in a low position before God have the greatest stability.
[230]  Paul, who was Saul, was an intelligent, clever, and rational person.
[231]  He was very resourceful, and he served God with his own zeal.
[232]  Once a man touches God's authority and sees His light, he does not have to suppress his words or muzzle his proposals.
[233]  It is wrong for us to think that we can tell others what to do just because we have been appointed by God to be an authority.
[234]  During the past two weeks, I have been speaking on the subject of submission.
[235]  Nothing in this world can be more beautiful than seeing a group of people who know authority.
[236]  Among those who know authority, no one makes proposals or suggestions lightly.
[237]  The Lord will be able to point to us and say, "At least I have one group of people on earth who will submit to authority."
[238]  As long as there is one church that is absolute, that obeys absolutely, and that renders a testimony of submission to God, Satan will be defeated, even if this church is small in number.
[239]  Brother Suen Lu-dian: You said that God does not want man to obey His authority while being rebellious to a deputy authority.
[240]  If someone in authority wants us to sin, we have to be submissive in attitude but we should not obey.
[241]  Whenever there is a conflict between deputy authority and direct authority, we can choose to submit to the deputy authority but not to obey him.
[242]  Question: At what point in a person's experience can we say that he has seen the matter of authority?
[243]  Watchman Nee: A man's experience of salvation relates to the amount of light he has received.
[244]  If a man receives enough light, he will feel the need for salvation.
[245]  Question: I believe that a genuine God-fearing person would not find it hard to submit to his parents or those in authority, but among the co-workers how should we choose to whom we should submit?
[246]  In a case where there are contrary opinions between two different teachers, whom should one obey?
[247]  How do we know whom to follow without an absolute outward standard of judgment of spiritual authority?
[248]  Watchman Nee: If a man has never touched authority, he cannot establish a proper relationship between submission and authority while abiding by the principle of submission.
[249]  Those who have touched authority can immediately identify the proper relationship between submission and authority.
[250]  They do not know authority, and they never touch authority.
[251]  We cannot say that we cannot find our deputy authority because God has not explicitly pointed him out to us.
[252]  Sister Wang Shu-ging: If some schools insist on cutting the girls' hair, what should we do?
[253]  Watchman Nee: The Bible does not permit believers to sue anyone cf.
[254]  If others sue us, we can respond to the suit, but we cannot initiate a lawsuit.
[255]  Those who truly possess authority never have to defend their authority.
[256]  Nine out of ten persons are prone to touch men, not God.
[257]  God may or may not have appointed one to be an authority, but it is always unsightly for a man to recommend himself as the authority.
