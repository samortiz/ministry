There are mainly four kinds of life. The first is the plant life, such as the flowering plants, the shrubs, and the trees. The second is the animal life. It is higher than the plant life, and includes such things as the insects, the livestock, the beasts, the fish, and the birds. God created all these after their kind. The third kind is the human life. It is higher than the animal life. According to the revelation of the Bible, man does not belong to the same kind as the other creatures; he is created in the image and likeness of God. Hence, as far as his life is concerned, man is of God's kind.</P><P>Genesis 1 speaks of God's creation. God created all kinds of living creatures. The lowest form is the plant life; next is the animal life. Then comes the human life. This is a high form of life, yet it is not the highest. God spent six days to create. After all the other things were created, He created man, and then He entered into rest. Hence, God worked, and man enjoyed His rest. In chapter two, we see another kind of life, which is the life of the tree of life. This is the uncreated life of God. It is a superior life and the highest kind of life. Although human life is not the highest, yet it resembles God's life, and it is after God's kind.</P><P>The Gospel of John is a book specifically on life. But it is not on the plant life, or the animal life. Neither is it on the human life. Rather, it is on God coming to be man's life. God has given us His life. When we receive Him, He enters into us and becomes our life. To us, this is the gospel and salvation. Based on this, we can say that our former concept of the preaching of the gospel was not entirely correct. We thought that to preach the gospel was to speak of the cleansing of sins, redemption, justification, and reconciliation. When a person became clear and understood these matters, then after he prayed he was saved. But after this there was still the need of a pre-baptism oral examination. If this person passed the examination, then he could be baptized, and only then could he be considered to have completed the process. Today, we are much clearer concerning the truth. We realize that the way we took was wrong. As a result, we have changed.</P><P>Consider the Samaritan woman in John chapter four. We see that the Lord did not speak to her about the cleansing of sin, redemption, or justification. He did not speak of crucifixion or resurrection. The Lord only told her that He was able to give to her the living water. The woman believed, and she recognized the Lord as the coming Messiah. She left her waterpot and went into the city, testifying to all the people. This proves that she had believed and had received. Although her knowledge of salvation was limited, she was genuinely saved. We can consider another example, that of Zaccheus' salvation. He was a chief tax collector, and he had often taken from others by false accusation. One day, the Lord came expressly to Jericho to seek after him. He told him, "Today I must stay in your house." Zaccheus gladly received Jesus. The Lord said, "Today salvation has come to this house" (Luke 19:1-10). Hence, a man is not saved through the understanding of some doctrines. Rather, man obtains God's salvation through receiving the Lord Jesus.</P><P>My subject in this chapter is the divine dispensing and the union and mingling of the Triune God with the believers. The divine dispensing refers to God's distribution of Himself into all the believers as their life. How can this be done? This is a mystery. I cannot describe it, but I know definitely that the complete God is in me. He is also in you. The same God is at the same time in all of us. Moreover, with this divine dispensing, there is the union and mingling of the Triune God with the believers. Union is outward, whereas mingling is inward. When we put on our clothing, we have a union with it. When we eat our food, we are mingled with it. We the believers have, on the one hand, put on Christ (Gal. 3:27) as our righteous garment for our covering. This is our union with Him through believing and baptism into Him. On the other hand, He is also our living water for us to drink of Him. He is also our spiritual food for us to eat Him. When we eat and drink of Him, He enters into us and is mingled with us to become our constitution and our element. Every time we break the bread, there are two symbols on the table. One is the bread as a symbol of the Lord's body, and the other is the cup as a symbol of the Lord's blood. For us to eat, drink, and receive Him is our true remembrance of Him.</P><P>Hence, the divine dispensing is simply God working Himself into all of us to be joined to us and mingled with us. The whole book of John shows us this matter clearly. God has not separated Himself from His life. Rather, He has dispensed Himself as life, righteousness, sanctification, redemption (1 Cor. 1:30), and everything to us. Whether or not we understand this matter, as long as we receive God into us, we have everything. Hence, it is not a matter of understanding, but a matter of receiving. If there are gospel friends here, all you need to do is to open up yourself, call on the Lord Jesus, and receive Him. Whether or not you understand redemption or justification is secondary. As long as you receive Him, you will gradually understand everything. Eat Him first, then talk about everything else later. This can be compared to the food that we eat every day. We do not understand all the nutrition contained in it. But when we eat all the different foods, we receive all the nutrition.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Triune God Becoming Flesh,<br>Dispensing Himself as Grace and Reality to Man</H2><P>The Gospel of John states explicitly at the beginning that "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1). This Word is none other than God Himself. He is the explanation, the expression, and the manifestation of the mysterious God. One day, this God who is the Word became flesh (John 1:14a). He entered into a virgin's womb and was conceived there. After being there for nine months according to God's law in creation, He was born as a complete man. He is the One referred to in Isaiah 9:6, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father." This child who was born is the mighty God. He is the Son, and He is also the everlasting Father. Outwardly speaking, He is a man, but inside He is God. For this reason, man calls His name Emmanuel, which means God with us (Matt. 1:23). He is God, and He is man. He is a wonderful God-man.</P><P>When this eternal God became a man through becoming flesh, He brought with Him fullness of grace and reality (John 1:14). This grace is the gift that God gave to us, which we are not worthy to receive. But it is not a matter of some outward things, which are at most material blessings. Rather, it is God Himself as our enjoyment. And the reality is simply God Himself gained by us. When God is enjoyed by us, it is grace, and when God is gained by us, it is reality. This God who is full of grace and reality is not only enjoyed by us, but is also gained by us. Without Him, there is no gain. Take Him away, and there is vanity. Hence, God desires to dispense Himself to us to be our grace and reality. This grace and reality is the very divine fullness of the Triune God spoken of in John 1:16, of which we have received, grace upon grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Triune God Dispensing<br>to Those Believing into Him<br>the Son as the Eternal Life</H2><P>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life." This eternal life is nothing other than God's beloved Son. When we believe into Him, God dispenses this Son into us, so that we receive Him as eternal life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Son Dying to Release the Divine Life<br>and to Dispense It to All the Members of His Body</H2><P>For the accomplishment of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the Son went through a further step of crucifixion on the cross. He voluntarily offered Himself to accomplish an all-inclusive death, not only to deal with sin, the old man, Satan, the world, the old creation, and all the negative things, but to release the divine life, as the one grain of wheat falling into the ground, and to dispense it into all the members of His Body (John 12:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Son Resurrecting to Become the Spirit,<br>as the Ultimate Consummation of the Triune God,<br>Dispensing the Triune God into the Believers</H2><P>Three days after the Son died, He resurrected. In His resurrection, He was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit. The same evening, Jesus came into the midst of the disciples and appeared to them. He greeted them and breathed a breath into them. In this way, they received the Holy Spirit (John 20:8-9, 19, 22). This Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God attained through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, by which the Triune God is dispensed into the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORGANIC UNION OF THE DISPENSING TRIUNE GOD<br>AND THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The Triune God passed through all the processes to become ultimately the life-giving Spirit to be dispensed into all the believers. Through this, the dispensing Triune God is organically joined to all the believers. This union is like the union between the branches of a vine with the vine tree (John 15:5a). The branches of a vine and the tree share the same life and live the same living. The two abide mutually in one another as the result of the life-union (John 15:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORGANIC MINGLING<br>OF THE LIFE-DISPENSING GOD<br>WITH THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity results in not only an organic union, but an organic mingling. When we believe into Christ and are regenerated, we receive God's Spirit of life. This Spirit begat in our spirit the pneumatic Christ, so that the Triune God is organically mingled with the regenerated believers (John 3:3-6). By this, the divine attributes of the Triune God&#151;God's love, Christ's grace, and the Spirit's fellowship&#151;are with us (2 Cor. 13:14). Love is the source, grace is the expression, and fellowship is the reaching to us. God's love is simply God Himself as the source of the grace of the Lord. The fellowship of the Spirit is simply the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God dispensed into us for our participation and enjoyment. These are not three separate things, but three aspects of one thing. This is God in His trinity dispensing Himself into the believers.</P><P>Now, God has accomplished this divine dispensing. What glad tidings these are! All things are ready. We can now come to the feast (Luke 14:17) to breathe God in and to eat and drink of God, that is, to breathe in the pneumatic Christ as air, that Christ may be mingled in breath with us for our existence (John 20:22), and to drink of the pneumatic Christ as the living water, that Christ may be mingled organically with us in our living (John 4:10, 14; 7:37-38), and to eat of Christ as our spiritual food in the living word of life, that Christ may be mingled organically with us in life-element (John 6:48, 57b-58a). Hence, whatever we have breathed, drunk, and eaten into us become ours. Not only is it joined to us, but it is mingled with us. In this way, all that God is and has, becomes ours. We have God's life and nature. We also have justification, sanctification, and redemption, together with all the human virtues, such as patience, humility, and obedience.</P><P>As long as we would continually breathe Him in and eat and drink of Him day by day, we will spontaneously grow in the bountiful supply of Christ as the true vine, and we will be bountifully supplied organically in the matter of fruit-bearing (John 15:1, 4-5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RESULT OF THE BELIEVERS' ENJOYMENT<br>AND APPLICATION OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</H2><P>When we enjoy and apply the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, and we are joined outwardly and mingled inwardly with Christ, the following results will be produced: (1) out of us will flow rivers of living water (John 7:37-39); (2) we will bear fruits of life (John 15:1, 4-5); (3) we will be able to feed the lambs in the flock (John 21:15; 10:16); (4) we will become the bride of Christ, His counterpart. This bride as the Body of Christ is His ultimate increase (John 3:6b, 29-30); and (5) we will become the organism of the processed Triune God, which as the universal vine tree in John 15 (vv. 1, 5, 8) becomes the concrete, corporate, and great manifestation of the Triune God.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on October 19, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br>AND THE INCREASE OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 3:31, 34-35, 3-5; 1:12-13; Heb. 2:11-12; Rom. 12:5; John 3:22-30; 10:10b-11, 14-16; Acts 20:28; John 12:24; 15:1, 5, 8, 16a</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The immeasurableness of Christ&#151;John 3:31, 34-35:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Christ coming from above and being above all&#151;v. 31.</li>	<li>The Father having given all into His hand&#151;v. 35.</li>	<li>Christ being sent by God, speaking the words of God&#151;v. 34a.</li>	<li>Christ giving the Spirit&#151;His divine dispensing&#151;not by measure&#151;v. 34b.</li>	</ol></li><li>The divine dispensing of Christ becoming His divine increase:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Christ regenerating the believers to produce the children of God as the brothers of Christ, becoming the members of His Body and constituted to be His Body&#151;John 3:3-5; 1:12-13; Heb. 2:11-12; Rom. 12:5.</li>	<li>The regenerated ones constituted as the bride of Christ, to be His counterpart, becoming His increase&#151;John 3:3-5, 22-30.</li>	<li>Those receiving the life of Christ becoming His sheep enjoying Him as the pasture to become His flock, which is the church&#151;John 10:10b-11, 14-16; Acts 20:28.</li>	<li>Those having the resurrection life of Christ becoming the grains produced through His dispensing to be the bread, which is His Body&#151;John 12:24.</li>	<li>The believers who are joined to Christ and who are His branches dispensing Him to others, making them the fruit, to be the organism of the processed Triune God, having Him as the definite expression&#151;John 15:1, 5, 8, 16a.</li>	</ol></li><li>The definite steps to dispense this Christ to others:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Every morning being revived, taking two or three verses as spiritual food to enjoy Christ.</li>	<li>Every day overcoming, taking the word we have thoroughly enjoyed as the supporting strength.</li>	<li>Continually contacting our acquaintances for the dispensing of Christ, transfusing Christ into them, and inviting them and leading them to attend the group meetings.</li>	<li>Toward the end of the group meetings, preaching the gospel to them one by one, leading them to believe in Christ, to call on His name, and to be baptized.</li>	<li>After baptism, conducting a lesson with them on the way of life, teaching them to call on the Lord all the time with their spirit.</li>	<li>Making appointments with them to have morning revival together over the telephone, and asking them to begin reading one chapter of the Bible before they go to bed, beginning from that very evening.</li>	<li>Visiting them once every three or four days, supplying life to them and leading them on.</li>	</ol></li></ol><P>The subject of this message is the divine dispensing and the increase of Christ. In simple terms, the divine dispensing is God working Himself into us. The result of this is the increase of Christ. The first part of John 3 speaks of regeneration, which is the divine dispensing, and the second part concerns the regenerated ones, who have the life of God, becoming the bride of Christ as His increase.</P><P>Today, the church as the bride of Christ is the increase of Christ, in the same way that Eve as the counterpart of Adam was the increase of Adam. Just as Eve came out of Adam and belonged to Adam, the two becoming one, resulting in the increase of Adam; in the same way the church came out of Christ, being joined to Christ, becoming one spirit with Him, resulting in her being the increase of Christ.</P><P>In the first message, we have seen the accomplishment of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The whole Gospel of John tells us how the Word, who was God and who was there in the beginning, became flesh to experience the human living and was crucified and resurrected to become ultimately the holy Breath, which is the life-giving Spirit breathed into the believers. The God who was there in the beginning has become very near to us. He is so near that He is even in us. He has been processed and has accomplished His divine dispensing, being organically joined to us and mingled with us, making us the bride of Christ, which is His Body, His ultimate increase.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE IMMEASURABLENESS OF CHRIST</H2><P>John 3:31-36 reveals to us that Christ is unlimited and immeasurable. Such an unlimited and immeasurable One came from above and is above all, being transcendent above everything. Moreover, the Father has given all into His hand. He is sent from God, speaking God's word. He gives the Spirit without measure. The giving of His Spirit is His divine dispensing, and the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. We can say that a table is the ultimate consummation of many individual pieces of wood. In the same way, the Triune God in eternity has been processed to ultimately become the Spirit, who as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God is dispensed into us, the believers.</P><P>This divine dispensing of God is a matter in life. We know that everything that has to do with life is not peculiar, but is very normal. For us to have God inside of us does not necessarily mean that we will have some unusual feelings. When a person has God, he simply has Him. But when he has a problem with God, immediately he will feel wrong within. This shows that God is indeed within him. Since God's dispensing, which is His giving to us of the Spirit, is without measure, we should fellowship with Him in a faithful way, and we should allow the Lord to fill us with His Spirit. In this way, He Himself will be dispensed into us in a rich way. This is not the so-called filling of the Holy Spirit known in the Pentecostal movement, which is claimed to produce strange feelings and peculiar occurrences. Rather, this is a genuine receiving of God's dispensing and an enjoyment of God Himself.</P><P>Every day we should have this kind of filling of the Spirit and this kind of dispensing from God. We have to know that for everything there is the need of time. Today, the Triune God has accomplished His divine dispensing. But on our part, there is still a step we need to take to receive His dispensing, which is to spend time to come to Him and to contact Him. For this reason, every day we need a definite time to fellowship with the Lord, to experience His presence, to receive Him within, and to be filled by Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF CHRIST<br>BECOMING HIS DIVINE INCREASE</H2><P>The result of this enjoyment of the divine dispensing of Christ is that we become His divine increase. This can be seen from five aspects. First, through regeneration we are produced to be the children of God and the brothers of Christ, becoming the members of His Body and constituted to be His Body (John 3:3-5; 1:12-13; Heb. 2:11-12; Rom. 12:5). This Body is the fullness of Christ, which also is His increase. Second, the regenerated ones are constituted to become the bride of Christ as His counterpart to be His increase (John 3:3-5, 22-30). God has regenerated us by His Spirit, so that we have His eternal life. Furthermore, He has filled us with His immeasurable Spirit, so that we can become the bride of the all-inclusive Christ who is above all and can become His divine increase.</P><P>Third, as those who have received the life of Christ, we have become His sheep, enjoying Him as the pasture and becoming His flock, which is the church (John 10:10b-11, 14-16; Acts 20:28). The Lord forsook His soul life to accomplish redemption for His sheep, so that we can partake of God's life and by it be brought into one flock to be the increase of Christ. Fourth, the ones who have received the resurrection life of Christ, as the grains produced through His dispensing, become the bread, which is His Body (John 12:24). The Lord is the one divine grain. Through His death and resurrection, He released the divine life to produce many grains as His increase for the expression of His glory. Fifth, the believers who are joined to Christ and who are His branches dispense Him to others, making them the fruit, the organism of the processed Triune God, having Him as the definite expression (John 15:1, 5, 8, 16a). To bear fruit is to dispense to others the Christ that we have received, so that they would become the branches of the Lord as the true vine and would become the increase of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DEFINITE STEPS IN DISPENSING<br>THIS CHRIST TO OTHERS</H2><P>We are all branches of the Lord, and we have been sent forth by Him to bear fruit. As such we should dispense Christ to others. Here we have listed seven definite steps:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Every Morning Being Revived,<br>Taking Two or Three Verses<br>as Spiritual Food to Enjoy Christ</H2><P>In order to dispense Christ to others, the first thing to do is to be revived every morning. We should get up early every morning, and before we do anything else, we should spend ten to twenty minutes to pray-read two or three verses from a selected book of the Bible. We should read and pray, and we should turn what we read into prayer. In this way, we will mingle the Lord with His word and will receive Him into us. By this, we will enjoy the Christ in the word as our spiritual food.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Every Day Overcoming,<br>Taking the Word We Have Thoroughly Enjoyed<br>as the Supporting Strength</H2><P>As long as we are definitely revived this way, every day we will have two or three verses in us. Even if we cannot memorize them, it is still good if we can copy them on a piece of paper and carry it around with us. We can go over them again and again for our instant supply. When we have these two or three verses for our supporting strength, we can live an overcoming life every day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Contacting Our Acquaintances,<br>Transfusing Christ into Them,<br>and Inviting and Leading Them<br>to Attend the Group Meetings</H2><P>If we are revived every morning, overcoming every day, and have the Lord Himself as our supply and our supporting strength, as far as we ourselves are concerned, this is quite sufficient. But we must not forget that we also have to dispense Christ to others. Every one of us has some people that we know, including our relatives, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates. Among them, we can find at least twenty who are not yet saved. We need to write down their names and give a copy of this list to the church and keep another copy for ourselves. We should then pray continually for them and should contact them, transfusing Christ into them. All of us should do this, beginning from our own "Jerusalem" (cf. Acts 1:8). There is no need to knock on "cold" doors; these "warm" doors are enough for us. At the same time, we can seek for fellowship; we should coordinate with others to preach the gospel to our own acquaintances or those of the brothers and sisters, and we should invite and lead them to attend the group meetings.</P><P>For this reason, from now on we should prepare a list of our gospel friends, on the one hand, and establish group meetings, on the other hand. The group meeting is the foundation of our church life. Eighty percent of the church life is contained in the group meeting. In addition to attending the Lord's Day morning meeting, every one of us should attend a group meeting. The number at a group meeting should not be too many or too few. Preferably it should be around twenty. The elders and co-workers should train the brothers and sisters in the group meeting to preach the gospel. In every group meeting, we expect the brothers and sisters to bring their acquaintances along. They should try their best to invite and even to lead them to attend these meetings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Toward the Close of the Group Meeting,<br>Preaching the Gospel to Them One by One,<br>Leading Them to Believe in Christ,<br>to Call on His Name, and to Be Baptized</H2><P>Our group meetings have to be living, and they should never be in the way of a worship service. We all should testify and should fellowship with one another. We should not tell stories. Instead, we should speak simply of our experience of the Lord. If new ones or gospel friends come into our midst and listen and observe what we are doing, they will be quite interested and impressed. About half an hour before the close of the group meeting, we can take the gospel friends aside and preach the gospel to them individually. We should preach to them with the booklet "The Mystery of Human Life" which we have ready with us, and we should open our mouth, exercise our faith, and preach by looking at the new ones with our eyes. We should exercise the authority that the Lord has given us and should lead them to believe in Christ, to call on His name, and to be baptized. In this way, they will be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. After Baptism, Conducting a Lesson<br>with Them on the Way of Life,<br>Teaching Them to Call on the Lord<br>All the Time with Their Spirit</H2><P>After the new ones are baptized and have changed their clothes, we should conduct a lesson with them on the way of life. It does not have to be long. The main thing is to tell them that our Savior is living in us today; we can call on His name all the time to contact Him and to enjoy Him. After this, we should exercise to demonstrate to them a little how we do it, and we should ask them to do the same to show us whether they have learned it. We must do this, and we must not be lax in doing it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>6. Making Appointments with Them to Have<br>Morning Revival Together over the Telephone,<br>and Asking Them to Begin Reading<br>One Chapter of the Bible Before They Go to Bed,<br>Beginning That Very Evening</H2><P>In addition to calling on the name of the Lord, we should tell them that we, the Christians, not only have to pray, but must read the Bible as well. For this reason, we need to teach them how to pray-read the Lord's word. After this, we should start having a morning revival time with them the next morning. We should ask them to get up fifteen minutes earlier than usual and make an appointment to have morning revival with them over the telephone. In addition, we should ask them to start reading a chapter of the New Testament every night before they go to bed, starting from that very same evening. We can ask them to start from the book of Romans or from 1 Corinthians. This will not only assure them of having a good sleep, but will give them much long-term benefit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>7. Visiting Them Once Every Three or Four Days,<br>Supplying Life to Them and Leading Them On</H2><P>On the one hand, we should have morning revival over the telephone every day, and on the other hand, once every three or four days, we should visit them. During the first month after baptism, we should visit them seven or eight times and should fellowship with them face to face, supplying life to them and leading them on step by step.</P><P>What I have fellowshipped with you has been tested and tried to quite an extent. It is definitely a workable way. Not only should we all receive it, but we should practice it accordingly. If we do this we will not be disappointed, but will reap at least a thirty percent increase. This is marvelous! May the Lord bless all of you.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on October 20, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPER REVELATION<br>CONCERNING THE COMING OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Dan. 9:24-27;

Although the age is dark, we have Your word as a lamp that shines in a dark place. We are gathered together before Your word. We believe that You are with us here. Release Yourself through Your word. Shine on us with Your light. O Lord Jesus, we really look to You. At this end time, this crucial time, may You open our eyes and gain our hearts so that we would be open to You and to Your desire. May You enlighten us, speak to us, that we would be fully enlightened and would have the morning star rise in our hearts.</P><P>Lord, You know that the age is dark and that it is not easy for us to overcome its tide while living in it. O Lord, we look to You. We are here not only pursuing some biblical knowledge, but are here pursuing Yourself. Your word is Your embodiment. We desire to gain You through Your word. We are not here to listen to some so-called prophecies in a curious way. Rather, we are here seeking after You. May You open Yourself to us and dispense Yourself to us, so that every one of us may gain You from Your word once again. Lord, we confess our weakness and poverty. It is You who give life. For this reason, we look to Your blessing. Cleanse us with Your blood that we would please You and would receive Your anointing. May You speak in our speaking, and while we speak, may You truly be one spirit with us. Prove to us that You are here with us. Lord, bind the enemy for us. Rebuke the evil one. We hide under Your blood. Cover us, and oppose for us anything that opposes us. Amen.</P><P>In this message I will share with you the proper revelation concerning the coming of Christ. I do not have much commission from the Lord to mention the prophecies in the Bible. But concerning this matter I have studied much for exactly sixty-five years, from the day that I was saved until now. What I have touched are all writings by some of the better scholars. These scholars not only were familiar with biblical history, but they also were very well acquainted with the types in the Bible. Their interpretation of prophecy is both fundamental and accurate. From them we have received the best help. Hence, my understanding of biblical prophecy has been gained fully by standing upon their shoulders and by further development of what they have seen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SEVENTY WEEKS APPORTIONED OUT BY GOD</H2><P>In order to understand the prophecy concerning the coming of Christ, we must go back to the book of Daniel in the Old Testament. In Daniel's time, the children of Israel were in captivity in Babylon. Later, Babylon was taken over by Persia. Cyrus, the king of Persia, was one who feared God and did things according to His will. In the first year of his reign, King Cyrus made a decree to the whole nation that the Israelites were to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple of God (Ezra 1:1-4). Even before Cyrus became king, and as the time of the Israelites' captivity was approaching seventy years, Jehovah sent His messenger and spoke to Daniel: "Seventy weeks are apportioned out for your people and for your holy city, to close transgression, to make an end of sins, to make propitiation for iniquity, to bring in the righteousness of the ages, to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the most holy place" (Dan. 9:24).</P><P>These seventy weeks are divided into three sections. The first section consists of seven weeks, from the decree put forth for the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the completion of the building, a total of forty-nine years. At that time, Jerusalem would be rebuilt with street and moat (Dan. 9:25). The second section consists of sixty-two weeks, from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the cutting off of the Messiah, who is Christ, a total of four hundred thirty-four years. After that, the people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary, and the end of it will be with a flood, and even to the end there will be war; the desolations are determined (Dan. 9:26). In this way, the first section plus the second section equals sixty-nine weeks.</P><P>From the end of the sixty-nine weeks, the seventy weeks are interrupted. This continues for a long time until the coming of the last week. During this interval, God has set the Israelites aside and has chosen another group to be His people. This group is the church. Hence, this period is called the age of the church, or the age of grace, or the age of mystery. Generally speaking, this period began from the first coming of Christ and will continue to the second coming of Christ. The two comings of Christ become the beginning and the end of this age of mystery. During this age of mystery, everything that God does is a mystery. For example, the Lord's incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, becoming the Spirit, and entering into the believers are all mysteries. Furthermore, redemption, forgiveness, and regeneration, also are mysteries. Not only Christ is a mystery; even all of us are mysteries. Although we have not seen Christ, we love Him and are willing to pay the price to pursue Him. One day we will be changed in form. All these are mysteries hidden from the ages. When the seventh trumpet blows, that is, at the end of this age, all these mysteries will be fulfilled, completed, and will come to pass (Rev. 10:7). By that time everything will become open and manifest.</P><P>At the end of all these matters, the last week will come. It will begin at the time when Antichrist makes a seven-year covenant with the nation of Israel. In the middle of the seven years, Antichrist will break the covenant and will cause the oblation and sacrifices offered to God by the Israelites to cease, and will set up his image of abomination in the temple to replace God. Then he will persecute for three and a half years all those who worship and serve God, until Christ comes to earth to destroy him and to cast him into the lake of fire (Dan. 9:27; Matt. 24:15; 2 Thes. 2:8; Rev. 19:19-20). The end of the second half of that week will be the end of this age (Matt. 28:20). From this we see that the last week is the key to all the prophecies, and Antichrist will be the chief character in that week.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANTICHRIST</H2><P>Revelation 13:1 points out that the beast, a symbol of Antichrist, will come out of the Mediterranean Sea. Revelation 17:8 tells us that Antichrist will come out of the abyss. This means that Antichrist will come out of two sources. Before he is born, his spirit will already be in the abyss, and it will come out of the abyss. His body will come out of one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea. Based on this, we know that those who claimed in the past that Napoleon was Antichrist, or later, that Mussolini or Hitler was Antichrist, and those who claim now that Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq, is Antichrist, are wrong.</P><P>Revelation 17:7-12 explains the mystery of the beast. Antichrist will be the Caesar of the revived Roman Empire and will be ranked with the previous Roman Caesars as the seventh Caesar (Rev. 17:10). When he comes, he will be slain temporarily, and the spirit of the fifth Caesar (Nero) of the Roman Empire will come out of the abyss and will enter into his dead body, resurrecting him to make him the eighth Caesar (Rev. 13:3, 18; 17:8, 10-11). He will be revealed before the appearing of Christ, and will exalt himself above all that is called God, even seating himself in the temple of God, proclaiming himself that he is God (2 Thes. 2:1a, 3-4). Furthermore, before the great tribulation comes, ten kings will be raised up within the revived Roman Empire, who will be joined to Antichrist to oppose God and to persecute the people of God, that is, the Jews and the Christians (Rev. 17:12-13). Antichrist will trample underfoot the holy city Jerusalem, and will persecute the believers for forty-two months, that is, for three and a half years (Rev. 11:2; 13:5-7; 12:14). This is the great tribulation mentioned in the Bible.</P><P>By this we can see that the ancient Roman Empire must be restored, and the temple in Jerusalem must be rebuilt. We know that at present there is a Common Market in Europe. Its condition closely resembles the revival of the Roman Empire. In addition, during the past year all the satellite nations of the Soviet Union have given up Communism one after another to practice democratic reforms. This also will help the general development of Europe into a unified entity. Consider again the nation of Israel. After having been broken up for twenty-five hundred years, it was revived as a nation in 1948. Later, it even recovered its capital. Based on reliable sources, we know that the Israelites are actively making preparations for the rebuilding of the temple. All the materials needed for the building of the temple, and all the utensils used for offering sacrifices, have been prepared according to the Old Testament.</P><P>A few months ago, Iraq invaded Kuwait; this led to the military intervention of the United States. The combined forces of the United Nations' member nations also have positioned themselves in Saudi Arabia. The two sides are having a standoff, and the situation between them is tense. This upset the order in the Arab world and brought in diverse opinions. The whole situation has turned to the advantage of Israel. The good land that God promised to Israel in the beginning extends from the river Euphrates on the east to the great sea (the Mediterranean) on the west. On the north it stretches to Mount Lebanon, and on the south it extends to the river of Egypt. This vast expanse of land has never been fully occupied by the Israelites. Hence, the development of the Mideast situation focuses mainly on who the future owner of the good land will be. Will it be the Arabs, or will it be Israel? According to biblical prophecy, the nation of Israel will become strong and will eventually be fully restored.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GREAT TRIBULATION</H2><P>The great tribulation will be a time of unprecedented and unsurpassed calamities (Matt. 24:21). It will last for three and a half years, during the second half of the last week, and is the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try those who dwell on the earth (Rev. 3:10). According to the record of Revelation, the great tribulation will begin from the sixth seal with the supernatural calamities (Rev. 6:12-17), and will pass through all the woes of the first through the seventh trumpets (Rev. 8:7&#151;9:21; 11:14-18), ending with the woes of the first through the seventh bowls (Rev. 16:1-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMING OF CHRIST</H2><P>The coming of Christ is His presence (parousia in Greek). It will last for a period of time. First, it will begin from heaven at the start of the three and a half years of the great tribulation. At that time, the man-child will be raptured to the presence of Christ at the throne of God in heaven (Rev. 12:5), and the firstfruits will be raptured to the presence of Christ at the heavenly Zion (Rev. 14:1-4). Furthermore, all the other living overcomers will be raptured to the presence of Christ in the air to stand before Him (Matt. 24:40-41; Luke 21:36; Rev. 3:10), enjoying His presence and being delivered from the great tribulation. The other living saints will remain on earth to pass through the great tribulation. During this time, God will nourish them (Rev. 12:6).</P><P>Second, toward the end of the great tribulation, the coming of Christ will remain in the air. After the great tribulation, the majority of the believers, those who will have been resurrected and whose bodies will have been transfigured, will be raptured to the presence of Christ in the air (Rev. 14:14; 1 Thes. 4:17). This includes the ten resurrected virgins (Matt. 25:1-12) and the two witnesses, who will be resurrected to be raptured (Rev. 11:11-12). At that time, all the saints, including those who are raptured to heaven before the great tribulation and who will come later with Christ to the air, will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ for reward or punishment (2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 11:18b). After this, Christ will marry the overcomers. They will be invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb and will become the bride of Christ (Rev. 19:7-9).</P><P>Third, at the completion of the great tribulation, the coming of Christ will descend from the air to the earth. After the marriage dinner of the Lamb, Christ, with the overcomers whom He marries as His army, will fight against Antichrist and the kings and armies under him at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16). At that time, the armies of Antichrist will gather together to fight to destroy the nation of Israel. Christ will come there to tread the winepress of the fury of God (Rev. 14:19). The blood will come up to the bridles of the horses (Rev. 14:20). In this way, His garment will be dipped in blood (Rev. 19:13). On the one hand, Christ will bring Antichrist to nothing by the appearing of His coming (2 Thes. 2:8). On the other hand, He will appear to the Israelites like lightning, and the whole house of Israel will be saved (Matt. 24:27, 30; Rev. 1:7; Rom. 11:26-27; Zech. 12:10-14). After this, Christ will send His angel to bind Satan and throw him into the abyss (Rev. 20:1-3). In this way, the kingdom will be brought to earth (Rev. 11:15; 12:10a). Christ will sit on His throne of glory and will judge the nations that are still alive, separating the people as "sheep" and "goats." The "sheep," those who obey the eternal gospel and who treat the suffering believers well, will be blessed. They will be reckoned righteous and will inherit the kingdom. The "goats," those who do not obey, will be cursed and will perish eternally (Matt. 25:31-46; Acts 10:42b; 2 Tim. 4:1). In addition, Christ will restore the kingdom of Israel (Acts 1:6; Matt. 19:28) and will bring in the restoration of all things (Acts 3:21).</P><P>Today, not only are our ears blessed to be able to hear this gospel, but also our eyes are blessed to be able to see the fulfillment of all these prophecies. Sixty-five years ago I began to study the biblical prophecies. In 1948 I saw with my own eyes the restoring of the nation of Israel. In 1967 I saw again with my own eyes the return of Jerusalem to the nation of Israel. Today, when we consider the world situation and the distribution of the peoples on this earth, we realize that everything is developing in the direction predicted by the prophecies in the Bible. I believe that not long from now, all the things will be fulfilled.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on October 19, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BELIEVERS' PROPER ATTITUDE<br>TOWARD THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 4:8; Phil. 3:20; 1 Thes. 1:10; Rev. 22:20; 2 Pet. 1:19; Matt. 24:32-33, 42-44; 25:13; Luke 21:34-36; Rev. 3:10; Matt. 25:4, 10; 24:45-51; 25:19-30; 1 Cor. 3:10-17; Rev. 16:15</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Loving His appearing&#151;2 Tim. 4:8.</li><li>Earnestly awaiting His return&#151;Phil. 3:20; 1 Thes. 1:10.</li><li>Calling for His return&#151;Rev. 22:20.</li><li>Giving heed to the prophetic word as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in our hearts&#151;2 Pet. 1:19.</li><li>Giving heed to the fig tree, signifying the nation of Israel: seeing her branches become tender (the reestablishing of the nation of Israel) and put forth leaves (Israel's regaining of the capital, and other such events), and knowing that the summer (the restoration of the nation of Israel) is near&#151;Matt. 24:32-33.</li><li>Being watchful and being ready&#151;Matt. 24:42-44; 25:13.</li><li>Taking heed to ourselves lest at some time our hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that day come upon us suddenly as a snare; for it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth&#151;Luke 21:34-35.</li><li>Being watchful, at every time beseeching, that we may prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man, that is, to be raptured to the presence of Christ in heaven&#151;Luke 21:36</li><li>Keeping the word of the Lord's endurance, and being kept out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try those who dwell on the earth&#151;Rev. 3:10.</li><li>Being the prudent virgins with our souls, that is, our entire being, filled and saturated with the Spirit of God, lest we be shut outside of the marriage feast of Christ&#151;Matt. 25:4, 10.</li><li>Being a faithful and prudent slave, taking care of the Lord's church by giving food to the saints at the appointed time, that is, according to the gifts received, fully exercising our function lest we lose our reward and receive punishment&#151;Matt. 24:45-51; 25:19-30.</li><li>Being careful how we build the church on the foundation laid by the apostles, lest our building be consumed, bringing loss to ourselves so as through fire&#151;1 Cor. 3:10-17.</li><li>Being watchful to keep our garments, lest we walk naked&#151;Rev. 16:15.</li></ol><P>From the teaching of the New Testament, we can see that when the apostles, including Paul, were writing the New Testament, they thought that the Lord Jesus would come back in their lifetime. The prophets in the Old Testament, in foretelling the coming of Christ, thought that He would have only one coming. But actually, there are two comings of Christ. Moreover, these two comings are separated by at least two thousand years. This is like two peaks of a mountain. When looking from afar, they seem to be joined together, one stacked in front of the other. When we read these prophecies now, we know that the Lord's coming is at two times. Moreover, the second coming of Christ will not be as soon as the apostles thought.</P><P>Some may wonder why the Lord's return is not yet fulfilled now that the two thousand years have nearly passed. Did not the Lord say at the end of the Bible, at the conclusion of Revelation 22, that He would come quickly? We should not forget that to the Lord, a thousand years are as one day (2 Pet. 3:8). To the eternal Lord God, time is not a factor. In fulfilling the promise of His return, what is important is not time, but the facts. Today, as I stand before you, I can say with assurance that the time of waiting will not be very long, because from the various prophecies of the Bible, and in comparing these prophecies with the present world situation, we can see that the Lord's coming is near.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LOVING HIS APPEARING</H2><P>My burden is this: when the apostles wrote the New Testament, to them the Lord was coming soon. Hence, the teaching of the New Testament shows us that their living was in preparation for the Lord's return. This is like the situation in which some long-separated relatives are soon to return. The entire family is prepared to welcome them. It is also like a girl waiting to be married, who knows of the wedding day and who is waiting wholeheartedly for that day to arrive. Paul was one who had such an attitude. The life he lived was a life of waiting for the Lord's return. We can see this by reading 1 Thessalonians. That book has five chapters. Each chapter concludes with the Lord's coming back. From this we can see that Paul was one who loved the Lord's appearing (2 Tim. 4:8). We also should be this way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EARNESTLY AWAITING HIS RETURN</H2><P>Since we love the Lord's appearing, we should earnestly wait for His coming (Phil. 3:20; 1 Thes. 1:10). Hence, our future is with Him. Our living should indicate that we have no other hope on this earth. Our hope is in the coming Lord. He is our eternal destiny. In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul says, "But this I say, brothers, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none, and those who weep as not weeping, and those who rejoice as not rejoicing, and those who buy as not possessing, and those who use the world as not using it to the full; for the fashion of this world is passing away" (vv. 29-31). Christ is our real hope.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CALLING FOR HIS COMING</H2><P>We may express our desire for the Lord's return in the way of a prayer to Him, calling, "Come, Lord Jesus!" (Rev. 22:20). We should always call for His coming. This becomes our response to His return.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GIVING HEED TO THE PROPHETIC WORD<br>UNTIL THE DAY DAWNS</H2><P>Second Peter 1:19 says, "And we have the prophetic word made more firm, to which you do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts." The prophetic words in the Scriptures are like a lamp to the believers, transmitting spiritual light to shine in our darkness, guiding us into the bright day and leading us even through the dark night to the day of the Lord's appearing, that is, the time of the dawning of the day. Before the Lord as the shining of the sun appears, we need the light of His word to enlighten our footsteps.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GIVING HEED TO THE FIG TREE<br>THAT TYPIFIES THE NATION OF ISRAEL</H2><P>The Lord's coming has much to do with the nation of Israel. Matthew 24:32 tells us that when we see the branch of the fig tree becoming tender and putting forth its leaves, we know that the summer is near. The fig tree signifies the nation of Israel. After being cursed (Matt. 21:19), it was reestablished in 1948. Later, the capital was recovered. That was the branch becoming tender and putting forth leaves. Therefore, the summer, signifying the restoration of the nation of Israel, is already near. When we see the temple rebuilt and Antichrist appearing, we will know more assuredly that the nation of Israel will quickly be restored (Matt. 24:33).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING WATCHFUL AND BEING READY</H2><P>Matthew 24:42 says, "Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes." When the Lord comes, He will come secretly as a thief to those who love Him, and will take them away as a treasure (Matt. 24:43). Therefore, we must be watchful (Matt. 25:13) and must be ready (Matt. 24:44).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TAKING HEED TO OURSELVES LEST OUR HEARTS<br>BE WEIGHED DOWN WITH DISSIPATION<br>AND DRUNKENNESS AND ANXIETIES OF LIFE</H2><P>Luke 21:34-35 says, "And take heed to yourselves lest at some time your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare; for it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth." Today, many people pursue earthly riches and love the modern fashion of this world. This is a form of dissipation. They are swallowed up by these things like one who is drunk or in a dream. Their hearts are weighed down by the anxieties of life, and they have no way to be rescued from them. We need to take heed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEEDING TO BE WATCHFUL, BESEECHING<br>AT EVERY TIME THAT WE MAY PREVAIL</H2><P>In order for us to escape the coming tribulation, we need to be not only watchful but also beseeching. Luke 21:36 says, "But be watchful, at every time beseeching, that you may prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man." Our strength and power to escape the great tribulation come from being watchful and beseeching. For this we need to be revived every morning and overcoming every day, so that we can be raptured before the great tribulation to the Zion in heaven to stand before our Savior (cf. Rev. 12:5-6, 14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KEEPING THE WORD OF THE LORD'S ENDURANCE,<br>AND BEING KEPT OUT OF THE HOUR OF TRIAL</H2><P>We also need to keep the word of the Lord's endurance. In Revelation 3:10 the Lord says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth." Today the Lord's word to us is the word of His endurance. If we want to keep the word of His endurance, we must suffer the rejection and persecution that He suffered. By this we will be preserved and kept from the great tribulation, which will come upon the whole inhabited earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING A PRUDENT VIRGIN</H2><P>Matthew 25 shows us how the prudent virgins watchfully await the bridegroom's return (vv. 1-10). They carry their lamps with oil in their vessels to go forth to meet the bridegroom. They are the prepared ones. When the bridegroom comes, they can go in with him to the marriage feast. We believers are like chaste virgins. In this dark age we are testifying for the Lord, and we are going out of the world to meet the Lord. For this, we need not only the indwelling of the Spirit of God, but also the filling and the saturation of our soul, that is, of our entire being, by the Spirit of God, lest we be shut outside the door of the marriage feast.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING A FAITHFUL AND PRUDENT SLAVE</H2><P>On the one hand, we need to be the Lord's prudent virgins. On the other hand, we need to be the Lord's faithful and prudent slaves. Virgins signify the aspect of life; we are espoused to the Lord and are living to Him. Slaves signify the aspect of service; we are purchased by the Lord to serve Him. Matthew 24 and 25 also tell us of the way to be a faithful and prudent slave: to take care of the Lord's church by distributing food to the believers at the appointed time, and to do our best to function according to the gift we have received, lest we lose our reward and receive punishment instead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING CAREFUL HOW ONE BUILDS THE CHURCH<br>UPON THE FOUNDATION LAID BY THE APOSTLES</H2><P>First Corinthians 3:10-17 tells us that we should be careful how we build the church upon the foundation laid by the apostles. We should not use the materials of our natural man, which are wood, grass, and stubble. Instead, we should build upon Christ as the unique foundation with all the attributes and virtues of the Triune God, which are gold, silver, and precious stones, lest our building be consumed and we ourselves suffer loss so as through fire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING WATCHFUL TO KEEP OUR GARMENTS</H2><P>Finally, we need to be watchful to keep our garments. In Revelation 16:15 the Lord said, "Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments, that he may not walk naked and they see his shame." We need to keep ourselves in honor, not walking according to the flesh but according to the spirit, so that we may be prepared to meet the Lord.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on October 20, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>DISTINCTIVE VIRTUES OF AN ELDER&#151;<br>LABORING, BEING DILIGENT,<br>STRIVING, STRUGGLING</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Tim. 2:6; Rom. 12:11; Matt. 25:26; Phil. 1:27; Col. 1:28-29</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Laboring&#151;1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Tim. 2:6.</li><li>Being Diligent&#151;Rom. 12:11; Matt. 25:26.</li><li>Striving&#151;Phil. 1:27.</li><li>Struggling&#151;Col. 1:28-29.</li></ol><P>Prayer: Lord, we humble ourselves before You. We confess our weaknesses, corruption, defilement, and failures. We need Your forgiveness in many ways. We need the cleansing of Your blood. Lord, cleanse us from the inside to the outside, from top to bottom. We need You, and we need the anointing of Your ointment to anoint us in a rich way. Even more, we need Your presence and Your speaking to us here. We are here listening quietly to Your speaking. Lord, speak to us. When You speak, we are enlightened, supplied, and rebuked. We present ourselves naked before Your light. Shine on us that we may know You and may know ourselves in Your light. O Lord Jesus, may the vision that Isaiah saw that day be seen by us today. We want to see our Lord seated high on the throne of glory. Lord, send us, and give us Your command. Speak to us also words of love that would touch our depths. The more we are touched by You, the more we will bow before You and will vow to You to offer ourselves completely to You. Lord, lead us on step by step. During these two meetings, speak to us point by point the words in Your heart, that is, the words that You want us to practice and to follow. Be sympathetic toward our slowness. Lord, we need Your support moment by moment. Bring us into Your light and into Your feeling. Lord, we worship You, and we offer up our praise and thanksgiving to You again. Amen.</P><P>Thank the Lord that we can have this meeting again. This is due to the Lord's sovereign arrangement. We know that from October 1984, we began to speak of the "new way" here. That was exactly six years ago. During these six years we have passed through quite a process. At the beginning, the response was mute. Later, there was some progress. After this, there was the opposition, and finally, the attack. Up to the present, the great majority of the churches on the earth have accepted the Lord's leading joyfully and are willing to take this God-ordained way.</P><P>The first thing I would like to mention to the brothers and sisters is that in this God-ordained way, on the one hand, I myself have been learning, and on the other hand, I have been leading others. At the same time, I have made many observations. If anyone has ever placed a question mark on this way, I have been the first one. On the one hand, I have been studying and learning. On the other hand, I have also adopted a skeptical attitude. I tried to find out if this way can stand the test of the biblical measure and standard. Today I can tell you that the answer I have received is yes, and that this way is fully according to the Bible. I have studied the Bible for sixty-five and a half years. I have studied many topics. I can say that this is the only topic in which all the contents are positive and nothing is negative. Moreover, every point contained in it is according to the Bible.</P><P>Moreover, I have found out at least three things that have not been practiced by the Lord's church on earth for the last two thousand years, which can be put into practice point by point in the new way. It is true that because of our weakness, our slowness, and our evil heart of unbelief, we have not been strong, intense, fresh, and clear enough in our practice; yet as far as the practices themselves are concerned, these three points, which the Lord has never seen carried out by the saints except at the time of the apostles, are all being carried out through the new way. The first point is the prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14. There it says, "Whenever you come together, each one has..." (v. 26). "If therefore the whole church comes together in one place...if all prophesy..." (vv. 23-24). Again, "For you can all prophesy one by one" (v. 31). This point is now being put into practice. According to my observation, whether in America or in Taiwan, this practice has obviously succeeded, though not in full, at least in part. This is an undeniable fact.</P><P>The second point is in Ephesians 4. There it says that the Head, Christ, has given to the church gifts such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. These people do not build up the Body of Christ directly. Rather, they perfect the saints that the latter may do the work of the New Testament ministry (vv. 11-12). This matter has never been properly carried out by anyone in the practice of the church. But at this time we are carrying it out. I cannot say that we are completely successful, but I have definitely seen the success. This also is an undeniable fact.</P><P>The third point is covered in Romans 15:16. There it says that everyone is a priest of God's gospel, offering repentant sinners as sacrifices to God. Here in Taiwan we do not see big gospel campaigns, yet hundreds and thousands are saved. This is an amazing thing.</P><P>Today on the whole earth, although the Lord's recovery has encountered many weaknesses and shortcomings, it has reached all six continents. The Lord's recovery has gone to North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australasia. Moreover, I have the definite assurance that the churches in all the continents welcome the new way. In spite of this, the day of glory has not yet come. This is the burden in my heart. In these two meetings you will not receive many great doctrines. What we need now is to labor, to be diligent, to strive, and to struggle. In 1984 I came back to carry out the new way. Taiwan can be considered the first place that responded to this. Although we were a little slow in the beginning, later we picked up this way. After the three years of 1985, 1986, and 1987, the big meeting on Sunday morning was still practiced in Taipei. It was in October 1987, after we had the gospel festival in Taipei, that we said goodbye to the meeting in which one man speaks. This is very good. Yet not long after that, everyone became relaxed again.</P><P>In the process of our studying, I have found out that the God-ordained way in the Bible is that man must labor. This is like a farmer farming in his field. If he does not labor even for one day, the effect will be evident. A saying among the northern Chinese is, "The grains are dropping!" This means that when the grains are ripe, one must hurry and harvest them in the field, even if he has important engagements at home. Once the time is past, the grains will all fall to the ground. Hence, the farmers not only need to labor, but they must also labor on time if they expect to see a good harvest.</P><P>All of you sitting here are either elders, co-workers, or full-timers. I would like to ask whether you are laboring like a farmer. The reason I say that our condition is not yet up to the standard is that we are not laboring enough. Moreover, the God-ordained way is not that a few would labor; rather, it is that every one of us would labor. Because our laboring is not sufficient, the result of our work is not very apparent. When I saw this situation, I went back to the Bible and considered what it says. I discovered that in the Old Testament, not much is mentioned concerning laboring and diligence. Only Proverbs speaks about these things a little. It says that the sluggard sleeps and slumbers, and his poverty comes quickly (6:9-11). It also says that the sluggard will not plow because of the cold; therefore, he will beg during the harvest and have nothing (20:4). The New Testament says more concerning this matter. For example, the book of Romans is a book on Christian living and the church life. There it says that we should not be slothful in zeal, but burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave (12:11).</P><P>We do have a problem in serving the Lord, and this problem is slothfulness. Perhaps some would say, "Brother Lee, we are not slothful. Every week we come regularly to the meetings. How can you say that we are slothful?" Today I must tell you that if you have only scheduled meetings, you will never be successful. You must add to this, diligence. According to my observation, the way that we have now is correct and according to the truth. The saints have no objection or dissension toward it. Everyone receives it gladly. But we seldom see any response outside the regular meetings. This says one thing: that in their service, the brothers and sisters are not lacking in regular labor; but there is no exceptional labor. However, the secret to success lies in the exceptional labor.</P><P>In addition to diligence, Paul used some very strong words in describing his service to the Lord. He said that he was laboring, striving, contending, and struggling. If I remember correctly, these words are borrowed from the ancient Olympic games. In the arena, whether one engages in running, wrestling, high jumping, or any other sport, everything can be summed up in these words. Everyone gives himself to strive. Paul said, "I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me" (1 Cor. 15:10). Furthermore, he said, "For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power" (Col. 1:29). At that time Paul was facing opposition from three directions: from Judaism, from the Gnostics, and from the heathen traditions. All of these opposing things were very strong. However, he was not at all subdued. On the contrary, he labored and struggled all the more.</P><P>Today, it is as if we have received the new way in a sedan chair. According to my observation, among us there are only very few who are laboring and struggling. Whenever there is a slight frustration, many retreat. But what we should do is either give up or do it thoroughly and consistently. According to my observation, all who are successful are given to their work. I know of an old sister who is over eighty years of age. She flung everything aside and gave herself to the work. In the end she saw a result. We have to know that in God's creation there is a natural law: those who are not diligent cannot expect to have success. The most obvious example is seen in the farmer's farming. God created the heavens and the earth, and He sends rain and sunshine and has given us the air. But the farmer must still till the ground diligently before he will have a harvest. In the practice of the new way, we must labor like a farmer before we will see a result.</P><P>Many places have received the new way joyfully. Yet when they put it into practice, they return to the old way. For example, when they knock on doors, they still tremble while standing at the door. When they open their mouth, they still tell "sea stories." Matthew 28 shows us that in His resurrection, the Lord returned to the disciples and said to them, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (vv. 18-19). Hence, all we need to do is to say Amen to the Lord's word and go according to this word. We do not need to tremble, for we are the full representatives from heaven. When we go, we should tell others, "Jesus Christ has sent me to you to tell you to believe in Him." If they say that they do not know how to believe, you can lead them to pray, "Lord Jesus, I believe in You." After you have prayed with them word by word, you can tell them, "You have believed, and you have prayed. Now I will baptize you." This is to exercise the Lord's authority to baptize people into the Triune God. In the universe, from God's point of view, such a person is already saved. The poison of Christianity is in their attempt to make those to whom they preach clearly understand salvation before baptizing them. But the word of the Lord says that we should go and should disciple all nations, baptizing them into the Triune God. Only after doing this should we teach them of what the Lord has commanded us (Matt. 28:20).</P><P>Do we believe that it is time that saves men, or the Holy Spirit who saves men? The Lord Jesus said, "Go...baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." With that word we go. This is the word of the Lord Jesus Christ. Will He not honor His word? In Romans 10:8, Paul quoted the word of the law in Deuteronomy 30:14. He said that that word is the word of the faith. This word is Christ. It is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart. Brothers and sisters, we need such a view. Even the word of the law is the breath of God and contains God's life.</P><P>We should believe that when we go out to visit people and to preach the gospel, the Spirit operates in every word of ours. Therefore, we should simply tell others, "Jesus Christ has sent me here to tell you that you must believe in Him. This is not my word, but the word of Jesus Christ. He is in your mouth and even in your heart." You must believe that your word is the word of Christ. The difference between the new way and the old is that in the old way we try to speak of Christ without having Christ, whereas in the new way we have Christ, and we minister Christ to others.</P><P>I have no intention to boast concerning my age, but I have had much experience, so that I am convinced that it is not time that saves man. It is not "sea stories" that will dispense life into man. Rather, it is the Spirit of God planting the word out of God's mouth into man that gives man life. Hence, the new way is a way of faith. It is a way by the Spirit. Do you want to preach the gospel? If so, you must have faith; otherwise, you should not go. You must believe that you are an ambassador of the Lord and that the Lord has sent you. As long as you will go, others will listen to your word.</P><P>Brothers, it is not enough to welcome and to receive the new way. It requires us to give ourselves to it and to follow it closely. We should do exactly as the Lord has said. When you preach the gospel and bring others to salvation, these become your children. From your heart, you must consider them as newborn babes, and you should do your best to care for them, to nourish them, and to lead them on gradually. Some have said that they have understood everything concerning the new way. But according to my observation, such persons have never entered into the new way. Although they do not oppose the new way, their heart is not there; they are still working according to the old way. The principle that governs the way we do things in the world is the same as that which governs the way we do the work of God. If you hire a worker to work for you, and his heart is not in the work, and he is not of the same mind as you are, willing to sweat and give his life to the work, it is better for you not to hire such a one. You must believe my words. Even a band of robbers must be in one accord and give their life to their work. In the United States there are a few brothers in business who are renowned marketing managers. They asked me, "Brother Lee, from whom have you learned? The way you preach the gospel is exactly the same as the way we teach others to sell." I have not learned from anyone. I have learned from the Bible.</P><P>I would advise all of you here, whether you are an elder, a co-worker, or a full-timer, that if you want to take the new way today, you must give yourselves to it. You must risk all for this. Otherwise, it is better for you not to take this way. When I came back in 1984 to take the lead to practice the new way, I was risking all. At that time I had served the Lord for over fifty years. I cannot claim to have accomplished very much, but I must say that I have done something. I took the risk to come back to Taiwan for this work, and I have encountered much opposition and attack. Yet I have been at ease. Nothing can deter me or frustrate me. I have given my all. No matter how people slandered me or opposed me, I was not shaken. I advise you that if you want to take the new way, you must give yourselves to it in this way.</P><P>I must remind you of another thing: never bring in the way you learned to serve the Lord in the past. That would make you one who takes the new way, but with the old method. If you want to take the new way, you must go all the way. If you do not understand something, you must study and learn. It is worthwhile even to fast and lose sleep because of this. This past Lord's Day I went to one meeting hall for a meeting. I looked into the situation there, and I found out that every one of the saints there was produced by this way of giving oneself to the work. During the past two or three years, every year they have realized a one hundred percent increase. I heard their testimonies. Every one of them was sincere and genuine. My point is that you cannot practice the new way with the old way anymore. You must learn to start from the most basic step, and you must pick up the points one by one.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I cannot say that I am very experienced in the Lord's work. But by the Lord's mercy, I always know what I should say at any given time. I believe the subject I have chosen for today, "Distinctive Virtues of an Elder," is the need in Taiwan today. Some of you have been serving the Lord here for decades. You think that you know everything. But where is the result? Do not be offended by me; this is my word of exhortation in love. You have not seen any result in the new way because you have not given yourself to it. I advise you not to dabble any longer. Otherwise, you will spoil others as well as yourself. If you do it, give yourself to do it. If you are not for it, simply reject it. I am not being rude to you; I am merely trying to stir you up a little.</P><P>Dear ones, I hope that you will receive my sober words. May the Lord be merciful to us. By the grace of God, may we rise up to take the new way, learning step by step and going on step by step. Take, for example, the matter of preaching the gospel. Actually, we do not need to knock on "cold" doors; there are many "warm" doors. Every brother or sister has at least twenty gospel friends, either their unsaved relatives, their friends, or their neighbors. We do not have to take care of them all by ourselves. We can coordinate together. Some relatives have heard our preaching for years and are still not saved. This may change if someone else preaches to them. Some may get saved in just this kind of way. In nourishing the new ones after they are saved, we should not use the old methods. We must learn to be new. In the past, we have been affected too much by tradition and natural concepts. We have not followed the Spirit very much. The proper way for us to help people is not to solve their problems, but to lead them to call, "O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!" That is all that is needed. As long as a person touches the Lord and enjoys Him, all his problems will be solved. We must believe that the Lord in whom we believe is real and living. For this reason, we should not work according to our old methods anymore. That way is not effective. We must practice strictly according to the new way.</P><P>This is the reason we must strive, struggle, and wrestle. Strictly speaking, we cannot consider ourselves as having accomplished anything yet. We are still in the process of learning. We must learn diligently and in a desperate way. Please believe my word: anyone who is willing to give himself to learn will become an expert in the new way. Ability comes from learning. I believe all of you are for the new way. But it is not enough just to be for the new way; we must all be diligent, laboring, striving, and struggling to give ourselves to practice the new way.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DEFINITE STEPS<br>TO PRACTICE THE NEW WAY</H1><P>In this meeting I will speak in detail concerning the way to practice the new way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRAYING FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</H2><P>First of all you need to do two things. You need to emphatically make an announcement to the church in your locality and beg the brothers and sisters to pray for the practice of the new way. You need to pray specifically for this matter in the prayer meeting of the church. If the Lord so leads you, you may declare a fast with prayer for that day. That would be the best thing to do. You should also ask the brothers and sisters to pray privately and daily for the practice of the new way. They should pray not only for one or two months, but for a long time, perhaps for at least a year, and see how the Lord will hear their prayers. You know, and I truly believe, that the prayer of the church is particularly effective. This is not a small matter. You must do this. Although the practice of the new way requires human labor and striving, we still need to trust in prayer. What the Lord wants us to do can only be accomplished by Himself. He cannot do it without us, but even if He has us, we still need to pray to cooperate with Him. Personally, I feel that in the Lord's work, regardless of what we do, if prayer is overlooked, there will be a great lack. Therefore, we need to pray in everything. The more prayer there is, the more we will see the Lord work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEARING FRUIT FOR THE LORD</H2><P>Second, you need to explain to the brothers and sisters and even beg them to realize that the first step of this new way that the Lord is leading us to take is to bear fruit for the Lord. If we do not bear fruit, we will offend the Lord, and we will owe the Lord something because He has sent us to go to preach the gospel (Matt. 28:19) and has also appointed us to bear fruit (John 15:16). We need to bear at least one fruit a year. If we cannot do even this, it will be hard for us to give an account to Him. For this reason, you need to speak clearly to the brothers and sisters that they all have to pick up this burden to preach the gospel to save sinners. It does not matter whether or not one takes the new way; as long as he is pursuing the Lord, he must bear fruit. Here in Taiwan, where we are, there are people everywhere. It is as if fish were jumping at our feet, yet we still ignore them. We do not need to go to the sea to catch fish; the "fish" are already before us. If we still would not stretch forth our hands to save others, we will really have no words with which to defend ourselves.</P><P>Moreover, it is to our loss if we do not bear fruit. One day we will all have to stand before the judgment seat of Christ. Matthew 25 clearly shows us that every saved person has received gifts from God, some more and some less, and that they should exercise these gifts to make more profit for the Lord. When He comes back, we all must go before Him to give an account. If we have not borne fruit and have not brought people to the Lord, we will be condemned by Him as slothful and evil slaves and will lose the kingdom reward (Matt. 25:14-19, 24-30). Therefore, from this time on, every brother and sister needs to receive grace to bear fruit for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO BEAR FRUIT</H2><P>Regarding the way to bear fruit, everyone first needs to make a list of all their unsaved relatives, friends, colleagues, classmates, or neighbors. You should keep one copy for yourself and should give one copy to the church. When you write down the names, you must do it in a clear way. The list should include one's name, relationship, age, address, and telephone number. Second, have all those who are willing to set aside three hours a week for the definite preaching of the gospel sign their names. If there are some who cannot do this due to their poor health or lack of time, yet are burdened to pray, they can also submit their names, together with the time and frequency for which they have committed themselves to pray. In this way, you will know and will have a record of the number and condition of those who will go out to preach the gospel and of those who will pray at home.</P><P>Third, you should check occasionally with those who have submitted their names to be the praying ones for the practice of the new way. You may do this once every three months or once a month. During the group meetings or after the Lord's table meeting, you may ask them to give some testimonies in order to remind them. This can be done very easily. Those for whom the greater effort is required are the ones who have submitted their names for going out to preach the gospel every week. As elders you yourselves must first learn how to go out to visit people and bring them to the Lord. Only after you have learned this can you gather others together and train and teach them to do the same. Then, according to the practical situation, you may divide them into groups. Every elder must personally take the lead in a group. At the beginning, you need to demonstrate everything to them. This is to deliver them from their natural way and to put their trust in the way we have discovered through our study. After a while, you can let them work by themselves while you take oversight over them.</P><P>Furthermore, in training others, you need to have definite principles concerning every point. You must not be vague, but must be clear and definite. You should not speak things which leave others bewildered, but should apply the exact medicine needed for the sickness. When we go out to preach the gospel, we do not need to socialize or to try to compliment people. We need only to exercise the Lord's authority and act according to the Lord's command, bringing people to believe, to be baptized, and to be saved (Mark 16:16). You have to believe that whatever we do in the Lord's name will count. We are the ambassadors of Christ and are here to preach the gospel of peace, bringing people into subjection to Christ and to a reconciliation with God. While our attitude needs to be meek, our words need to be definite and strong. In short, we all need to be trained in God's New Testament economy and in God's ordained way. In addition, we need to teach and perfect others to speak for God and to lead people to salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FEEDING THE LAMBS</H2><P>After you have baptized people and have brought them to salvation, the next thing you need to do is feed them. In order to do this well, you need to be persons full of concern for people. You need to be interested in others and be concerned for their condition. When you bring a person to salvation, the joy it gives you is the same as if you yourselves were being saved, and this person becomes your child begotten through the gospel. You should never teach him by human methods. Instead, you need to feed him by the Spirit of God. When he rises up from baptism, you have to provide him with a lesson, helping him to know that he has a spirit, that he is now regenerated, that God is Spirit, and that this Spirit is His ultimate consummation. Now He is everywhere, even in his mouth and in his heart. As long as he calls on the name of the Lord, he will touch God within, and will enjoy God's presence. This is the real feeding. Such feeding should be done as frequently as possible.</P><P>If a person is baptized today, you can start to have a morning revival with him tomorrow. The best way is by telephone. It is a convenient and time-saving way. You can make an appointment with him and should pick out an appropriate time in the morning to pray-read the Lord's word with him over the phone. This should last for about ten minutes. Through this, he will touch the Lord and will enjoy the Lord. It is not good to read too much each time because he cannot digest it all. It is best to use only two or three verses. You should simply digest the Lord's word through prayer. There is no need for too much explanation. Occasionally, you may explain a little. In addition to this, you must help him to take these two or three verses and allow them to rise up in him over and over throughout his whole day, whether at work or at home, and to pray over them for his supply. Besides this, you can also feed him at other times on the telephone. In this way, you will have more contact and conversation with him and will be able to give him appropriate suggestions and definite leadings. In this way, before long you will see him growing in the Lord and being changed. Day by day he will not only be able to eat well, but will also learn much. This will produce some very great results.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ESTABLISHING GROUP MEETINGS</H2><P>If every one of us preaches the gospel according to the new way, bringing people to salvation and feeding the lambs, in a few months we will be able to gain two or three persons. A few of us can then bring our lambs together to form a group and establish a group meeting. First, in the group meeting we should not try to conduct worship services. Second, we should not try to meet. Third, we should not sing, pray, or read the Bible in the same way we used to do. When we come together, we should simply be normal. However, we should not be common. Rather, we should be full of praise and thanksgiving within. Spontaneously, there will be the mutual care, the mutual intercession, the mutual shepherding, and the mutual help. You need to take care of all these things in every group meeting. At a certain point, everyone will be very clear how many brothers and sisters there are in the group and what the condition of their family is. Everyone needs to learn to fellowship whenever anything happens and to let everyone else know about it. In this way, the group will have a foundation, and much will develop out of this.</P><P>This is why we say that the small groups comprise the major portion of the church life. If a local church is to be strong, the number of people attending the groups must be high. It is better that the number of people attending the group meetings exceed the number attending the Lord's Day meeting. If this is the case, our church life will not merely be worship services, but a practical church life. Besides the mutual care, feeding, mutual acquaintance, and intercession, another main function of the group meeting is the perfecting. It is best to spend half of the time to do this work. How do we perfect? We do not have appointed teachers or designated leaders. Everyone is a student as well as a teacher. Anyone can ask questions and anyone can answer questions. Some may answer in a shallow way, and some may answer in a deeper way. It is very good, of course, if an answer is correct, but if an answer is incorrect, it does not matter. There will always be some who can wisely make an adjustment. Eventually, all the answers added together will become a very good and complete message. Unconsciously, the attendants will learn the truths. Week after week they will spontaneously obtain nurturing and perfecting.</P><P>If you will work on the groups according to what I have told you, I can guarantee you that bit by bit, like a little stream that flows steadily, our number will double every year. You will continuously have new ones added to you. Generation after generation, everyone will be nourished and perfected. In this way, we will truly be the refined and educated ones. I believe that in a few years such a situation will be seen among us.</P><P>According to the revelation in the New Testament, the practice of the new way sometimes requires the help of the apostles and teachers. They conduct conferences and trainings in the church. We can see this in Paul. He conducted a long-term training in Ephesus, admonishing and teaching people for two to three years (Acts 19:8-10; 20:31). After this, he went to Troas, where he stayed for seven days and held a special conference (Acts 20:6-12). For this reason, from 1986 until now we have had full-time trainings. In addition to this, it would be to the further advantage of a big church like the church in Taipei to have conferences once a month to release timely messages, "blow the trumpet," and motivate the whole church to go forward. All these cannot be accomplished by the small meetings and are also needed.</P><P>When I returned this time, I felt happier than the last time because, according to my observation, all the local churches here have made progress. Therefore, I wanted once again to review with you the way to preach the gospel, to feed the lambs, and to have the group meetings. What I have fellowshipped with you is sufficient for you to take back to practice. I would ask that after you go back to your locality, you would fully carry this out step by step. You should not try to practice it in a general way; that will not work. You must definitely take the lead to do it, and you must make sure that the brothers and sisters are doing it. In this way, you will have a bright future ahead of you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TWO LESSONS</H2><P>In addition, I hope that you all can learn two lessons. In whatever you do, you have to look to the Lord from deep within, saying, "Lord, I am merely a channel and a vessel. Without You, whatever I do is empty. Without Your blessing, whatever I do will come to nothing." We need to have this kind of spirit and should pray this way all the time. There is another important lesson which we must not forget: regardless of which church, hall, or district we are in, we are all one Body. Therefore, we must keep the oneness of the Spirit and must be in harmony one with another, loving one another, learning from one another, and helping one another. We should not think that we are doing well and despise others. Neither should we be jealous because others are doing better. All these things should not be within us. If possible, we should go to one another to observe and to learn. Do your best to learn whatever can be learned. Do your best to teach others in whatever way you can help them. Even the people in the world have such an exchange all the time. We should have this all the more.</P><P>You must also understand that regardless of how careful you are and how much you love one another, no two persons will conduct their work exactly alike. For this reason, you need to avoid opinions, criticisms, and confrontations. You need only to do your best to learn and to do your best to work. You do not need to wait three to five years. I believe by this time next year you will have much improvement. In one year you can make much progress. May the Lord be merciful to you.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BEING TRAINED<br>IN THE DIVINE REVELATION</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:16-17; Col. 1:25-26; Rev. 22:18-19; Luke 24:45; Heb. 5:13-14; Psalm 119:130; Acts 8:30-31</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The sixty-six books of the Bible being the complete revelation of God which cannot be added to or subtracted from&#151;2 Tim. 3:16-17; Col. 1:25-26; Rev. 22:18-19.</li><li>In order to understand the Bible, we must exercise our spirit, have our mind opened, and have our faculties exercised&#151;Luke 24:45; Heb. 5:13-14.</li><li>The Bible needs to be opened (entered) in order to give forth its light&#151;Psa. 119:130; Acts 8:30-31.

The primary goals of this training are to perfect a group of young believers to go down to the villages to preach the gospel, to come back to the big cities to learn to serve, and to build up the church. At the same time, we also have the intention that some would go overseas to spread the Lord's recovery, especially in Latin America and Africa. We know that one third of the total population of the world speaks Spanish, and that all of Latin America is under the influence of the Roman Catholic Church. Most of the other parts of the world use English as the principle language and are primarily under the influence of the Protestant churches. But both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches are far away from the Bible in their form, expression, and content. Most of these churches have become deformed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE</H2><P>In the 1920s, the Bible came into our hands. We received the Bible, not something by word of mouth. This was not a small thing. Moreover, as we consider the riches of theology through the past centuries, we can see that in the first period, before the birth of Christ, these riches were in the Hebrew language. In the second period, after the birth of Christ, they moved from the Hebrew language to the Greek language. Then in the third period, from about 1590 to today, they passed through the Latin language and entered into the English language. Today the riches of all the theological studies throughout the centuries can now be found among the English-speaking world. Beginning from 1920 with Brother Watchman Nee, we have had brothers among us who have read, investigated, and dived into these riches.</P><P>I would take this opportunity to briefly let you know about the process by which the Bible was translated into Chinese. In 1807, a British missionary named Robert Morrison came to China. He began to translate the Bible, and published his translation by 1823. From that time there began to be different translations carried out and completed by various scholars. Some were translated into the classical Chinese style, and some were in the modern language. Then in 1919, the Chinese Union Version was officially published. It was later revised and came to be called the Mandarin Union Version. This was based on an English translation, the 1885 edition of the Revised Version. At the beginning, the translation was carried out by a committee of seven persons. The chief translator among them was Dr. C.W. Mateer, who was also the chairman of the committee. It took approximately twenty years to finish this work. But in less than ten years after its completion, this translation was ranked above all the other translations, and it was commonly adopted by readers of different levels.</P><P>When the Lord raised us up, we were standing on others' shoulders and received further enlightenment. We took the Mandarin Union Version as the standard reference, and we used all the recognized English versions. We also used the other Chinese versions as secondary references. We did this not only for comparison and enlightenment, but also to avoid bias or misjudgment. At the same time, we took advantage of the best Bible expositions and lexicons. In addition to these things, we received light from God. As a result, we published the New Testament Recovery Version in 1985. This translation can be considered a collection of the knowledge of the divine revelation received by all the saints throughout the last two thousand years. Now it is laid before us with the hope that it will carry on what was in the past and will lead us to further developments in the future.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING TRAINED IN THE DIVINE REVELATION</H2><P>My main burden in this time is to give you some perfecting in the areas of truth and life. We will have two meetings. In the first meeting, we will fellowship about being trained in the divine revelation, and in the second meeting, we will fellowship about being cultivated in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Sixty-six Books of the Bible<br>Being the Complete Revelation of God<br>Which Cannot Be Added to or Subtracted From</H2><P>The Bible's revelation is altogether founded on the truth. Whatever is hidden in God is a mystery. When this mystery is manifested, it is a revelation. Then when this revelation is seen by us, it is the truth. The Bible is a book of divine revelation (2 Tim. 3:16-17). It has passed through many generations, and it was written by many hands. From the Pentateuch at the beginning of the Old Testament to the book of Revelation at the end of the New Testament, there are altogether sixty-six books. It took approximately fifteen to sixteen hundred years to complete. Before the writing of the New Testament, God's revelation was not yet complete. When the apostle Paul became a minister of the church in the New Testament, he completed the Word of God (Col. 1:25-26) and fully presented the divine revelation. With the epistles of James, Peter, John and Jude and the book of Revelation, the Bible was fully completed. Hence, at the end of the Bible there is a warning, saying that no one can add anything to or delete anything from this book (Rev. 22:18-19). Therefore, we need to read every book, every chapter, and every verse of the Bible, lest we miss our appointed blessing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Understanding the Bible, Exercising<br>Our Spirit, Having Our Mind Opened, and<br>Having Our Faculties Exercised</H2><P>Luke 24:45 says, "Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures." This indicates that in order to understand the Bible, we need the opening of our mind through the enlightening of the Lord's Spirit. Otherwise, we will not have any way to understand it. Hebrews 5:13-14 also tells us that in order to partake of God's word, our faculties, that is, our senses or our understanding, need to be exercised through practice. In reading the Lord's word, the mental capacity and the spiritual understanding need to be continually exercised.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Bible Needing to Be Opened<br>in Order to Give Forth Light</H2><P>Psalm 119:130 says, "The entrance of thy words giveth light." Many passages in the Bible cannot be understood without explanation. We can see this from the case of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8. When Philip saw him, he was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah. Philip asked, "Do you really know what you are reading?" The eunuch said, "How can I unless someone guides me?" (vv. 30-31). Verse 32 then says, "Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He does not open His mouth." While he was reading, the eunuch did not understand who the "He" referred to. Hence, there was the need for Philip to explain to him so that he could preach to him Jesus as the gospel and lead him to believe and be baptized.</P><P>In the same way, there are many passages in the Bible which require explanation before one can understand them. The following list contains some examples of such passages: 1) the seventy weeks (Dan. 9:24), 2) the epistle of Christ written on the hearts of the believers with the Spirit of the living God (2 Cor. 3:3), 3) Christ making His home in our hearts (Eph. 3:17), 4) being filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19), 5) unto the dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things (Eph. 1:10), 6) becoming the God-chosen inheritance in Christ (Eph. 1:11), 7) the mystery of God being completed at the time of the blowing of the seventh trumpet (Rev. 10:7). If you merely read passages like these by yourself without any guidance from others, you will not understand them, even if you read them many times. Therefore, your training here is first a training on the truths.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Most Comprehensive Way to Read<br>the Bible Based on the Experience<br>of Believers throughout the Ages</H2><P>Now I would like to show you the most comprehensive way to read the Bible based on the experience of believers throughout the ages. There are three methods to do this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Being Nourished Daily in the Spiritual Life<br>by Pray-reading Two or Three Verses<br>Sequentially through a Book of the Bible<br>Every Morning for Ten to Fifteen Minutes</H2><P>You should spend ten to fifteen minutes early every morning to do nothing else but to sequentially pray-read two or three verses from a designated portion of the Bible. During this time, you should not merely read but pray-read, that is, to speak to the Lord directly with the Lord's word and to pray the Lord's word into you. This is the best way to be nourished in your spiritual life. Although everyone is busy during the day with very little extra time, everyone can get up fifteen minutes earlier. Whoever is willing can do it. This way is suitable for everyone. At the beginning, it may require some effort, but after a while, it will become your habit. Moreover, this way of reading helps you to retain the Lord's word in your heart easily. During the day you can "chew" on these words again and again, digesting and receiving the Lord's supply from them. This is the first method of reading, and it is the most necessary one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Studying a Book of the Bible in Depth<br>for Thirty Minutes Every Day</H2><P>The way of studying the Bible by diving into a particular book should not be overlooked. Although we may pray-read two or three verses of the Bible every morning and obtain spiritual nourishment and light, the degree of help we receive may differ. If your knowledge of the Bible is deep, the nourishment you obtain will be rich. Because their knowledge of the Bible is not so accurate, the supply many obtain is not very proper. Therefore, reading the Bible requires an accurate understanding. Of course, a wrong understanding in reading the Bible is better than not reading at all. But understanding the Bible correctly is certainly better than misunderstanding it. However, an accurate understanding in reading the Bible depends on the reader's degree of knowledge of the Bible. For this reason, we have to receive the teaching, and continuously dig deeper into the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Speed-reading Three Chapters of the Old Testament<br>and One Chapter of the New Testament<br>for Fifteen Minutes Every Day</H2><P>Another way to read the Bible is speed-reading. The best time to do this is after lunch. You should read four chapters each time in a sequential way&#151;three in the Old Testament starting from Genesis and one in the New Testament starting from Matthew. This kind of reading does not require much thinking; you do not need to try to understand. Simply read through the chapters quickly. It does not matter if you understand or remember what you have read. Simply read on step by step every day. In the long run, you will surely get the help. In spiritual things, do not try to be too fast or to do too much. The most valuable way in spiritual matters is to do things a little at a time. This is like little streams that flow for a long time. It would be marvelous if we could read the Bible in this way throughout the entire year.</P><P>I treasure very much the fact that you can devote one or two years of your time to wholeheartedly be trained here while you are young. In the church, many spiritual things are received from and taught by others. You have learned most of your knowledge of the truths from me. There is very little that you have that was not received from others. I myself was the same way. In the first forty years of my Christian life, nearly everything I had was learned through others. Later, the Lord was merciful to me and gave me some light directly. I was able to see the matters of God's economy, God's dispensing, God's mingling with man, and so forth. I had this latent ability to understand these things not only because of the growth in life, but also because of the training in the Bible. This is like a person who wants to advance in education. He must reach a certain level of proficiency first before he can do research and discover new things.</P><P>The Bible is not a common book but a highly specialized book. It is not something that man can understand with his natural mentality. I do not believe that as soon as a person opens up the Bible, he can see the light within it and acquire an accurate understanding. Therefore, studying the Bible requires teaching. The simplest way for us to teach people to read the Bible is to give them a kind of leading, guidance, or adjustment in a spontaneous way. This kind of teaching is best carried out when you are pray-reading with others or when praying in the meeting. Spontaneously, as you are pray-reading or praying with others, some words will come out which contain the enlightening or teaching element. When others receive the supply, they will also receive the leading. In order to have this kind of prayer in the Lord, you have to have a great deal of knowledge of the Bible. According to my experience, a proper prayer is with power, and this real power comes from your accumulated labor on the Word of God through the years. Suppose some of you have not yet graduated from college, and you come here to be trained. You will feel that the training is strenuous because your mental capability has not received enough development. You will also find out that there are things that you cannot understand.</P><P>There is one more thing that I have to make clear to you. The word of the Bible is our food. It is not physical food, but spiritual food. The physical food does not need to pass through our mind. It goes directly into our stomach and is digested. However, since the Bible is spiritual food, it needs to pass through our understanding. Suppose a person does not know English, yet you give him an English Bible to read. He will have no way to comprehend it. Therefore, in order to partake of the Lord's word, we must use our spirit and exercise and train our understanding.</P><P>The Bible is the embodiment of God. Hence, this spiritual food is simply God Himself. When it comes into our being, we will not only be satisfied, but God will be dispensed into us. As a result, we will grow with the growth of God (Col. 2:19). Therefore, after you graduate from college, and before you step into society, you should set aside two years to be trained here. This will cause you not only to be filled in life, but also to be educated in the truths. This will surely be a big profit to your experience of human life in the future. For you to be able to do this is a blessing. Unconsciously, your entire being will be affected; your thought, concept, and knowledge of people and of God will be different. This is not only a blessing to you personally, but also to your family. In the future it will be a blessing to society, and it will also be a big help to the church.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on October 16, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BEING CULTIVATED IN THE DIVINE LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Col. 3:4a; Gal. 2:20a; Phil. 1:21a; Eph. 3:17, 19; 4:15; Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:13; Col. 1:28</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Christ being our life&#151;Col. 3:4a.</li><li>Christ living in us&#151;Gal. 2:20a.</li><li>For to me to live being Christ&#151;Phil. 1:21a.</li><li>Christ making His home in our hearts, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God&#151;Eph. 3:17, 19.</li><li>Growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things&#151;Eph. 4:15.</li><li>Holding the Head, growing with the growth of God&#151;Col. 2:19.</li><li>Being full-grown in Christ&#151;Eph. 4:13; Col. 1:28.</li></ol><P>In the last chapter we saw the matter of being trained in the divine revelation. In this chapter we will see the matter of being cultivated in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST BEING OUR LIFE</H2><P>The first thing we have to see is that Christ is the life of the believers (Col. 3:4a). The life that we have originally is the human life. When we believe in the Lord, we receive another life, the divine life. In God's salvation, He has worked Himself into us and has become our life. Therefore, there are two lives within us, the human life and the divine life.</P><P>We were created in God's image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:26). Genesis 2:7 says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." Hence, man is a living creature. He is like God in that he has a mind, a will, and an emotion, with feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. When we believed in the Lord, another life came in, and we became even more complicated. This is like a person after he gets married. Prior to his marriage, he lived a bachelor's life. But after marriage he has to learn to live one life but with two persons. This becomes more troublesome and difficult. Herein lies a practical problem: since we now have two lives, according to which life do we live?</P><P>God's salvation for us is a person. This person is Christ Himself. God's salvation is Christ as a living person coming into us to be our life. For this reason, we need to cooperate and coordinate with Him. This requires much discipline and learning. For this reason, God not only gave us the Holy Spirit within as our life, but He also gave us the Bible outside of us to teach us the way to cooperate with Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST LIVING IN US</H2><P>Christ is not only our life, but He also lives in us. Galatians 2:20a says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me." This does not mean that since we have received Christ into us, we have exchanged our life with Christ's life and that the superior life of Christ has replaced our inferior life. Although the first half of this verse says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live," the second half of this verse says, "And the life which I now live in the flesh." Hence, it is still I who am living. What is crucified and terminated is the old "I," and what is regenerated with God within as life is the new "I." On the one hand, I have been terminated, and on the other hand, I still live. This is like Romans 6:6, which says that our old man has been crucified with Christ. Verse 11 then says that in Christ we are dead to sin but alive to God. From this we can see that we do not have an exchanged life but a joined life.</P><P>This joined life can be illustrated by the grafting as seen in Romans 11. Here it says that we the Gentiles, who were the wild olive branches, have been grafted into a cultivated olive tree (vv. 17, 20). We have become the branches of Christ, the true vine (John 15:1). Grafting is an organic joining together. It is not to exchange an inferior life for a superior life. Rather, it is the joining of two lives as one, so that there is a mingled life and a mingled living. The joining of the branches to the tree is not an outward union, but an inward mingling. Through the supply of the sap of the tree, a new life element is brought in. As a result, sweet fruit is produced. The life that a Christian has received is such an outwardly-joined and inwardly-mingled life. Christ and we share the same life and the same living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOR TO ME TO LIVE BEING CHRIST</H2><P>We have been joined and mingled with Christ in life. Our living is one of two lives mingled as one life and two spirits mingled as one spirit. The burden of responsibility for this living is not on the Lord but on us. When we speak and walk, is it the Lord who is the Lord, or are we the lord? Christ is already living in us. Whether or not we feel it, He is definitely living in us. Furthermore, we are joined to Him and mingled with Him. For this reason, we Christians should not make up our minds to do anything. We may think that since the Lord has told us to overcome, we must therefore try to overcome, or that since the Lord has told us to be holy, we must therefore try to be holy. It does not mean this at all. Never try to be repentant by yourself and then try to make up your mind by yourself. This is wrong. It will isolate you from your union with the Lord. This is like electricity. When the power source is cut off, electricity will not pass through anything. When we make up our mind, we are trying to do good by ourselves. Paul mentioned this in a clear way in Romans 7. He said, "For to will is present with me, but to do the good is not. For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil I do not will, this I practice. But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me" (vv. 18-20). Sin lives in our flesh. Sin is the evil life and nature of Satan. When it is dormant in us, it is merely sin. But when it is awakened by a will to do good, it becomes evil. As soon as we make up our mind to do good, we bring in the conflict between the good in the mind and the evil in the flesh. This is what the Chinese philosophers described as the war between reason and lust. In the end, we completely fail and are made a captive of sin (vv. 23-24).</P><P>Hence, we must be delivered from this kind of conflict. We should not enter the battle between the flesh and the mind. Rather, we should simply live in our regenerated spirit, reject our natural being, ignore our flesh, and give up the thoughts of doing good. Instead, we should turn and remain in our spirit. At times it is not so easy to remain in the spirit. At these times, we can sing, pray, or testify. This will help us to live in the spirit. In this way, the Lord will gain the ground to be the lord within us. Spontaneously, we will be led of Him to follow Him. Whenever He initiates something, we follow. We move in oneness with Him, and in this way we live Him out. This is what it means for us to say, "For to me to live is Christ" (Phil. 1:21a). It is not Christ Himself alone who lives, but we live Him out through our cooperation with Him and through His union and mingling with us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST MAKING HOME IN OUR HEARTS<br>THAT WE MAY BE FILLED<br>UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</H2><P>According to the requirement of the New Testament, Christ not only wants to live in us, He also wants to make home in our hearts (Eph. 3:17). To make home is different than to be a guest. To make home is to make an arrangement in every room of the house and to live there. Christ is not only living in our spirit. He wants to make home in every part of our heart. In everything and at every time, the Lord wants to do something and to speak something in our whole being, including our mind, emotion, will, and conscience, until these four parts of our heart become fully occupied and filled by Him. In this way, He makes His home in us.</P><P>When Christ makes home in our heart in this way, every part of our heart&#151;our mind, emotion, will, and conscience&#151;will have Him as the Lord; we will no longer be the lord. In this way, we will receive His leading. We will be led of Him and will move according to Him. We cooperate with Him to have a joined and mingled living. In this way, our move becomes His move; our speaking becomes His speaking; our work becomes His work. This is Christ making home in our hearts. It is also our growth in life. By Christ making home in our hearts, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GROWING INTO THE HEAD, CHRIST,<br>IN ALL THINGS</H2><P>If we are not the lord in all things and do not act independently, allowing Christ to be the Lord and following Him, Christ will increase in us, and we will grow into Him, the Head, Christ, in all things (Eph. 4:15). Even in the small things, such as cutting and combing our hair, dressing ourselves, shopping, and contacting and speaking with others, we should allow Christ to be the Lord. We must pay attention to the inner feeling within us, following Him and living together with Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOLDING CHRIST AS THE HEAD,<br>GROWING WITH THE GROWTH OF GOD</H2><P>When we hold the Head, Christ, and grow into Him in all things, God will grow within us, and we will grow gradually in life and function through the increase of God's element within us (Col. 2:19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING FULL-GROWN IN CHRIST</H2><P>When we grow with the growth of God, we will become full-grown (Eph. 4:13; Col. 1:28). Once we become full-grown in Christ, victory, sanctification, spirituality, riches, and even authority will all become ours. Furthermore, we will be able to be joined with others to become the Body, the fullness of Christ.</P><P>What I hope to see, on the one hand, is that you would be trained in the truth, and on the other hand, that you would be cultivated in life. You must be firmly established in the truth. Every day you must read the Bible for the nourishment of your spiritual life. Pray-read two or three verses every morning, eating the Lord's word and enjoying Him properly. This will supply your need for the day. In addition to this, you have to study the Bible every day and dive into the depths of every book. Do not read over them lightly; pursue them seriously. At the same time, you have to speed-read three chapters of the Old Testament and one chapter of the New Testament every day. You must be trained in these three areas. This will become your capital in your future Christian life, work, and service. In addition to these, you have to grow in life. In this way, spontaneously, you will have a way to serve the Lord.</P><P>If the Lord commissions you more, so that you have no more time to take a job, you should follow the Lord's leading to look to the Lord by faith and to serve Him full-time. If in your circumstances no saint or church can support you, you have to learn of Paul's example. At times, he worked with his own hands to supply himself and the needs of his companions (Acts 20:34). Among us there is no such profession as preaching. If you feel that you are not that useful in the hand of the Lord, you can spend half of your time to take a job, to earn a living, so that you would not become a burden to others. Perhaps after two years of training, the Lord will lead you to continue your education. Perhaps the Lord will arrange for you to take a job first. After two or three years, according to your inner feeling and as the Lord leads in the outward circumstances, you may serve full-time again.</P><P>I hope this little fellowship will become clear to all of you and will give you the boldness to consecrate yourself. Do not say that to be full-time is right and that not to be full-time is wrong. These feelings are unnecessary. If you can make it, serve full-time. If you cannot make it, take a job. The rest of your time, you should still love the Lord and pursue after Him. Being full-time is only a matter of degree; it is not a matter of being a full-timer or not being one. At any rate, all of us should pursue the Lord in being perfected in the truth and growing in life.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on October 18, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ENCOURAGEMENT AND INSTRUCTIONS<br>FOR THOSE PARTICIPATING IN<br>THE GOSPEL EVANGELIZATION WORK</H1><P>This meeting is mainly for those who are participating in the evangelization work in the villages. Those trainees who are presently in the training are also invited to attend, because in the future, they will also be taking the same way. Although I do not have an outline for you, I do have a definite burden to fellowship with you in a thorough way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO CONCEPT OF TITLE, RANK, OR POSITION</H2><P>The full course of our training is two years. The first year is for training here in the training center. The second year is for practice in the villages. The first thing I want you to know clearly is that among us, there is no title, rank, or position. On the one hand, the Bible tells us that through the grace received, some have the function of apostles. On the other hand, the Bible also shows us that we are all brothers. If anyone desires to be great, he has to be the servant of all (Matt. 20:26-27). This word annuls all concepts of title, rank, and position in the church. For this reason, there must never be any hierarchical concept with us.</P><P>Some may consider me to be an apostle. But who can tell? Even I myself cannot tell this. But I do know of the Lord's commission to me. I cannot deny what I can do and that I have a portion that others cannot replace. Among us during the past two or three years, there were some problems. Whether others exalt me or attack me, I have not been affected because I have been following the Lord. I will never do anything divisive, and I will never oppose anyone. But when it comes to the matter of the truth, I never give in. I will always stand for the truth. Every one of us as a saved one has our capacity, that is, our function or our gift, in the Body of Christ. Yet we do not have titles, ranks, or positions. It is true that in the church there are elders, and that the younger ones should submit to the older ones. However. this should not be a matter of position. Rather, it should be a matter of function.</P><P>For many years, I have felt uneasy about using the term co-workers for fear that this matter would develop into a special rank among us. If anyone has this concept, I would beg you to drop it. In the Body of Christ there are different members. There are the big members and the small members, the high members and the low members. However, this is not a matter of position but a matter of function. For example, the two eyebrows are higher than the two eyes. The difference in location is due to their difference in function. According to the Bible, everyone who belongs to the Lord is a member in the Body of the Lord and should therefore be a co-worker. All the members should do the same work of building up the Body of Christ. For this reason, we should not consider the term co-worker as a special title. However, it is all right to call someone a full-timer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXPERIENCING SPIRITUAL WARFARE AND<br>LEARNING SPIRITUAL LESSONS</H2><P>While I was away, I often received letters from you, and I have heard some news concerning you. According to my understanding, your evangelization work in the villages during the past year or so has not been without spiritual warfare. In some places, you fast twice a week to meet the need. This is surely right. Furthermore, in the experience of life you have definitely learned more spiritual lessons than you would have learned by being in a big church. But I would still say a word. The most precious thing in the church is the oneness. With oneness there is the blessing. Opinions will only bring in problems. You should not consider quitting the training as a solution, because this would betray your initial consecration of living to the Lord. You should take up the cross and accept all difficulties. Wipe away all tears and follow the Lord to go on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RAISING UP CHURCHES AND PERFECTING MEN</H2><P>I hope that you would understand that the way you are taking is not the way of Christianity, nor is it the way of any work. The way you are taking is the way the Lord has recovered according to His word. The Lord's recovery has been in Taiwan for forty years. During this time, the gospel has never been preached properly. Our burden here is to spread the gospel to at least every village and town and to raise up the Lord's churches in those places. Although your work today does not seem to be very great outwardly and at times appears rather difficult, in reality it is very worthwhile.</P><P>Our goal is that in three years a hundred churches will be raised up in a hundred towns and villages. In every place there will be twenty to thirty saints living the church life in a solid way. Among them, at least three to five will be firm in their faith, clear in the general truth, and have a basic understanding and experience of the spiritual life in Christ and the practical living of the church. These three to five will also have some ability to speak about these matters. Moreover, they will have a stable character, being honest and faithful to others, so that they would not forsake the Lord or the church. As long as there are such brothers, you can slowly let your hands go and let them take up the responsibilities. I believe this situation will be developed within a year or so. At that time you can plan to do other things. This goal is very clear. For this reason, you have to begin perfecting others now. While you are working, you must have the discernment to see who are the suitable ones. It would also be good if you can raise up three to five sisters who can take the lead among the sisters. All these ones need your proper perfecting. For this reason, from now on, on the one hand, you have to gain new ones, but on the other hand, you have to perfect men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SEEKING THE TRUTH<br>AND DIVING INTO THE BIBLE</H2><P>You can see where you must give yourselves to labor from now on. First, you must grow in life. This is a basic necessity. Second, you must study the truth in depth. Every day, you must have a set time of at least an hour to study the Bible. You should study the important books such as Matthew, John, Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, the four books that make up the heart of the New Testament&#151;Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians&#151;and the book of Hebrews. You should also study 1 and 2 Peter, 1 John, and Revelation. These are the books to study in the New Testament. In your study of the Old Testament, the most basic books are those of the Pentateuch. Even if you cannot study them by yourself, you have to thoroughly read through the Life-study messages on these five books. During the past decades, I have done my best to thoroughly present to you the riches in these five books. I am standing on the shoulders of my predecessors in order to advance further. All the things presented are reliable and real. All you have to do is to dive into them.</P><P>We know that in-depth knowledge is not gained overnight. The cultivation of knowledge is a life-long matter. For this reason, you have to spend time in the Lord's word every day. This will affect your work in the villages and will help you to know how to cultivate others to be pillars in the church, that is, those who can be leaders. If you do not do this, your teachings will be shallow, and your work will not see much result. However, if you dive into the Lord's word daily and become fully rooted and grounded, what you speak will be different, and the result will be different. Let me repeat again. The next year is a crucial time. If you can perfect others, your work will have lasting value. And the value of your work in turn depends on the degree of your understanding of the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DOING THE BEST TO STUDY LANGUAGES</H2><P>Another necessary thing for you to do is to study languages. You are all young and have learned some foreign languages in school. This is very good. Whether or not you will go abroad in the future, you must know at least two languages&#151;your native language and a foreign language. Generally speaking, the most useful language is English. Next to English, Spanish is very useful. You should make the effort to study them. Do not simply learn them in a general way. You must study the grammar and the vocabulary. The more you study these things, the better it will be. In addition, you must learn the syntax. I hope that you would try your best to study these matters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT BEING PROUD OR JEALOUS,<br>BUT PRESERVING THE ONENESS AND<br>WORKING FOR THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>I must remind you of one thing. In serving the Lord, there is no need to show yourselves off. Do not think that you are now better than others. You should also not expect others to follow you. To do this is a shame. The wisest thing to do is to try your best to learn from others. This is like the Lord's word in Luke 8:18 which says, "For whoever has, it shall be given to him." If you are not willing to learn from others, you will have less and less, but if you are willing to learn continually, the Lord's work will have a bright future with you. Even if you have indeed learned something, do not have any intention of showing yourselves off or of feeling proud about yourselves. Moreover, you should not be jealous of others when they have learned more or have done better. What I know I will teach to others. What I cannot do, others can do. Not only should I not be jealous, I also should learn from them. This is the right way. In this way the oneness among us can be preserved, and there will be the one accord among us. Otherwise, the oneness will be gone, and there will be division.</P><P>In addition, if there is any blessing in your work, never think that you are the only one who can do it, and that everyone around you has to come to you. You should never do this. Even if others come in this way, you should not take them in. It is all right if they come seeking to fellowship and to learn, but you must not give others the impression that you know more than they do, and that only you can teach. This must be avoided at all cost. You must be clear that what we are doing is the building up of the church. A good method is not the foundation of the building up of the church. Our foundation is Christ Himself. We are not here for others to follow us. Rather, we are here to build up others into the church.</P><P>For this reason, I advise you not to prefer some and despise others. Do not try to be particularly close to anyone. It is right to receive help, but this should not result in any special affiliation. This has always been my attitude. It is enough for you to receive what benefits you. You must never go so far as to say that you are following a certain person. All the gifts are given by the Head to His Body. Moreover, every member has his specialty. We should all learn from one another. May we be those who can truly help others, and may others receive help from us, but we must never hope that others will follow us.</P><P>Every one of us has to learn to do one thing, which is to do the proper and "orthodox" work. We should not do a deviating work. Whatever we do, our work is not ours, but the work of the Lord's recovery. Everything is done for and towards the Lord's recovery. Nothing is done for and towards ourselves.</P><P>We have a general plan that by the summer of 1993, all the ones sent out to the villages for the evangelization work will be called back. In other words, we hope that by then all of the hundred churches will have become self-sufficient. By then, if some of you decide not to be full-timers anymore, you can get  jobs and live in the church life in your localities. Some may pursue more education or go to school abroad. All of these things can be done, and I do encourage you to do this. If some decide to stay in Taipei to continue to serve the Lord, they can go to work on the campuses in order to gain new ones by the new way, to preach the gospel, to bring others to salvation, to nourish them, and to establish group meetings. At the same time, I hope that in the next two or three years some can be sent abroad, first to the United States, and then to other places, spreading from there. This is our general goal. May the Lord lead us.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on October 21, 1990)</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TWO SHORTAGES<br>AND THE TWO SNARES<br>OF THOSE SERVING THE LORD</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 3:23; John 17:22-23; 1 Cor. 3:12-13, 17; Gal. 5:26; Phil. 2:2; 4:2; 1 Tim. 3:6; 1 Cor. 6:18-20; Gal. 5:19-21</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The two shortages:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Coming short of the glory of God&#151;Rom. 3:23; John 17:22-23.</li>	<li>Destroying the temple of God&#151;1 Cor. 3:12-13, 17.</li>	</ol></li><li>The two snares:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Pride&#151;Gal. 5:26; Phil. 2:2; 4:2; 1 Tim. 3:6.</li>	<li>Fornication&#151;1 Cor. 6:18-20; Gal. 5:19-21.</li>	</ol></li></ol><P>This morning is a rare opportunity. I would like to fellowship with you some serious matters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO SHORTAGES OF THE SERVING ONES</H2><P>Brother Watchman Nee once gave an illustration concerning those serving the Lord. He said that they are like clay in the hands of the potter. In the process of making vessels, many become useless. In the end, not many become useful vessels. I heard this warning over fifty years ago. It has given me a great deal of help over the years. I would like to say to you that, as those serving the Lord, we have four problems, that is, we have two shortages and two snares.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Coming Short of the Glory of God</H2><P>The first shortage is that of coming short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). What does it mean to come short of the glory of God? It means that we do not express God. We are created in the image of God. He lives within us. God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. We should also live a life of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. In this way, we express God. If we do not do this, we come short of the glory of God. In the Lord's work, when a few coordinate together and work together for a while, a mutual understanding develops, and it becomes very easy for them to form into a party. Subconsciously, a feeling may arise: "This is our group" or "The others are different from what we are." The result is that we only care for our own work and do not care whether others have the opportunity to work or not. If this is the case, even if we are very successful, we are not building up the Body of Christ.</P><P>We have to realize that when we serve the Lord, we are not doing our own work. Rather, we are building up the Body of Christ. Hence, our work should not turn others to us but to the church. If those that you have brought to the Lord would go to another nearby church for the sake of convenience, you should rejoice over it. You should even encourage them to do this. You should not consider that, since he was one that you brought to the Lord and one that you have spent a lot of time and labor on, he should therefore not go to meet in another locality. This kind of thought does not glorify God. John 17:22-23 tells us that the Lord has given the believers the glory that the Father has given to Him and that they are now able to receive His sonship with the Father's life and the divine nature, so that they may express the Father in the Son. Today every one of us as a saved person has received God's life and nature and has become God's expression. However, in the Lord's work, if we are divided among ourselves or are fighting with one another for the people that we have brought to the Lord, it will be a great shame to God and will not be a glorious thing at all for the saved ones.</P><P>Furthermore, in serving the Lord, we should not have too intimate a relationship with anyone. I was with Brother Watchman Nee for eighteen years. Although we were not together all the time, we had much contact with each other for the sake of the Lord's work. We never dined with each other or had tea with each other for any reason that was exclusively personal in nature. Throughout the years, I have had close fellowship with many brothers, but we have never had a kind of special contact. We have always avoided worldly social contacts. You have to settle this matter in your heart. You cannot condemn many things as sin, and certain things may not be wrong in themselves, yet they will cause us to come short. As a result, we will not be able to glorify God. Many evils arise from this matter. You must avoid this matter at all cost.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Destroying the Temple of God</H2><P>Another shortage of those serving the Lord is destroying the temple of God. First Corinthians 3 says, "But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each shall become manifest." Again it says, "If anyone's work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss...If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him" (vv. 12-13, 15, 17). The wood, grass, and stubble here signify the things that originate from the natural background and natural lifestyle of the believers. When a man builds with these worthless materials, he is destroying the temple of God. For this reason, in the Lord's work we must never allow any human flesh or natural affection to be mixed in. Some among the brothers may have rendered you a lot of help, while others may not have rendered as much help to you. However, you should not prefer one above another because of this. There is no special rank or position among us; there are only different functions within the Body of Christ. The church is the Body of Christ. In the Body no one should propose that someone do certain things or recommend that others do a certain work. It is a shame to do these things; they will corrupt, defile, and damage the Body of Christ. I fully agree that we should love each other. I also feel that as long as I have enough food, I should not allow my co-workers to go hungry. I can say this before the Lord because I have done this in a definite way. In spite of this, we must avoid all fleshly relationships, so that we do not destroy the temple of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO SNARES FOR THE SERVING ONES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Pride</H2><P>I have seen much in the way of serving the Lord during the past sixty years. Those who are unable to do something appear common, and those who can do something become proud. Paul told us in Galatians 5 that we should not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another (v. 26). In Philippians 2 he desired that the brothers think the same thing, have the same love, be joined in soul, and think the one thing (v. 2). For this reason, he besought the two sisters, Euodias and Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord (Phil. 4:2). The worst thing that can happen among us is for the co-workers not to be one. This will cause us to lose the Lord's presence, and it will make a hole in our vessel, causing us to lose the Lord's blessings. Once we become proud and despise others, considering our work better than others, there will be a breech, and unnoticeably all the blessings that were brought in will leak away. I have said that we are not here to build up our own work. It is good to preach the gospel, to nourish the lambs, and to have group meetings. However, all these are but the means; they are not the work that we are building. The work that we are building is the Body of Christ.</P><P>Hence, all of us must have the Lord's grace, that no matter how well we have done in the Lord's work, we should always have the attitude described in Luke 17:10. After we have completed the work commissioned by the Lord, we should say that we are but unprofitable slaves and that we have only done what we ought to have done. This is my prayer before the Lord all the time. There are many things that I should have done but have not been able to do. No matter how much we have done, we are merely doing our best to fulfill our duty. Pride is a terrible thing. It will make a person blind and will put him under the judgment reserved for the devil (1 Tim. 3:6). We have to be aware of this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Fornication</H2><P>Another big snare is fornication. In 1 Corinthians 6:18 Paul said, "Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may do is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body." Do not forget that we are fallen and that this age is evil and adulterous. I know for sure that many good brothers have stumbled because of this matter. You have to remember that we are here in the training for the purpose of being trained and sent out to work together. Of course, when a man or a woman grows up, he or she wants to get married, but we should not take any opportunity in the Lord's holy work to pursue after marriage. This will defile the temple of God. I want to give you this warning. Your holy duty is to be trained here and to spread the gospel in the villages. You must flee the snare of fornication.</P><P>The Bible gives many teachings concerning this matter. Paul said in 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that you abstain from fornication; that each one of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor." We cannot sell our body cheaply. Fornication is an extremely filthy matter. Those practicing this will not inherit the kingdom of God (Gal. 5:19-21). This is a most serious thing. I have often told people that it is unavoidable for men and women to have contact with each other in the Lord's work. But the principle must be kept that two of the opposite sex must never talk with each other alone in a closed room. If it is necessary, they should do so in an open place, or they should have another person join them. Personally, I am not old-fashioned. I am not here preaching Chinese culture. Rather, I am here preaching Christ. However, I believe in the Chinese saying which says, "Avoid intimacy between male and female in giving or in receiving." There is a place for this word. In contacting others, a brother should not contact a female alone. Neither should a sister contact a male alone. In this way you will be preserved.</P><P>I hope that these four points will be a warning that you can remember in your heart forever. If you do this, I can guarantee you that your time of serving the Lord will be long-lasting. Otherwise, you may fall into these traps and stumble, having regret for a long, long time. None of these four things can be violated. In the Lord's recovery, your work for the Lord must never give others the impression that you are creating a division or that you are different. At the same time, you must not walk according to the flesh, act rashly, or speak loosely. You must not bring in natural affection or any worldliness, and you should not let others feel that you are proud. You should only do what you should do. All the practices that we have are for the Lord's recovery and for the work of the building up of the Body of Christ. We would rather see that we are forgotten and our proper and orthodox work remains. Lastly, you have to honor your worth and preserve your body with holiness and honor by fleeing fornication.</P><P>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei, Taiwan on October 22, 1990)</P></body></html>
