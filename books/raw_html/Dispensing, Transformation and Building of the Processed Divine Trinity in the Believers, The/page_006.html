<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE DISPENSING OF THE PROCESSED DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:7, 10-11, 13-14; 4:30</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>In redemption—Eph. 1:7:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God the Son dispenses His rich life element into the believers’ inward parts.</li>	<li>Continuing God the Father’s dispensing in regeneration and going along with God the Spirit’s renewing, which follows God the Father’s regeneration.</li>	<li>To constitute the believers as God’s precious inheritance—Eph. 1:11.</li>	<li>That the believers may take the lead among all things to be headed up in Christ to restore the proper order in God’s creation—Eph. 1:10.</li>	</ol></li><li>Through sealing—Eph. 1:13-14:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Through sealing, God the Spirit strengthens the dispensing of God the Father and God the Son.</li>	<li>Sealing the believers with the essence of the Triune God in a gentle and fine way to saturate them until their body is redeemed—Eph. 4:30.</li>	<li>That the believers may bear the image of God as their divine seal.</li>	<li>The divine essence with which the believers are sealed becoming the pledge, guarantee, and foretaste of God as the believers’ inheritance.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In the preceding message we saw that God’s highest purpose concerning man is His desire to build Himself into man; that is, He desires to have His divine element wrought into the created man that He and man may have an organic mingling. In this mingling God’s element increases more and more in man. When God’s element increases in man, man in the condition of the old creation will be gradually renewed and transformed until he becomes completely the new creation. What is the new creation? The new creation is just God Himself. In this universe, only God is “new” and everything else is “old.” Every person, thing, and matter in the universe is old and is becoming old every day. Only our God is “new”; He is ever new and never becomes old. Therefore, when we have this God, we become the new creation. God does not want us to change ourselves, to make ourselves new. God wants us to receive Him, be filled and saturated with Him, and be permeated by Him, that we may have a metabolic change.<p>Christians know and accept the matter of God becoming a man. However, concerning man becoming God, they consider this as something incredible. Some brothers and sisters might have heard and declared this, but within them they may have a question mark concerning it. What! Man becoming God? It seems that this is heresy. The revelation concerning man becoming God is unacceptable to many Christians. However, in church history, during the time of the church fathers, the truth concerning God becoming man that man may become God was generally accepted by the saints. But not long afterward the church was distracted from the vision concerning this truth and the economy of God and became more and more degraded. Hence, today when we speak about man becoming God, people generally feel uncomfortable with it and find it difficult to accept. Today our mind needs to be transformed by being renewed that we may see this truth revealed in the Bible. God became man that man may become God. What a miracle this is! What a mystery this is! Although our mind cannot comprehend it, we need to simply receive it, and then we will be able to enjoy and experience this fact as our reality.
