   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KINDS OF PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us go on to consider the various kinds of people among the children of Israel described in these chapters of Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Priests</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ezekiel 22:26 says, Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we see that the priests violated the word of God, profaned the holy things, and even profaned the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They made no distinction between the holy and the profane, between the clean and the unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because they did not minister the word of God but instead violated it, they cheated and robbed the people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They did violence to the Lord s word and they profaned the name of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is also the situation with certain teachers in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They minister God s word in a violent way, cheating and misleading others by the wrong use of the Word and profaning the name of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Kings</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ezekiel 22:27 goes on to say that the princes, the kings, were in the midst of the land like wolves ravening the prey, shedding blood, and destroying souls for dishonest gain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Like many in today s Christianity, they were anxious to grasp something for their own gain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Prophets</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ezekiel 22:25 tells us that the prophets were like roaring lions devouring souls.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They took the treasure and the precious things, causing many to be widows.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ezekiel 13:4-5 says, O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Like foxes in the desert, the prophets loved to hide and live in a desolate place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is difficult for a fox to live in a proper house, but when a house is desolate, foxes may come in. Furthermore, the prophets would not fill up the gap and make up the hedge during the time of battle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today s situation is similar, for very few Christians are willing to stand in the gap for the Lord s recovery and for the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At Ezekiel s time there were many false prophets who prophesied according to their own heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 22:28 Ezekiel used a parable to describe their manner of prophesying: Her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord God, when the Lord hath not spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here Ezekiel said that their manner of prophesying was like daubing the walls with untempered mortar.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mortar is made from lime and must be thoroughly saturated with water before it is applied to a wall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This would give properly tempered mortar.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the mortar is not thoroughly saturated with water before it is applied to the wall, the rain will wash the mortar away, and the wall will crumble.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The meaning of this parable is that many prophets ministered the word of God in a way that was not properly tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To minister the word of God in such an untempered way is to be not saturated with the Holy Spirit and not soaked with the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today many preachers and teachers are daubing with untempered mortar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They may give a good sermon, but when a storm comes, it is washed away like untempered mortar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A word which is fully saturated with the Spirit and with the experience of the divine life is absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When this kind of word is ministered, it will strengthen God s people to withstand whatever storms may come.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From this we see that we need teaching that is saturated with the Spirit and soaked with the proper experience of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not a matter of eloquence or of speaking words that are pleasant to the ear.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, it is ministering the word of God in a way that is real, solid, and thoroughly saturated with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a word will protect us, strengthen us, build us together, and enable us to stand against every kind of storm.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>An even worse situation than that of the false prophets existed among the daughters of the people, who prophesied out of their own heart 13:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They not only prophesied falsely; they also prophesied when the Lord had not spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This kind of prophesying occurs frequently today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many say, Thus saith the Lord, but the Lord has not spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, in recent years several people have prophesied that the city of Los Angeles would fall into the ocean, and some even predicted the exact date.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But Los Angeles is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They said, Thus saith the Lord, but the Lord never said such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When these prophesies were not fulfilled, they were proved to be false.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In addition to prophesying falsely, these women in Ezekiel also practiced superstition and witchcraft.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For instance, they sewed on a magic band, an amulet, as a superstitious protection from the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They even sewed veils to hunt people 13:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Likewise, today certain pastors, preachers, and ministers speak in a superstitious way, comforting others in a way that is false and not according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Elders</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord told Ezekiel that the elders who came to him to inquire of the Lord had set up idols in their hearts 14:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because of the idols in their hearts, the Lord would not be inquired of by them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They were not honest with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Also, they were ravening and robbing, taking others treasures into their own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In many respects, the situation today is similar.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The People</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>From Ezekiel 22:29 we see that the people used oppression and exercised robbery.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They vexed the poor and the needy, and they oppressed the stranger wrongfully.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord was not able to find anyone among them who could make up the hedge and stand in the gap.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Concerning this, verse 30 says, I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sadly, in today s Christianity the situation is almost exactly the same.</S>
