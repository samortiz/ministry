   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SIN, THE SELF, AND THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Two great problems are sin in the body and self in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In addition, as we will see in the next chapter, there is the problem of the world outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These three things sin, the self, and the world are three strands of a strong cord that binds us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one can release himself from this binding cord, a cord that is a composition of sin, the self, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christians may be quite clear about sin, but not many are clear about the self and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In their experience one of the three strands sin has been broken, but the other two strands the self and the world have not been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result they are still under the bondage of the self on the inside and of the world on the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this chapter we need to see that the strand of the self must be cut.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the next chapter we will see that the strand of the world must also be cut.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only when all three strands of this binding cord have been cut will we be released from bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE SELF BEING THE SOUL WHICH IS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>DECLARING INDEPENDENCE FROM GOD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen that the origin of the self was Satan's injecting his thought into the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we need to see that the self is the soul being independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever the soul is not dependent on God but is independent of Him, the soul immediately becomes the self.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that whenever we do something by ourselves without depending on God we are in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No matter what we are and no matter what we do, as long as we are independent of God we are in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God created man as a soul to be always dependent on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man is a soul Gen 2:7 , and as a soul he should depend on God for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may use married life as an illustration of the dependence of the soul on God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A wife should depend on her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is indicated by a bride's wearing a head covering on her wedding day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Her wearing a head covering signifies that she will take her husband as her head and will depend on him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, there will be two heads, and this will lead to contradicting, fighting, and even divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Just as a wife should depend on her husband, so the soul should depend on God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the soul has become the self.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The self is simply the soul declaring independence from God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have the vision of the self, we will see what the self is the soul declaring its independence from God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we see this vision, we will realize that we can no longer be independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we will say, "I must depend on God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever I do, I must depend on God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever I am, I must depend on God."</S>
