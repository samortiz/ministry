   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church is a house to God, and at the same time, it is also a Body to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may know the term the Body of Christ, but we may not be clear in our understanding concerning the real significance of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church as the Body of Christ means much more than the church as the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the picture of the house of God, the house and the Dweller are two; the house is the dwelling place and the dweller is God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the church being the Body of Christ indicates that the Body is one with Christ in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, the Body and the Head are one complete person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s New Testament economy has accomplished such a marvelous thing to make all the believers parts of the one Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These parts have the same life and the same living that Christ has.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ s life is their life, and Christ s living is their living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s New Testament economy reaches to the extent of making all the believers of Christ the real and true parts of this one, big, universal, divine person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Head and the Body are Christ, the Body is the church, and all the members of the church are the members of this organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is difficult to have a thorough understanding of the Body of Christ because this matter is too mysterious, deep, spiritual, and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have been made parts of Christ, members of Christ 1 Cor 12:27; 6:15a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a divine reality that we have been mingled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Philippians 1:21a Paul said, For to me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Galatians 2:20 he said, It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These verses indicate that we are mingled with Christ and even that we are becoming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is in us and Christ is becoming us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In typology Adam and Eve are an excellent type Gen 2:21-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Essentially, Eve was a rib of Adam, a part of Adam, that came out of Adam and was built up into a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Eve was presented to Adam, he said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh v. 23 . This signifies that the wife is a part of the husband, and the wife comes out of the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the wife is the husband, and the husband is the wife Eph 5:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Neither the husband nor the wife is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Each is a half of one complete person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A husband and wife may be likened to two halves of a melon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the two halves are put together, the melon is whole.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In one particular church meeting many years ago, an older brother arrived and one of the saints said, The first half is here, and the second half is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first half, the husband, was in the meeting already, but the second half, the wife, was on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>None of the married brothers and sisters should consider themselves as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The wife and the husband need each other to be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The wife is the husband s completion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without her, he is a half.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even the standing boards of the tabernacle were not a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Each board was one and a half cubits Exo 26:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the two boards were put together, there was a complete unit of three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even in the church life, each one of us is just half.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need another one to make us whole, to make us complete.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our relationship with Christ today is essential; it is altogether in the intrinsic, divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the Head and we are His organic Body; He is our Husband, and we are His bride, His wife.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He and we together are one complete person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a great mystery which we cannot understand to the fullest extent Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The building up of the church as the Body of Christ is completed through the perfecting work of the gifted persons Eph 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These gifted persons are of four categories the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not build the Body directly but indirectly by perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although the early apostles and prophets who received the revelation of the New Testament are not here, we are still being perfected by them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their revelation in their writings, especially the writings of the Apostle Paul, has done a lot of perfecting work throughout the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fourteen Epistles of Paul are still perfecting us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Day by day we are under the perfecting of the Apostle Paul s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through the perfecting work of the apostles and prophets, we are helped to realize that Christ and the church are the unique reality in this universe, and this is the truth that we have to hold to in love Eph 4:15a .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We hold to the truth in love toward Christ and in love toward the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The building up of the church as the Body of Christ is by the members of the Body growing up into Christ, the Head, in all things Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We all need to grow up into Christ in a practical way in all things, such as the way we dress and the way we cut and comb our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In every way we have to grow into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our growth into Christ is a matter of levels.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may have been saved for three years and gradually during this time we have grown into Christ in a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Later we may grow into Christ in another matter, but still in many things we have not grown into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to grow more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Merely to adjust the believers outwardly is not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A certain young brother may not be very nice to his mother, so we need to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we should not forget that merely correcting him will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must minister some amount of life, some amount of God, into him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When he receives more increase of God, he grows with this increase of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Spontaneously he will have a change in his attitude toward his mother and a change in the way he treats his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not a change by outward correction but by inward transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I do not like to correct the saints, but I like to see the saints grow up into Christ in their relationships with their spouse, their children, their parents, their brothers in Christ, and with all men.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we are growing up into Christ, we are growing practically in all the detailed items of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Among us there is one item in which it is hard to see the growth of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This item is gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Regardless of how old or experienced in Christ the saints may be, very few of them have grown into Christ in the matter of gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Most of us just like to talk about others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We may think that to gossip in bad things is not right but to talk about good things is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may differentiate our speaking into these two categories.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But in God s sight, whenever we speak something that is not necessary, whether it is good or bad, that is gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The biblical term for gossip is idle words Matt 12:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Idle words are words that we do not need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>An idle word is a non-working word, an inoperative word, having no positive function, useless, unprofitable, unfruitful, and barren.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When I was younger, I justified myself in wanting to know about the saints by thinking that I needed to know the things concerning them if I were to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Actually, however, you cannot render people the best help by knowing everything about them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, you can render them much help without knowing anything concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you minister to the saints according to what you know about them, this is to play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is not a pure ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Throughout the years I have learned that to know things concerning the saints is not so healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Whenever I am visiting another place and am staying in a brother s home, I do not use any drawer or closet that I have not been directed to use.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When some saints receive hospitality, they might open all the drawers and closets in the room where they are staying.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They want to see what they can find out about the couple with whom they are staying.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>To know the things of others does not help; instead it damages you.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Once you know something about the saints, you can be sure that you will speak about it to someone sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A husband who has visited another locality and received hospitality in a couple s home may tell his wife when he returns how many pairs of shoes he saw in their closet.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This kind of talk is gossip and will contaminate, defile, and pollute you.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When you are put into a room for hospitality, you should only use what you have been directed to use by the host.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If a certain person has a fault, that is his business.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You have no right to speak about it.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Learn not to touch anything that you do not have the right to touch, and learn not to know anything that you do not have the position to know.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This will keep you in a holy position.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>To know things other than what we need to know is altogether not holy but is common and worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>As long as you know something about another person, be assured that you will speak it sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>To speak it is worse than knowing it.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is gossip and the words that you speak are idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>You may speak the facts, yet your speaking is gossiping, and this damages your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Do not be the information desk of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>To know things about others and to speak them damages you and spreads a killing death, the killing power of the subtle one, in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Hundreds of saints have been killed by gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Our mouths must flow out the words of grace, the words concerning Christ that edify and build up others and that mend and heal the wounds Eph 4:29; Col 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We need to cooperate with our indwelling Lord by stopping our loose speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Then we will grow up into Christ in the matter of gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The building up of the church as the Body of Christ is also through the full knowledge of the Son of God by arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 4:13 and by all the Body being fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply according to the operation in measure of each part.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Then all the Body, out from the Head, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of the Body itself in love 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The Greek preposition for unto means resulting in or issuing in. Actually, the direct building up of the Body of Christ is by all the members functions, and all the members functions will issue, or result in, the building.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>THE NEED FOR THE LORD S WORDS TO BE FULFILLED</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>BEFORE HIS COMING BACK</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The Lord s word concerning the building up of the church as the dwelling place of God and the Body of Christ must be fulfilled before His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 24:35, The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Without the biblical way for us to meet and to serve, the way that is illustrated, shown, and signified in the New Testament, the Lord s words concerning the building up of the church cannot be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The traditional way to meet and to serve surely cannot fulfill the Lord s words concerning the building up of His church.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 are not fulfilled, there is no way for the building up of the house of God and of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>If we do not endeavor to take the scriptural way, this will delay the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The heaven and the earth will pass away at the time of the Lord s coming back, and His words will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Sooner or later verses like 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25 will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>When Christians have a proper way to meet and to serve, that will afford the Lord the possibility to build up the church as the dwelling place of God and as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>I have the assurance that right now the Lord is doing something to bring His people back to the God-ordained way to meet and to serve that He may accomplish all He has prophesied and promised concerning the building up of His church.</S>
