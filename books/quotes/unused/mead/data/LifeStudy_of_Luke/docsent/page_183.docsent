   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Genuine Man s Living by God s Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Express God in God s Attributes</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus had a genuine man s living by God s mind, will, and emotion to express God in God s attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord did not seek His own will but God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He came not to do His own will but to do God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that He came to live as a man not by man s life, but by God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He lived by God s mind, will, and emotion to express God in God s attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These attributes are contained in and mingled with His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Gospel of Luke we have many examples of the Man-Savior s God-man living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consider the case of the good Samaritan 10:25-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the human living of the good Samaritan God was expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God was there empowering Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The love expressed was not simply the Samaritan s human love; it was a human love strengthened, empowered, and enriched by the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, it was a superior love, a surpassing love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consider also the case of Zaccheus 19:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Man-Savior s coming to Zaccheus and His dealing with him we see something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is hard to explain what we see expressed in the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Within Him there is something more than the divine omniscience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Him the excellent divine attributes are present strengthening His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus lived in the way of having His human virtues empowered by the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was true of the Lord Jesus even at the age of twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord Jesus was twelve, He was a human child.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But as we read the account in Luke 2, we see that in this child there was the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s attributes were expressed in His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus lived a genuine human life, yet in His life we see the divine element and also certain divine factors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This life did not express man; it expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the God-man s life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man s Mind, Will, and Emotion</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Becoming the Organs to Contain God s Life</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the living of the Lord Jesus, man s mind, will, and emotion became the organs to contain God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may compare these organs to the fingers of a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Just as the fingers of a glove contain the real fingers, so the Man-Savior s mind, will, and emotion contain God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The five fingers of a glove are not real fingers but contain the five fingers of a human hand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a similar way, the Lord s mind, will, and emotion are organs containing God s mind, will, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was His God-Man living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man s Virtues Becoming a Shell, an Image,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>to Express God s Attributes That God</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May Be Expressed in Man s Living</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Man-Savior s God-man living man s virtues became a shell, an image, to express God s attributes so that God may be expressed in man s living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From this we see that our human virtues our love, brightness, holiness, and righteousness are just a shell, the image created by God in Genesis 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God created man in His image so that God may be expressed in man s living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we see this, we shall have the answer to the question raised in the foregoing message concerning why it was necessary for the Lord Jesus to live on earth for thirty-three and a half years before He died to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If He had lived on earth only a short time, there would have been only a momentary expression of the divine attributes in His living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a brief expression could be compared to a rainbow, which appears for a while and then vanishes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Man-Savior lived a full human life for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>During those years He was proved to be without defect or imperfection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not fail in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His virtues were an image for an expression of God s attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, God was expressed in His living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Constituting the Man-Savior s Qualification</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>and a Prototype to His Believers</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord s God-man living constituted His qualification to be the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the same time, this living constituted a prototype to His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we shall see in the next message, this prototype is for the mass production, the reproduction, of the God-man in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In a factory, a great deal of time may be spent to produce a prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once the prototype has been produced, it is then used for mass production.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In a similar way, the Man-Savior s God-man living constituted Him a prototype so that He may now be reproduced in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Praise the Lord for the prototype and for the mass production!</S>
