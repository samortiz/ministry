   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FILLED IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 5:18-19 is parallel to Colossians 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these verses Paul says, Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Notice that in Colossians 3:16 Paul tells us to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly, but in Ephesians 5:18 he tells us to be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we put these verses together, we see that we should be filled in spirit with the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two portions of the Word have the same goal that we should have our spirit filled with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may compare our spirit to an automobile needing gasoline, and the Word, the Bible, to a gas station.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we sense that we are empty, we should come to the Word to be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Word we have an inexhaustible supply of spiritual gasoline.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way to pump this gasoline into us is by singing and psalming the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are filled in this way, surely we shall speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We shall also discover that singing and psalming the Word are higher than pray-reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we sing and psalm the Word of God, the more we shall be delivered from the influence of religion, the influence which causes us to come to the meetings in a formal way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us build up the habit of singing the Word day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then our meetings will not be formal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of any kind of performance, the meetings will be filled with an exhibition of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What we exhibit in the church meetings will be the way we live day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In particular, we shall sing in the meetings because we sing the Word daily.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning the singing of the Word of God, my main burden is not that the meetings will be enriched; it is that we shall be saturated with the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We shall participate in the bountiful supply of the Spirit and enjoy the riches of Christ by receiving the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the past I lost many opportunities to be saturated with the Word because I did not know to sing the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I spent a great deal of time reading and studying the Bible, filling several Bibles with notes, but I did not realize I could sing or psalm the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is one thing to read Ephesians 2 and another thing to pray-read it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But once again I wish to emphasize that singing the Word is even better than pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many of today s Christians exercise only their mind to read and study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They do not sing the Word at all, and some actually oppose the practice of pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am confident that the more we sing and psalm the Word, the more we shall be washed by and saturated with the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>RECEIVING THE WORD TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning those things necessary for life, what is important is not understanding, but receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may not understand very much about the water we drink and especially about the food we eat, but we need to drink and eat nevertheless.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By eating and drinking we receive what is necessary to maintain life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In like manner, we need to receive the Word into us by eating it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yes, we can eat the Word by reading it in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, from experience we know that we can take the Word as food by pray-reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But now we must go on to see that there is no better way to receive the Word into our being than by singing the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we sing and psalm the Word of God, the more it will sink into the depths of our being and saturate us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we take even a little time to sing the Word, we shall sense that we are inwardly filled and saturated with it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then spontaneously we shall live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the element of Christ has been infused into us by our singing and psalming the Word, we live Christ spontaneously and automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes we may read the Word without having any element of Christ infused into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when we sing and psalm the Word, we are saturated with the divine element contained in the Word and conveyed to us through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we sing and psalm the Word, the more we give opportunity to the Word to dwell in us, sink into us, and permeate us with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we shall be constituted of the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Automatically we shall become what we eat and live out what we have absorbed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the way to live Christ.</S>
