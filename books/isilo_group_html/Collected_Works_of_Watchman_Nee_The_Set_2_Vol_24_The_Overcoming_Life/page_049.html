In describing joy, the Bible either uses the word great, or full, or always. Always means all the time. Paul was saying, "Have you heard this word? If you have not heard it yet, let me repeat it for you: `Again I will say, rejoice.'" If we did not get it yet, he would repeat it once more&mdash;that we should rejoice. The life that God gives is a life of joy. Rejoicing is the daily life of a Christian. There may be tribulation and trial, but there is still rejoicing. The opposite of rejoicing is being anxious. Many people are anxious for their children, their money, or their business. But the Word of the Lord says, "In nothing be anxious" (Phil. 4:6). We think that anxiety is justified, but the Lord says, "In nothing be anxious." This is because we should always rejoice.</P><P>If we do not rejoice for a day, we have sinned that day. Once a brother was preaching at a conference on being anxious in nothing. When a sister heard this, she was very angry. She thought, "How can a person not be anxious. If the brothers would be a little more anxious, they could serve us better food." (The brothers were the ones taking care of the food during that conference.) But the Lord could not let her go. She eventually saw that anxiety is a sin, and she overcame.</P><P>I can say much more about this subject. Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12:10, "I am well pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions and distresses." Paul rejoiced in weaknesses, insults, necessities, persecutions, and distresses. Brothers and sisters, we do not know what will befall us. We do know, however, that while we are living on this earth, our circumstances will not always go our way. Some are sick; others have family members who are sick. Some have relatives who are dying, and others are facing persecution. What are we going to do? We may say, "Lord, I will endure," but saying that means that we have failed. If we say, "Lord, I thank and praise You," we will be victorious and Christ will be manifested in us. We will provide the Lord a chance to manifest His power, and we will rejoice. This is our daily life on earth. We should rejoice and thank and praise the Lord all the time.</P><P>First Thessalonians 5:18 says, "In everything give thanks." We should give thanks in everything. Colossians 3:17 says, "And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him." These two passages of the Scriptures encompass everything. Whatever we have missed in the other passages are included in these two verses. I thank and praise the Lord. I can say, "Hallelujah." Others may wonder what is happening to us, but we can give thanks in everything and praise the Lord for everything. Brothers and sisters, if we do this, we will prevail over every temptation, and we will withstand every trial. No tribulation or trial will touch us. Those who go this way will find the strength for their temptations. We can thank and praise the Lord for temptations because we have obeyed the Lord.</P><P>Some may think that I am against endurance. Endurance is precious, and it is right to endure. However, the kind of endurance we want is not an endurance that comes by gritting our teeth. Colossians 1:11 says, "Unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy." We endure and suffer with joy. This is not an unwilling or bitter endurance. The daily tone of the Christian life is one of endurance and long-suffering with joy. In everything we give thanks, and in everything we offer praise. This is a life in the third heavens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S VICTORY MORE THAN CONQUERS</H2><P>Why must the overcoming life be manifested in rejoicing? Why must we rejoice before we can say that we have the overcoming life? Romans 8:37 says, "But in all these things we more than conquer." God gives only one kind of victory, the victory that more than conquers. Any victory that barely makes it is not a victory from the Lord. The victory that the Lord gives is the victory that more than conquers. The victory that barely makes it and barely carries us over the top is not a victory at all. The Lord's victory is always one that more than conquers, and the only way to have the victory that more than conquers is by rejoicing.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, our cup is running over. Everything that God gives runs over. Anything that does not run over is not from God. The kind of victory that God gives is, "Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. And to him who wishes to sue you and take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also; and whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two" (Matt. 5:39-41). The victory that runs over is God's victory. Barely overcoming is a man-made victory; it is the product of human effort.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, this is the tone of victory. May God open our eyes to see that any victory that does not more than conquer is just an imitation victory. While we are suppressing and wrestling, we are only imitating victory. If Christ lives in us, we will rejoice in everything, and we will thank and praise the Lord. We will say, "Hallelujah! Praise the Lord" forever.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 24: The Overcoming Life &nbsp; pg 49</div><br></body></html>
