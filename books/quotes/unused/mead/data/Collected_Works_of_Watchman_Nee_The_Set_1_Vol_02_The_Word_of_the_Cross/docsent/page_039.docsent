   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX UNIVERSAL FATHERHOOD: A FALLACY FOREWORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The teaching of a universal fatherhood, that is, the teaching that says everyone in the world is a child of God, is one of the many important questions in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If all the people in the world are God's children, then they do not have to repent, they do not have to confess their sins, and there is no need to receive the Lord Jesus as Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since all are already children of God, there is no need to have any new relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if this is not the case, then the gracious gospel revealed in the Bible becomes necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is willing to save the world which is at enmity with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, we are willing to look into what God in His Bible has taught us concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May God open our eyes that we will not be deceived by the philosophy of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At present, there is a very popular and modernistic teaching which says that God is the Father of all mankind and that all people in the world are brothers and children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some reason that at the time the Lord Jesus was born, the Jews had a very narrow concept of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this reason, Christ purposely made known the matter of the universal fatherhood in order to make people understand that He was not a mighty and terrifying God, but a very kind and loving Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That was why He taught the disciples to pray, saying, "Our Father who is in the heavens" Matt 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of saying is very appealing to people, but it is a sugar-coated, poisonous pill.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This pleases the unregenerated, fleshly people, because they do not have to worry about their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is their Father, and no father would send his son to hell as a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not have to be born again, they do not need to repent, they do not need to abstain from sin, nor do they have to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since God is their Father, He loves them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They do not have to believe or rely on the Lord Jesus, nor do they have to receive Him as their Savior because they are already the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They think that God only loves, so He will not punish the wicked by eternal damnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of teaching is extremely dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the enemy of the gospel and the destroyer of man's faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It deceives people, leads people into eternal suffering, and makes them hopeless cases.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Christ came, although He called God His Father, He did not preach that God was the Father of everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, He told the people that they should have a change of father in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus only referred to God as the Father of His disciples, not as the universal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must pay attention to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thank God that He has given us the Bible to be our tutor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's Word is infallible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's Word is our supreme court, and it answers all our questions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All human reasonings have no standing before God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our God does not leave His people in the dark.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He will give discernment to those who are humble; He will teach the meek His way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are truly humble, meek, and willing to be taught, God will surely teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching" John 7:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>May the Holy Spirit of God lead us in this study that we may understand the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE GOD REVEALED BY THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are many times in the Old Testament when God is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Isaiah 63:16 says, "For You are our Father."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jeremiah 31:9 says, "I am a Father to Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, the way to enter into the Holy of Holies had not yet been opened; therefore, the beloved Israelites still could not have an intimate fellowship with God like that of a father and son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Lord Jesus came, He revealed the fatherhood of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Sermon on the Mount, seventeen times the Lord Jesus referred to God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Except for the last time Matt 7:21 , when He called God His own Father, all the other times He said, "your heavenly Father," "your Father," or "our Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Matthew there are altogether forty-three references to God as the Father, and of these, twenty-one refer to Him as the Father of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are five references in Mark, twice as the Father of the Lord Jesus, once as the Father only, and the remaining two times as the Father of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Luke mentions God as the Father two times, God as the Father of the disciples three times, and God as the Father of the Lord Jesus eight times.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John, the gospel of the Son of God, refers to God as the Father one hundred fourteen times.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With the exception of the last section, the whole book refers to God as the Father of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In chapters fourteen to seventeen alone, in His last discourse and prayer, our Lord called God the Father about fifty times.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without a doubt the Lord Jesus intended to reveal God as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the end of His prayer, He said, "And I have made Your name known to them" John 17:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This name is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The God whom the Lord Jesus revealed is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, even though the Lord Jesus revealed God's fatherhood, we must determine if this fatherhood is particular or general.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is God the Father of certain people or the Father of the whole world?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are only a part of the world God's sons, or are all His sons?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to answer these questions very carefully because if everyone is a son of God, as some have preached, then the relationship of all people with God is the same; there is no distinction among them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since all people are created by God, it follows that all are born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should therefore love one another, for we all came from one loving Father, and someday we will all go to the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If one is saved, then all are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is really no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is no judgment because God is our Father, and there is no hell because God is a loving Father.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is no Savior because we have no need of Him!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On the other hand, if not everyone is a son of God, then we have to seek to know how we can become children of God, so that we will not be punished by God later.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First we will look at:</S>
