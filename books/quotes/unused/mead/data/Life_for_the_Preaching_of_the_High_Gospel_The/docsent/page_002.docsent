   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible is the divine revelation.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In fundamental Christianity most of the messages are concerning man's personal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is difficult to hear anything on God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I hope that all of us can see what the purpose of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we want to see God's purpose, we must come to the divine book, the Holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The center of God's eternal purpose is man.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From God's Word we see that the center of God's universe is man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there were no human life on this earth, the universe would become meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible says in Genesis 1 that God first created the heavens and then the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After this He created all the things of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He began with the creation of the things of the lowest form of life, the life that is without consciousness, which is the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Following this, God created the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The animal life is higher than the plant life because the animal life is a life with consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, God created the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we have the plant life as the lowest life, the animal life as the higher life, and then the human life as the highest life of all the created things.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Would you like to live in a place without any green things or without any animals?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Surely no one would like to live in such a place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without life, the universe becomes meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God, however, created all kinds of life the plant life, the animal life, and the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The different kinds of plant life the trees, the flowers, and the grass are for beauty.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is beautiful because of the abundance of life.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without the human life, there would be no one to enjoy the beauty of the plant life and the stimulation of the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man is the one who manages and enjoys these created lives.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why God did not create man first.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He first created the plant life and then the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then He created man to enjoy and to exercise dominion over all things.</S>
