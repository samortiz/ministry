   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO BECOME THE CHILDREN OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since not all who are in the world are the children of God, and since the children of God are as described above, the most important question is how can one become a child of God?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words, what is the way to change the children of Satan into the children of God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we can become sons, we must first be born.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You cannot be a son without being born.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first step to become a son is by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before we become the sons of God, we must be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although not all the people in the world are the sons of God, yet all the people in the world can become the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It all depends on their desire and willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The birth in the flesh is beyond man's own control.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One's parents, relatives, and the place, time, and circumstance of birth are not up to one's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet the marvelous grace of God is that if a man decides to choose to become a son of God, he can attain it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although he cannot regenerate himself, yet he can believe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of his believing, God regenerates him, and he becomes a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus" Gal 3:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's way is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whoever sees the danger of being a child of Satan and the calamities that are to come, and desires to become a son of God, does not need to do anything; all he needs to do is believe in the testimony of God concerning His Son, Jesus Christ, to trust in Him wholeheartedly, to obey Him, to accept Him as Savior by faith, to believe in the effectiveness of the salvation which He accomplished on the cross, and by faith to offer Jesus Christ up as the sinner's sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God will instantly forgive his sins, justify him, put a new life in him, and cause him to become a new creature in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will immediately become a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To believe in Christ Jesus is nothing more than to accept the Lord Jesus as Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God" John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now the door of grace is open wide.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be a child of God is not a matter of self-mortification, of trusting in one's own righteous deeds, nor of gradual evolution into a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, it is in that split second of time when one receives the Lord Jesus as Savior and trusts in His accomplished salvation that one has the authority to become the child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who are to be the children of God must have the authority; they cannot freely proclaim themselves His sons, as others who think that all those in the world are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not a self-given authority, but something given by Christ at the time man receives Him as Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason Christ can give man such authority is that He died on the cross for man and has already solved all the problems of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because Christ has taken away the sins of the world, those who believe in Him are forgiven of their sins and are delivered from the punishment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once the problem of sin is solved, nothing can hinder those who believe in Him from receiving grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once the past sins have been dealt with, the Holy Spirit of God will put God's life and nature into the hearts of those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once they have the life of God within, they will instantly become the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regeneration happens at the moment when the life of God enters into their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The work of regeneration is altogether the work of God: "Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God" v 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In John 3, our Lord spoke clearly to Nicodemus concerning the truth of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He used the cross as the foundation of regeneration, the Holy Spirit as the Mediator of regeneration, and faith as the way of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When man receives regeneration, there may not be a particular feeling, but in his daily life spontaneously there will be a change in his conduct and a renewing of his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the work of God, not the ability of man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who do not have the birth of God from above will continue to be earthly as the children of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word in John 20:17 puts our relationship with God as the Father in the Lord Jesus Christ: "My Father and your Father."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God becomes our Father in the Lord Jesus; those who are not in the Lord Jesus by faith can never be the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life" 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do not accept the only begotten Son of God, you cannot become the child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the children are accepted by God in His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whoever believes in the Lord Jesus Christ will become a child of God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have received the sonship through Him Eph 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Outside of Christ, God is not man's Father, but man's Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Christ, God is man's Father, because on the cross Christ has already been judged by God on behalf of those who are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the gospel of grace, the way by which all men are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The salvation of the Lord Jesus is now accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whoever is willing to believe in His name, that is, whoever is willing to accept Him, will become a child of God; those who are not willing are "the tares which are the sons of the evil one;... which at the consummation of the age...are collected and burned up with fire" Matt 13:38-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eternal life or eternal death fully depends on whether or not man will accept God's salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is only one condition for becoming the sons of God, and that is to believe, to receive the Lord Jesus as Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only by trusting in the Lord Jesus on the cross can one become a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not of works, not of conduct, not of oneself, but of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After becoming a son of God, the regenerated life of God within a believer will cause him to grow in grace daily.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way, his manner of life will become more like God's. He will bear more of the likeness of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He will manifest the standard of God's children in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Physically, a child cannot become full-grown overnight; likewise, the children of God cannot arrive at the full stature of Christ immediately after their regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, growth comes gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We who have received grace and have become the children of God should be "perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect" Matt 5:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God requires that His children be perfect even as He is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It will be difficult for people to believe us if we say that we are the children of God the Father and yet are not like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We will lose our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since God the Father treats good and evil men alike, how can we who are His children hate our enemies and not forgive others their sins?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we are born of Him and partake of His nature, we will surely have His compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we are God's children, yet do not love the Lord Jesus whom He loves, we are wayward sons, and do not sympathize with the Father's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>And how can we be His children, if we do not receive the guidance of the Holy Spirit step by step every day?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we claim to have this heavenly relationship, we must bear the heavenly taste in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we are the children of God and are born from above, everything about us must differ greatly from those who have not been born again.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we claim that we are heavenly, yet we are not much different from the worldly people, we are indeed degrading the Bible's teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No matter what kind of life or environment they are in, the children of God must bear the taste of the heavenly family.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is because a heavenly life cannot be without a heavenly manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is most pitiful that the children of God have now largely lost their characteristics and have compromised with the world in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The reason for a lack in power is that the boundary between the saints and the world has become unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, "as children of obedience, do not be fashioned according to the former lusts in your ignorance; but according to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also be holy in all your manner of life....And if you call as Father the One who without respect of persons judges according to each one's work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear" 1 Pet 1:14-15, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Since we have such a Father, we must not only manifest the nature of our heavenly Father in our living, but we must also live in this world as those who have a Father, not anxious as orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Concerning our clothing, food, and other necessities, we must fully trust in the Lord, because the Father has a tender loving care toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord Jesus comforts us with the words, "your Father knows" Matt 6:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>How wonderful it is to be the children of God!</S>
