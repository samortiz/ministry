<h1 class="title">THE BIRTH, LIVING, AND WORK OF CHRIST<br />
BEING A STORY OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BIBLE BEING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Bible is a mysterious book. On the surface the Bible is plain and easy to understand. Hence, some people regard the Bible as a book of stories. Others, being more thoughtful, consider the Bible to be a book of doctrines. However, if we have the Spirit of God with us, we know deep within that the significance of the Bible is not related to stories or doctrines but to the Spirit.</p>
<p>When people look at me, they first notice the clothes that I am wearing, and if they look more intently, they notice the next layer, my skin and flesh. If there were a way to look deeper, people would see my bones and internal organs. This is the deepest layer that is visible to man. Nevertheless, I am not composed of only these layers. Within me there is something invisible, something that neither medical professionals nor scientists can uncover. This something is my spirit. Within every human being, there is a spirit. If I did not have a spirit, I would be a walking corpse, an absolutely worthless person. I thank the Lord that I have a spirit. The spirit of man is what makes man valuable.</p>
<p>Man has a spirit, and the substance of the Bible is Spirit. The Bible is not of the letter but of the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6). In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; Regrettably, when many people read the Bible, they touch only the words on the surface of the Bible but not the Spirit. Many people know that Jesus was born of the virgin Mary and that He was born in Bethlehem, because they heard this story when they were children. However, there is another story within these Bible stories. This story is spirit and is life. There is not much value in knowing only the stories on the surface. We must see that within the stories there is another story&mdash;spirit and life. Only then is the Bible of value.</p>
<p>The story of Jesus is an extremely mysterious story. For two thousand years historians, theologians, and men of letters have acknowledged the story of Jesus. However, we must know the story within the story of Jesus. The story within the story of Jesus is of the Spirit. The Gospel of Matthew shows not only how Jesus lived, worked, and acted on the earth; it also shows the Spirit within His living, work, and actions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S BIRTH BEING OF THE SPIRIT<br />
AND OUTSIDE RELIGION</h2>
<p>Matthew 1:18 and 20 say, &ldquo;Now the origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, after she had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit...For that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; According to the Gospel of Matthew, the origin of Jesus is a story of the Spirit and is entirely outside religion. Jesus was born in the land of Judea. At the time of His birth, Judaism was a strong religion. Judaism is not a Gentile religion or a heathen practice but an orthodox religion. This religion was established in the Old Testament with a holy temple, altar, priestly system, rituals for offering sacrifices, and ways of worshipping God. These are the items that constitute Judaism as an orthodox religion.</p>
<p>However, the birth of Jesus took place outside religion. God sent an angel, Gabriel, to a young virgin (Luke 1:26-27). Who could imagine such a thing? If we were God, we would send a messenger to the home of a priest in Jerusalem. According to our concept, if Jesus is to be born, He should be born in Jerusalem, in the holy temple, and in the home of a priest. Furthermore, He should be born as a priest. But God is different from us. We have religious concepts and natural concepts, but God does not have any of these. God sent Gabriel to Galilee, an insignificant lower-class province. Gabriel went to a little city called Nazareth in Galilee. He did not go to a wealthy family but to a poor and humble family and even to a weak and fragile virgin. This shows that the birth of Jesus took place outside religion; it was against religious tradition and contrary to cultural regulations. His birth was a story of the Spirit.</p>
<p>It is a pity that Christianity has put Christ into religion and made Him a religious figure. The Jesus we believe in is not a religious figure, nor is He in religion. Where is He? He is in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Christ was born outside religion, outside Jerusalem, outside the holy temple, and outside the priestly system. He was born in the lowly region of Galilee to a poor and humble family in Nazareth through a weak and fragile girl. This is seemingly negative. However, Mary was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit. This was not of religion, tradition, culture, or regulation. It was entirely a story of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:20).</p>
<p>At the time of Christ&rsquo;s birth there were Gentile religions. Now even Christianity has turned into a religion. Christianity has regulations, methods, and doctrines, but it lacks the Spirit. We must see that the age has turned. The Lord desires to turn His church away from religion, doctrines, and regulations and from the law and rituals. He wants the church to turn away from everything outward to the Spirit. The Lord Jesus was not in religion, nor was He a religious figure. The conception and birth of the Lord Jesus was altogether of the Spirit. We did not receive the founder of a religion or a savior in religion. We received the living Christ, who is altogether in the Spirit. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, and His birth was outside religion.</p>
<p>Christ was apparently the same as any other human being, and He had a lowly status. According to the prophecy in the Bible, He was to be born in Bethlehem, but He was conceived in Nazareth. This is wonderful. When the time came for Him to be born, God exercised His mighty hand to arrange the environment to take Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, her days were fulfilled, and the Lord Jesus was born. This fulfilled the prophecies in the Bible. After a short period of time, they left Bethlehem and went down to Egypt, and from Egypt they returned to Nazareth. Nazareth was in a despised region. The Lord grew up in a poor family, and He grew up gradually, just like any other human being. However, within Him there was something different. This something was the Spirit. God does not desire religion, rituals, or doctrines. Neither does He desire spectacular material things, such as buildings. Rather, He desires the inner story of the Spirit. The Lord wants to turn the age. He does not want us to pay attention to religion, rituals, ordinances, methods, regulations, or doctrines. The Lord wants us to pay attention to Him as the living Spirit.</p>
<p>Are our meetings in religion? Do we have ordinances, methods, or regulations in our meetings? God does not want any of these things. God wants us to meet in spirit. Should we be quiet or noisy when we worship God? Some may say that we should be noisy; if this is the case, we have a noisy religion. Others may say that we should be quiet; if this is the case, we have a quiet religion. Saying that we should be quiet is wrong, and saying that we should be noisy is also wrong. Being noisy is of no value, and likewise, being quiet is of no value. We do not want to be quiet, nor do we want to be noisy. We want the Spirit. We do not care for silence or for noise. We care only for the Spirit. If the Spirit is with us, we can be in Nazareth or in Bethlehem. What matters is that we are in the Spirit and that the Spirit is with us.</p>
<p>We need to be delivered from our natural concepts and our religious thoughts. We do not care about outward things. We only care about the Spirit in us. As long as the Spirit of the Lord Jesus is present, it is right even to be in a manger. Today Christ is not concerned with outward things, which are material, visible, religious, systematic, doctrinal, and ritualistic; He is concerned with the Spirit in us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
