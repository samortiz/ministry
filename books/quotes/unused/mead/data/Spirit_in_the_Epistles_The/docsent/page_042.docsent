   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE REVELATION THE REVEALING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was in spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rev 1:10</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Immediately I was in spirit; and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne there was One sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>4:2</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>17:1, 3</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>21:9-10</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please pay attention to the fact that the four passages quoted above all say the writer was "in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must know that the visions or revelations in the book of Revelation are shown in these four times of being "in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first time the apostle John was in spirit he saw the seven golden lampstands and the Lord who walks in the midst of them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the vision in the first three chapters of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second time, he saw a throne in heaven out of which the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls were executed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the vision of the throne, which is in chapters four through sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The third time, he saw Babylon the harlot, which is in chapters seventeen and eighteen and which includes also chapters nineteen and twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fourth time, he saw the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation can be divided into four sections, covering four great visions, all of which were seen by John in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, today if we want to understand these four visions in Revelation, we cannot merely read about them in our mind; instead, we must exercise to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Revelation you see that the indwelling Spirit is the revealing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE SPEAKING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To the messenger of the church in Ephesus write: These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2:1, 7a</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Each of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 begins by saying that it is the Lord who speaks and ends by saying that everyone who has an ear should hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This tells us that the Lord's speaking is the Spirit's speaking, and it also tells us that whatever the Lord speaks must be spoken again by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the beginning of each of the seven epistles it is the Lord speaking to a particular church, but at the end it is the Spirit speaking to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord's word at the beginning is to a certain local church, but later when the people from all the ages read it, it becomes the Spirit's speaking to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever the Lord speaks is recorded in the Bible, but when you and I read it, the Spirit still must speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Spirit refers to the Spirit who is mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This matter proves firstly that the Lord's speaking is the Spirit's speaking and that the Spirit's speaking is the Lord's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Secondly, it proves that although the Lord's word was already spoken to a certain local church, today when the churches want to hear His word, there is still the need for the Spirit to speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This tells us that the Spirit we have within us is not only the revealing Spirit, the vision-imparting Spirit, but also the speaking Spirit.</S>
