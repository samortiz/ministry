   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The New Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 "And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him Christ who created him; where in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all men and in all men " Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just as all of mankind is a corporate old man created in Adam, the church is also a corporate new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ, having abolished on the cross all the ordinances which caused discord among men, created this new man in Himself Eph 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This new man bears the image of its Creator, Christ, who is its life and its content.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this new man, there are no persons of the old creation belonging to any race, religion, culture, or class.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only Christ is all the constituents of this new man and is in all its constituents.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church as the Body of Christ takes Christ as its life for His expression; the church as the new man takes Christ as its person for the fulfillment of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 "The church of God those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints" 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is constituted with all those who have believed into Christ and who possess His life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Any person who has not believed into Christ and has not been saved cannot become a constituent of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without being saved, even our closest relatives are not constituents of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only after they are saved and have the Lord's life to become saints are they constituents of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH A. The Universal Aspect</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1 "On this rock I Christ will build My church" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church mentioned by the Lord in this verse is in the universal aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is unique, including all who have believed into Him in the universe through all the ages and in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>B. The Local Aspect</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1 "If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church" Matt 18:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church mentioned by the Lord in this verse is in the local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is numerous and its local believers can speak to it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the local aspect, the church appears in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Each local church includes only those who have believed into Christ in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE DESIGNATION OF THE CHURCH A. It Has No Special Name</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church is unique and has no need of special names.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is the church; there should not be kinds of churches that are denominated according to their kind, such as the Presbyterian church, the Lutheran church, and the Baptist church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To denominate the church in this way is needless and not according to the biblical revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. It May Be Designated by the Name of Its Locality</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the church is unique in the universe, it is numerous in its local manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The many local churches do not differ in nature; their difference is only in the different places where they are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we may use the name of the locality in which a local church is to designate that church, such as the church in Jerusalem Acts 8:1 , the church in Antioch Acts 13:1 , and the seven local churches in the province of Asia Rev 1:4, 11 .</S>
