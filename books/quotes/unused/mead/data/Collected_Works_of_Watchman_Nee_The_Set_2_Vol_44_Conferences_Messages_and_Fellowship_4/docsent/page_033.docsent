   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THREE THE ORDER OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Rom 12:3-8; Eph 4:9-16; Col 2:19; 1 Cor 11:29 THE MINISTRY OF THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 12:18 says, "But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This shows that every member has a definite place, definite assignment, and definite position.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every member has a particular portion with which he serves the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The eyes see, the ears hear, and the nose smells.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Each organ has its function, and each has its portion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The eyes serve the body by seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ears serve the body by hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The nose serves the body by smelling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Each has its own responsibility, and none can replace another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Member A cannot be member B, and member B cannot be member C. Each member has his own characteristics, and each has his own capability.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These characteristics and capabilities constitute the place, position, or ministry of each member.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The characteristics of a member are the ministry of that member, which is the supply it renders to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ministry of a member dictates his place and position in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The portion of each member in the Body is not for himself, but for the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our service in the Body of Christ is based on what we have received particularly from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The particular knowledge and experience we have acquired from the Lord become our supply to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet many Christians have acquired only reeds amounting to nothing but knowledge that they have heard and doctrines that they have studied.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are reed weapons; they are not the sword of the Spirit, and they will prove to be useless in time of need.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One theologian despised his wife for not knowing the Bible, but when his son became ill, he could not remain calm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His wife, who had a much deeper knowledge of God, was more trusting, peaceful, and firm in her faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Doctrines that are gained from study do not avail much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only the life that comes from the Lord counts, and only that supplies the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>FUNCTIONING IN ORDER</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We supply the Body with the life that we have received from Christ the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet when we function, we have to be proper and in order.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Order in the Body is essential to growth and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the physical body, any dislocation or disproportionate growth of the members hinders its functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is also true in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the meeting no one will stop you from speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But you have to speak according to your measure of faith and according to the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have to know whether there is any overstepping in your speaking, and you have to know whether your speaking is too long.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many believers crave to be outstanding Christians and outstanding workers, but if some become overdeveloped, others will be underdeveloped.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The result would not be the Body but a monstrosity; God's order in the church would be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we truly come under the authority of the Head, He sets us in our special place in the Body and appoints us to our special function.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the denominational organizations, leaders are selected according to background, social status, education, knowledge, intelligence, eloquence, or talent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But they may not have any revelation, faith, or experience in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They can only bring natural things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They will not supply the Body; on the contrary, they will bring death to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ministry of the Body is not determined by natural things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A member functions in the Body according to what he has received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is according to the "measure of faith" Rom 12:3, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the same time, it is according to God's assigned order.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we have to seek revelation and experience from Christ so that we can have something to supply the Body, and we have to know the order of the Body, which is God's assigned pattern in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must be willing to be limited to our measure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As soon as we go beyond it, we go beyond the authority of the Head and move out from under the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we go beyond our measure, we interfere with the order of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Body of Christ is an organic life; it operates without any human arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the members must receive life from the Head and function in proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If our relationship with the Head is proper, we will keep our place in the Body spontaneously.</S>
