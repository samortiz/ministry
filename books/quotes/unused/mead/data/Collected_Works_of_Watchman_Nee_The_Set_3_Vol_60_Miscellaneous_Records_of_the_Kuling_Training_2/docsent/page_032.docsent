   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO CREATE IN MAN A SENSE OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another way to preach the gospel is to create a sense of sin in man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to consider a few ways to preach about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the Power of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man's consciousness of sin grows; it develops gradually from a shallow state to an acute state.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order for our preaching to create a sense of sin in an unbeliever, we have to show him the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is very easy to show an unbeliever the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should ask the following questions: "Do you ever make a resolution to be good?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Does a student ever make a resolution to study well?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Does a child ever make a resolution to not provoke his parents to anger?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Does a wife ever make a resolution to be one with her husband?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The will is present in them, but the power to do it is not Rom 7:18 ."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can ask young people who are addicted to gambling, opium, cigarettes, or alcohol if they want to be free from their habits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to show them that there is a power behind these things that binds them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more a man tries to free himself from this power, the more bound he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is like a high jump athlete; the higher he tries to jump, the more he feels the force of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more a person tries to stop lying, the more he realizes the impossibility of stopping.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more a man resolves to not lose his temper, the more he realizes how hard this is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more a person tries to not sin, the more he discovers the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more he wants to be free from sin, the more he sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way he discovers how great the power of sin is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is exceedingly hard to do good, yet it is exceedingly easy to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, if a man has the life of Christ, he receives a power to do good and a power to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many people are saved through this kind of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once a man knows the power of sin, he develops a consciousness of sin and senses the need for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning the Contagiousness of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people have a strong sense of social responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are not conscious of their own sins, but they react strongly to others' sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They abhor the sins of others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to tell them that when they sin, they damage those who are around them, in particular, their children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every generation follows the pattern of the generation that precedes it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we sin, the next generation will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we smoke opium, our children will be addicted to opium.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we play mahjong, our children will learn to play mahjong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we drink, our children will also drink.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By not suppressing our own sense of sin, we pass this sin on to our children.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are greedy for money or lose our temper easily, others, especially our children, will easily follow in the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although not many people will respond to this kind of preaching, some will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can tell them that sin is contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is especially contagious to our children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can destroy them by our contagion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Concerning the Result of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The one who is damaged the most by sin is the sinner himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sin has fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The wages of sin is death Rom 6:23a .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Proverbs 8:36 says that those who sin against the Lord wrong their own soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a man sins, he reaps the fruit of sin to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Galatians 6:8 says that he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not think that we can get away with sin without reaping some fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The wages of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This verse has saved many people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sin will reap the fruit of sin for the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The result of sin will always fall back on the sinner himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some people have to be brought to this realization before they see the evil of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In describing this fact, we have to read the list of sins spoken of in Romans 1:29-31 and explain these sins one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is like painting a portrait of a person; we have to bring out the true likeness of the man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everyone likes to see a picture of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A gospel preacher has to sketch a picture of man and show him his true likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we describe a man's sins one by one, the Holy Spirit will shine on him and convict him of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Quite a number of people become conscious of their sins through this kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we can preach in this way, others will know that they are short.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to speak about sin, however, we must live in God's presence and be under the light ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must receive the shining ourselves before we can enlighten others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once a man sees the dominion sin has over him, his heart will turn, and he will seek for the Savior.</S>
