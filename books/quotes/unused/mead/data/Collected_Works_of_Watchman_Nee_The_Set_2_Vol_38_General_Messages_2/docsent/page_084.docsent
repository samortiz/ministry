   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SUBMISSION OF THE WIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BRINGING IN BLESSING TO THE FAMILY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The husband's demands on the wife are not always that pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once I was a guest at a brother's house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was a constant difference of opinion in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One person wanted to do one thing, and the other person wanted to do another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the wife in the house was very submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although there were differences in opinion, she was very submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although she did not follow her husband's opinion, she was still very submissive and gentle in her attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She said to her husband in a very gentle way, "I cannot do this."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although she did not obey, she was very gentle in her attitude, and the family was a very harmonious one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The cushion of a family is the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The floor beneath us does not make any noise because the carpet cushions it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cushion of a family is the gentleness of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once we have such a cushion, there will not be much noise in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is true that an unsaved husband may not allow you to be baptized or bind up your hair.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But sisters, when you have a husband that does not allow you to do these things, what attitude will you take?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Will you say in your heart that you wish you could obey his word but that you cannot?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I can tell you honestly that after being a Christian for many years, I have often failed to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet God disciplines me and shows me something, and I still fear my God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have not succeeded in doing many things, but I still fear God; I am still fearful before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I wish I could obey.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course it is another thing when God makes us able to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I say this to show you God's demand for us today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is one element that will keep a family in peace: submission in the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>LOVE IN THE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, the brothers have to love; they have to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 25 is after verse 24.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a family, after the wife submits, the demand is on the husband to love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A husband's love is something active; it is manifested in making provisions for many things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not a passive love but an active love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The husband has to actively assume the headship in the family; he has to make arrangements and provisions, provide protection, and take up the responsibility in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The ugliest thing in this world is finding a wife who is not submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is also very ugly finding a husband who does not know how to be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>MAINTAINING THE POSITION THAT GOD HAS ORDAINED</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During these days, two or three brothers have come to me to ask about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I said that there are four kinds of marriages in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only one of the four is good; the other three are bad.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first kind is for a man to marry a woman, that is, for a proper man to marry a proper woman.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the best kind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second kind is not as good, which is for a "woman" to marry a woman, that is, for a submissive man to marry a submissive woman.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The third kind is for a man to marry a "man," that is, for a responsible man to marry a responsible woman.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fourth kind is for a submissive man to be married to a responsible woman; it will end up being a terrible family.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a family is hopeless; nothing can be worse than this kind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I thank the Lord that God's ordination is always wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He ordains a man to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The man has to love and actively take up the responsibility of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has to make arrangements for everything in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God loves to see a man be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He hates to see a man looking like a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The woman should submit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God wants the woman to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Submission is in a woman's nature; it is the woman's nature to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brother Yang, you can never say to your wife, "Why can't I do what you can do?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You can say this anywhere else, but you cannot say this in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You can never say to your wife, "Why can't I do what you can do?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have to remember that you cannot do what she can do.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Similarly, she cannot do what you can do.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A wife cannot say to the husband, "Why can't I do what you can do?", and the husband cannot say this to the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you can do what your wife can do, you have become a woman already, and you have not stood on the position that God has ordained for you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A wife cannot say this to her husband, and a husband cannot say this to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May the Lord bless our brother and our sister and show them their responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You may say, "If I had known that it would be that troublesome, I would not have come this far."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is why I told you earlier that you cannot have a family unless you are spiritual; you will not be able to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many people think that it is a simple thing to have a family.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But I must tell you that a family will be an acid test to you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It will show what you can and cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May the Lord bless our brother so that he can love his wife and take up his responsibility to protect, arrange, provide, supply, and be the head of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At the same time, may the Lord bless our sister so that she can become a genuine wife and submit in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we all do this, many of the problems in our families will be eliminated, and many blessings will be ushered in.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>DEALING WITH THE DIFFERENCES</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>BETWEEN THE HUSBAND AND THE WIFE</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There is one final word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today is the first day for you to begin to deal with your problems together.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do not misunderstand, this is not the first day for you to take a nice walk in the park.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you learn your lesson well, perhaps in five years you will have a wonderful family.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What is a honeymoon?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A honeymoon is the beginning of days of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When will you begin to have some sweet days?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you deal with the differences between the husband and the wife properly, you may have sweet days after five years.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But you have to begin to learn before you can expect those days to come.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You have to put in some effort before you learn.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Once again, may the Lord bless the two of you and pour down His blessings upon you, and may you be dealt with and learn your lessons day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>May the Lord bless both of you.</S>
