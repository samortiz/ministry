   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Avoiding Inappropriate Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we visit the dormant saints, we must avoid inappropriate speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, we should not say, We are visiting you because you have not been to a meeting for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since the one we are visiting will have some sense of shame related to not being in the meetings, there is no need to remind him of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no need to expose weaknesses or faults.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must look upon these saints as being without any blemish Eph 5:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To speak of such matters is inappropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We also must avoid using words that give them a sense of being pressured.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must not urge them to come back to the meeting or chastise them for not being in the meetings, saying, It is not good to miss the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do not meet, you will miss out on the blessing in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such words are inappropriate and should be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not expose people s weaknesses or tell them that they must come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even when we give a testimony of how we have been blessed, we can inadvertently imply that they are not blessed, and if we speak of how we have been richly supplied by attending all the meetings, they may only be reminded that they have not attended any meetings recently.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of speaking should be avoided altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A testimony should not be a pretext to preach, to beat, or even to chastise the dormant saints for not loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Someone who has not been in a meeting for a long time is very sensitive; he may have many feelings that cause him to be suspicious and overly sensitive; thus, it is easy for him to misinterpret our words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Visiting people is not easy, and we must pay attention to a person s condition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we visit a dormant brother or sister, we must not speak carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Visiting such ones is like skating on thin ice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are a little careless, we may fall through the ice and damage them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we must not speak in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need a joyful face, and we should give them no reason to feel any pressure or anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even saying, I am really concerned for you, will only make some secretly wonder whether our concern is only based on their weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Careless words will cause psychological reactions, and they must be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Having a Joyful Face</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In principle when we visit people, we must have a smiling face, a face without sorrow or sadness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time, we need to let people speak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not need to say so much; rather, we should join in with what they are speaking, following their topic in sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet even in this, we need wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For instance, a brother may say, I am really ashamed that I have not gone to a meeting for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would not be good to follow by saying, Yes, it is wrong not to meet!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It also may not be good to even say, God still loves you, because this may open a hidden wound.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need much learning and consideration concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we visit the saints, eight out of ten will indicate that they are ashamed about not meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A better way to follow may be to speak of our own experience, saying, Even when I missed meetings in the past, the saints were always happy to see me when I came.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Or if we have had contact with him in the past, we could say, That does not matter, I really missed you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need much practice because a person who has not met for a while is very sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a very crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some have suggested that we should pray with a brother or sister who has not been meeting for a while, but we should not be too quick in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the matter of visiting, we must hold firm to one principle: We should be careful about the things we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>More than speaking, we just need to smile because of our joy in seeing them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will spontaneously draw them close to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I was born in Christianity, and I went to Christian schools, but by the time I was sixteen, I began to despise Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It seemed as if the Bible did not teach anything better than Confucius teachings, so I did not see why we needed Western teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The reputation of some pastors and evangelists also was not very good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, by the time I reached the age of sixteen, I felt that Christianity was not very meaningful, so I stopped attending Sunday services.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even though my mother was not saved, she was zealous for Christianity, but she could not make me go to the Sunday services.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During this period of time, the Lord s mercy was surely very marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My second sister, due to the sudden passing away of her fianc , was willing to consecrate herself to study in a distinguished seminary in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before leaving home, she entrusted me to the care of a Chinese pastor named Yu.</S>
