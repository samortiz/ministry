   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 14 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rev 21:2 And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God...</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Heb 12:22 But you have come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem...</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Jerusalem Its Designations The New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the designations of the New Jerusalem imply its constituents, elements, composition, and constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why it is important for us to find out the significances of all these designations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>281</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why does the Spirit use the word new in the designation New Jerusalem ?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible reveals to us two creations the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is nothing of God s nature involved with any item in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, God is not in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In everything of the new creation, however, God s divine nature is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The old man has nothing of God in it, but the new man is not only born of God but also created and constituted with God John 1:12-13; 2 Cor 5:17; Col 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The old Jerusalem was a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In its constituents there was nothing of God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the New Jerusalem, just like the new man, has God wrought into it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is new because God has been added in. Anything that is without God is old, but anything in which God is added is new.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>282</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The title Jerusalem is composed of two Hebrew words Jeru means foundation and Salem means peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul tells us in Hebrews 7 that the king of Salem is the king of Peace v. 2 . Salem is peace and Jeru is something founded, something built, something laid as a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, Jerusalem means the foundation of peace....The Bible indicates that peace is God Himself Phil 4:7, 9; 1 Thes 5:23 ....When we consummate in the New Jerusalem we will be in peace, that is, in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>283</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Holy City</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The New Jerusalem is the holy city Rev 21:2, 10 ....In the New Testament the word holy means not only separated unto God but also saturated with God, whereas in the Old Testament to be made holy is only to be separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no saturation of God in the Old Testament, and the holiness, or sanctification, there is only positional, not dispositional.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament, however, we see both objective, positional sanctification and subjective, dispositional sanctification Matt 23:17, 19; Rom 6:19, 22; 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In positional sanctification there is only a change of position, but in dispositional sanctification there is the transformation in nature and in element....Based upon this principle, we can see that the holy city, the New Jerusalem, cannot be a physical city since a physical city cannot be saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Jerusalem is a city composed of living persons who have been separated unto God and saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>284</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The City of the Living God, the Heavenly Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hebrews 11:14-16 reveals that the Old Testament saints longed after a better country, a heavenly country, and that God has prepared for them a city.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 12:22, however, the writer tells us that we have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse does not say that we will come to the heavenly Jerusalem but that we have come to this city.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the Mount Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem in 12:22 were material, how could we have come to them today?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This would be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fact that, according to Hebrews 12:22, we have already come to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, indicates that it is not a material city.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christians are waiting to go to the New Jerusalem, but we need to realize that we have come to the New Jerusalem already.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is the house of the living God 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the church is God s home, and it is also our home today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the church is enlarged to be a city, it becomes a heavenly country.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our heavenly country is a city the heavenly Jerusalem to which we have already come.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>285</S>
