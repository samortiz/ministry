   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S PURPOSE IN JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The common understanding of justification among most Christians is this: we are sinful, God is righteous and holy, and there is no way for us to contact Him or for Him to contact us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, Christ died on the cross and accomplished redemption by shedding His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Under His blood we are redeemed, and God has a righteous position to justify us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of this is absolutely correct.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Apostle Paul did not conclude the section on justification at this point, which is reached at the end of chapter 3.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I studied the book of Romans as a young Christian, I thought that chapter 4 was unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It seemed to me that justification had been completely covered at the end of chapter 3, that chapter 5 should have been connected to chapter 3, and that chapter 4 should have been eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later I realized that the Apostle Paul was not that superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His concern was deeper than redemption he cared about God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Redemption is not God s purpose; it is a process to reach God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Romans 3 we see redemption bringing forth God s justification, but we do not see God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What was God s purpose in justification?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In answering this question, Paul used Abraham s history as an example, as a picture to explain what no human words can explain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we study the picture in chapter 4, we will realize that it is deeper, more profound, and more far-reaching than chapter 3.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We thought that justification was merely a matter related to sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, when we read Genesis 15 where Abraham s faith was reckoned by God as righteousness, we find no mention of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sin was not involved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The concern was over a seed which would become a kingdom for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Abraham was not called out by God simply because God had mercy on his sinful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God did not say, Abraham, you are so pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do not want you to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In My mercy I come to call you out of your fallen state.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That was not the issue at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Genesis 1 we are told that God made man in His own image to express Himself and that this man was a corporate man, not an individual man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God created a corporate man that included both male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Genesis 5:2, both Adam and Eve are called Adam, signifying that God created a corporate man to express Him and exercise His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, God wanted to have a kingdom as a sphere in which to express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although this was God s purpose, man fell away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once man had turned away from God, had been distracted from God s purpose, and had been occupied with other things, he fell deeply into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, the involvement in Genesis 15 is not sin, but how God s purpose can be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not a question of being saved, but of accomplishing God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as you are involved in the fulfillment of God s purpose, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christianity is superficial, concerning itself with the salvation of man, not with the purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s justification is not primarily for man s salvation; it is for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why has God chosen you?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He did not choose you primarily for salvation, He chose you for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why has God called you?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has not called you for heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He has called you for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as you are involved with God s purpose, your salvation is secure.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, if you only care for your salvation, you may miss the mark of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Salvation is not an end in itself; it is for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, God s justification is for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no mention of sin in Genesis 15.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God told Abraham, Look at the heavens and count the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Your seed will be like the stars in the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Abraham believed, and his faith was counted by God as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God s justification of Abraham was unrelated to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was totally involved with God s purpose, with having a seed to produce a kingdom for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is why the Apostle Paul in Romans 4, after referring to Genesis 15 where Abraham s faith was reckoned as righteousness, mentions the promise given to Abraham and his seed of inheriting the world 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What does inheriting the world have to do with justification?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why does Paul mention this in chapter 4?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Abraham and his heirs must inherit the world for the sake of God s kingdom, and God s kingdom is for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Romans 4 tells us that God s justification is not for going to heaven or merely for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Justification enables Abraham and all his believing heirs to inherit the world and to exercise the dominion of God on this earth as mentioned in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we only had Romans 3, we would say that God s justification, based upon Christ s redemption, is for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Chapter 4, however, clearly unveils that God s justification of His chosen ones is not merely for their salvation; it is purposely for them to inherit the world that they may exercise God s dominion on the earth.</S>
