   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Concerning Sidon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord prophesied in Ezekiel 28:22-23, Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sidon was surrounded by the Persian army in 35 B.C., and forty thousand inhabitants chose to die rather than to surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They burned their own houses and died in the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hundreds of years later, Sidon was caught in the middle of a struggle between the Crusaders and the Muslims.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She was also the battleground in the conflicts between the Druses and the Turks and between Turkey and France.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1840, she was bombarded by the armies of England, France, and Turkey.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sidon has historically been a war-torn city; thus, the prophecy in Ezekiel was fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Sidon was only fifty miles from Tyre, its treatment was different.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Tyre was completely eliminated from the face of the earth; yet, after passing through much affliction, as prophesied, Sidon still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only God could have predicted that two such similar cities would have such dissimilar fates.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This, again, is strong proof that the Bible is divinely inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>E. Concerning Babylon</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord prophesied in Isaiah 13:19-22, And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, the glory of the Chaldeans majesty, will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah: it will no more be inhabited forever; it will not be dwelt in from generation to generation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And the Arab will not set up his tent there, nor will the shepherd make his flocks lie down there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But desert animals will lie down there, and their houses will be full of wild dogs; there ostriches will dwell, and wild goats will prance there; hyenas will respond in their citadels, and jackals in their exquisite palaces.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Her time is about to come, and her days will not be prolonged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This prophecy was fulfilled soon after it was spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The limited space of this lesson does not allow us to enumerate the many biblical prophecies which have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are also many unfulfilled prophecies that remain to be fulfilled one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God s word will not pass away until every one is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE PROOF BY ITS POWER</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no other book on earth that can positively change people as dramatically as the Bible can.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Scientific books cannot improve a person s disposition; on the contrary, some scientific advancements, such as the manufacture of modern weaponry, make it easier to destroy rather than improve humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Language books, instead of uplifting the readers character, may just make them proud.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only the Bible dispositionally changes people in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A. In Gospel Preaching</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible exhorts Christians to disciple all nations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The gospel needs to be preached to the uttermost parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many Christians defy all odds to fulfill this commission.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christians have brought the gospel from Jerusalem, to Judea, to Samaria, to Asia Minor, to Europe, to Africa, to America, to Asia, and to remote islands.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Wherever the gospel went, the broken-hearted were healed, drunkards became sober, prodigal sons and daughters returned home, and evil people turned to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some did not regard their lives and were martyred for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What other book has such power to affect the lives of men?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>B. In Changing Behavior</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One time, an American merchant in Africa saw a native reading a Bible under a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said to the native, This book is not popular in America.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not worth anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The native pointed to his stomach and said, If it were not because of this book, you would be in here by now.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The native had been a cannibal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>C. In Sensitizing the Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Another time, a person believed in the Lord after hearing the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later in the day, he stole a bun and ate it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That night, he felt so bad that he could not sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The next day, he came back to the brother who had preached to him and said, I did not get saved yesterday, because I stole something.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The brother said, Before you received the Lord, did you feel bad when you stole?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The new believer said, Before I received the Lord, the more I stole, the better I could sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then the brother said, You are really saved, because the Lord in you bothered you when you stole.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You need to repent to the Lord and to the store owner.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These are only a few of the millions of stories of people who have been changed by the gospel in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible has the power to change people s lives.</S>
