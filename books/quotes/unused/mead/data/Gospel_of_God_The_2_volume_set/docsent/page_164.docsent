   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S GRACE AND LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have previously mentioned what grace is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All of the readers of the New Testament know that we are saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one would be so incorrect as to say that salvation is by the law and not by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a man says that a person is saved by the law and not by grace, he has never read the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This light is too great in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some things we can let go of easily.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we cannot let this matter go by in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If salvation is by grace, then we can never be a debtor before God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I show grace to others, I cannot expect any repayment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I had any thought of repayment, and if I had any hope of being repaid, this would be a loan and not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I give something to you with the hope that one day you will return it, this is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God gives us grace today with the hope that we will render good works to Him later, it is not grace either.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is absolutely no return regarding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What does the Bible say about the way to receive eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Rom 6:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the eternal life that we have received cannot be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is a gift?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A gift is a present from God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is something that God gives to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If others give something to us, can they ask for it back?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not kindergarten children, giving others some candy one day and asking for it in return the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A gift is something given freely.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If our salvation could be lost, Romans 6:23 would have to say, "The loan of God is eternal life in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A loan can be reclaimed, but something that is given cannot be reclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once it is given, it is given forever.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If eternal life is given to us in Christ, then it can never be reclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word gift in the original language clearly indicates that it is something given freely; it cannot be reclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If it cannot be reclaimed, then there is no possibility of us losing the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible shows us clearly that God's gift is without repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eternal life is an important item of God's gift.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Salvation is also an important item of God's gift.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are many other items besides these.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's gift is given without repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there is no repentance, how can God reclaim it?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to reclaim it, there must first be regret.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without any regret, there can never be any reclaiming.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the same time, if there is any reclaiming, it is no longer a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With giving, there is no such thing as reclaiming.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Can I say that I am giving something and then claim it back again tomorrow?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I cannot do that.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If it is given, it cannot be reclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is not like us, wavering and changing frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is not one way today and another way the next.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once God has given us something, He will never claim it back.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As far as God's character is concerned, salvation is given to us as a gift rather than as a loan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, we have to admit that it is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thank and praise the Lord that God never borrows and never lends.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He never expects repayment; He only gives.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not only does He never borrow or lend, He never sells either.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God saves us by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is so great that He cannot sell, borrow, or lend anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is so great that He can only give away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, we see that the gift of God is eternal life.</S>
