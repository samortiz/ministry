   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ as the Chief Cornerstone</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Coming in the Name of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalms 118:26a declares, "Blessed is He who comes in the name of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that Christ will come in the name of God, in the name of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In fact, He will come two times in the name of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>a. The First Time</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first time is mentioned in Matthew 21:5-11.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That was the time when Christ was warmly welcomed by the people in Jerusalem who said, "Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!" v. 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Second Time</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Christ came in the name of Jehovah the first time, He was rejected by the Jews, and today they still will not welcome Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, when He comes back, the Jews will give Him a warm welcome and say, "Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord" Matt 23:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus quoted Psalm 118 in Matthew 21:42 and in 23:39, each time applying the words of the psalm to Himself and thereby interpreting them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without His interpretation, we could not understand that the cornerstone in Psalm 118:22 refers to Christ and that the word in verse 26 about "He who comes in the name of Jehovah" also refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Psalmists Blessing Israel with All the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>from the Praising House of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Finally, Psalm 118:26b says, "We bless you from the house of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we have the psalmists blessing Israel with all the nations from the praising house of Jehovah.</S>
