   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HURT OF THE SECOND DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are similar passages in the Bible that speak of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 2:11 tells us that those who overcome will not be hurt by the second death, and Revelation 20:6 says that one group of people will not die again and that the second death will not have authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second death is the lake of fire at the end of Revelation 20.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that the defeated ones will suffer the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although they will not suffer the second death itself, they will suffer the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once a person is saved, he will not suffer the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But this does not guarantee that he will not suffer the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know that the time of the lake of fire and brimstone is the time when the new heaven and the new earth begins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan, the world, and death will all be cast into the lake of fire at that time Rev 20:10, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also at that time a man will be cast into the lake of fire if his name is not recorded in the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That will be the time when unbelievers are officially put into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, during the millennium, the defeated Christians will suffer the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, this dealing will not be like the dealing that the unbelievers will have; it is not for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a Christian is joined to the world and if he loves the world and the things of the world, the Lord will allow him to go into corruption, to suffer a little of what the unbelievers will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is what being hurt by the second death in Revelation 2 means, and this word is spoken to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word "hurt" in the original language means to injure someone and to damage him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second death will cause pain for some.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the time of the great white throne on, there is the second death itself, which is the suffering for eternity in the lake of fire and of brimstone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the millennium there is only the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If some Christians have not dealt with their sins, they will still suffer the hurt and pain of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE END BEING TO BE BURNED</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us now read two passages from the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hebrews 6:4-6 says, "For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and yet have fallen away, to renew themselves again unto repentance."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These verses describe a person who has many qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is impossible for him to be an unsaved person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has seen the light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has seen the revealed God, the Only Begotten of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has known the love of God, and he has tasted the heavenly gift, the unique gift, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Bible, gifts as a plural noun refer to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and gift as a singular noun refers to the unique gift, the only begotten Son of God, as in John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This gift is different from the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This person not only has God and the Lord Jesus, but has also become a partaker of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He knows God, he has tasted the Lord Jesus, and he has the Holy Spirit living within him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, he has tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The powers of the coming age are the powers of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The gifts and powers of the Holy Spirit are particularly abundant in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The millennial kingdom will be full of works of power, miracles, wonders, and other such things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To say that one has tasted the powers of the coming age is to say that one has tasted the things of the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, this person is definitely a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If such a person leaves the word of the beginning of Christ today and slips and falls, there is no repentance for him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He cannot start all over again to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has too much history with the Lord already.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He has received so much rain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He has fallen and does not bring forth good things for God, but has brought forth thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He, like "the earth, which drinks the rain which often comes upon it and brings forth vegetation suitable to those for whose sake also it is cultivated, partakes of blessing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if it brings forth thorns and thistles, it is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Notice three things about such a person and his end. First, he is disapproved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The word "disapproved" here is the same word as that used in 1 Corinthians 9:27 where Paul said that he feared that though he had preached the gospel to others, he himself would be rejected and would not be used by God anymore in this age and in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be disapproved, to be rejected, means that God will reject such a one and will not use him anymore in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Second, such a person is "near a curse."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The verse does not say that he will receive a curse, but the punishment that he receives is similar to a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He will not perish forever, but he will suffer the hurt of the second death and will suffer the Gehenna of fire in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Third, his "end is to be burned."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For example, a few weeks ago, I intended to burn up some land in Jen-ru.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Could I burn the land forever?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Could I burn the land for even five years?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The burning here refers to something temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Here it speaks about burning, whereas Matthew 5 says that some will be liable to the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you put these two passages together, they match each other.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a Christian receives all these wonderful things but does not bear good fruit to God, but rather thorns and thistles, he will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However this burning will only be for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even an elementary school boy knows that if you burn a piece of land, the burning will stop after all the thorns are burned up.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The burning in the kingdom will go on at most for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How long it will actually burn depends on you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you have brought forth many thorns and thistles, then there will be more burning.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you have brought forth few thorns and thistles, then there will be less burning.</S>
