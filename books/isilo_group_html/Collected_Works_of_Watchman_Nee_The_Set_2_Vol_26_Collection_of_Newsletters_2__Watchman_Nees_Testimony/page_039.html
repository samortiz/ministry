I am both fearful and sober! The sound of the battle is close. Although the battle is not yet fierce, my boldness for battle has already vanished. This has caused me to become nervous. I am afraid that I will shame the Lord's name! I do not know what more I can do than to look to Him for these days. Oh, I am so weak and ignorant. I am also in such a solitary, cold, and remote situation. I do not know to what extent I will fail!</p><p>I have gone to a high place a few times and looked out to see the environment around me. It is as if the wind and snow in the wilderness have pierced my skin; I shiver with cold and shake. I look at my inward faith, which is so weak that I have almost been disappointed to the point of retreat. Oh, if His love had not given me a little warm strength and encouragement, I would have fallen into the disqualified crowd long ago. My cry is, "Lord, all else is up to You; just grant me one thing: to hold on and endure to the end of the road so that even if I die it will be in glory!"</p><p>There have been a few times that it seemed as if I had no hope to continue working, so I asked God "not to send me." I never received any answer, however. On the contrary, I felt as if the burden were heavier. So I dare not move loosely. Brother, think about it; this environment is so difficult to bear! What sickness is it?</p><p>It is the same with my prayer. I only feel the "need," but when I kneel down, I "cannot" open my mouth; I can only sigh. It is as if I have the burden to pray, but I do not have the unction to pray. Sometimes I do not even have the burden to pray. What is this? Is it the separation of sin? Is it the attack of the enemy?</p><p>From the time I left Shanghai until now, I have not broken bread once, nor have I prayed with brothers in the way. The brothers I have met have either had their faces toward the world or their hearts toward another spirit. Oh, this condition makes me cry. Although it is possible to remember the Lord alone, it is not as meaningful as when brothers "dwell in unity"! I can say that the former is less than one ten thousandth as meaningful as the latter.</p><p>I returned to Ting Hai this time because my mother is sick. There was a group of so-called Christians who asked me to preach to them. I preached the gospel to them in the beginning. There was much grace, so they felt very satisfied. When the cross gradually became manifested, no one was willing to receive it. It was as if they did not even have the heart to pursue the crown behind the cross. Man's heart is only to receive the blessing, not the Lord who gives it! According to their opinion, "Being spiritual is important, but the flesh is also needed." Oh, what kind of a saying is this? But thank the Lord, those with ears really heard. There was a "pastor" among them who was touched by the Lord in his heart. He saw that his work in the past was just straw and wood. He also saw that we should only honor the Lord. He has set his heart and his will. Now he just desires the time of the Lord's glorious appearing. May the Lord keep him and allow him to realize his desire to go to the conference in Hangchow. He is a brother with a good foundation and talent. He is also the product of Shanghai and Kiangsu.</p><p>When I worship with my mother in Ting Hai, we can only weep. She left the sisters in Shanghai, and if she does not return to Shanghai, she will never (while she's on earth) have the chance to take the cup again. May the Lord's truth prosper in the whole earth so that the unwarranted loneliness and remoteness of His children can be reduced.</p><p>Tomorrow, if the Lord is willing, I will take the 8:15 train to Shaoshing. There I will learn again from the Lord how to give Him the first place in the work and obey Him in all things. After the conference in Shaoshing, I will perhaps go to Hangchow. Maybe I will be able to partake of the table of love.</p><p>May the Lord who loves us protect you in all things. May your spirit, soul, and body be hidden under the blood so that you may not be attacked by the enemy. May the Lord bring the heavenly messages to earth through Christ and His Spirit so that you may have more revelation to tell all your brothers. May the Lord cleanse your mouth and heart so that His all may flow through freely without frustration. I can only exercise my function as a member through prayer to bind and command the enemy.</p><p>Please forgive me for writing so much in a letter without order or politeness. This is a little of what has flowed out from within. We have never spoken much. Hence, there is the need of forgiveness. May you be satisfied in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />David Hsu,<br />The twenty-fourth</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 26: Collection of Newsletters (2) & Watchman Nee's Testimony &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
