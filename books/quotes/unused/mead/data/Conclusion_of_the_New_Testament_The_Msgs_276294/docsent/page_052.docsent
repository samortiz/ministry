   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This proves that even though Cornelius feared God and worked righteousness and his prayers and alms had been accepted by God, he still needed God s forgiveness of his sins through believing into Christ the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although he was devout, he was yet still sinful and could not say that he had not sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, he needed redemption and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ, who is the Judge of the living and the dead, can also be experienced and enjoyed as the Redeemer into whom we may believe to receive forgiveness of sins.</S>
