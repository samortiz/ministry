<p>The second cause of man&rsquo;s second fall was that he followed his own will. After Adam and Eve fell, God revealed His way of salvation to man; hence, man should have communed with God according to His way of salvation. However, Cain rejected God&rsquo;s way of salvation, set aside God&rsquo;s will, and served God according to his own will. Thus, man fell once more.</p>
<p>The second cause of man&rsquo;s first fall was that he assumed the headship. The second cause of man&rsquo;s second fall was that he followed his own will. Assuming the headship is very close to following one&rsquo;s own will. For man to assume the headship is for him to set God aside; for man to follow his own will is for him to set God&rsquo;s will aside. When man sets God aside, man comes forth, and when man sets God&rsquo;s will aside, man&rsquo;s will comes forth.</p>
<p>Man fell when he followed his own will, because Satan was in man, mixed with man&rsquo;s fallen will. The element of Satan was one with man&rsquo;s fallen will. Therefore, for man to follow his own will was for him to follow Satan and to be gained by Satan. For this reason, the Lord Jesus spoke of our need to deny ourselves (Matt. 16:23-24). As soon as we follow our own will, we are following Satan. As fallen men, we do not need to be tempted by Satan in order to fall. As soon as we follow our own fallen will, we will fall further.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Process of Man&rsquo;s Second Fall</h2>
<p>We will now consider the process of man&rsquo;s second fall.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Presenting an Offering to God<br />
according to the Human Will&mdash;<br />
Serving God according to a Religion<br />
Based on the Human Will</h2>
<p>First, Cain&rsquo;s offering to God was according to his own will. He was serving God according to a religion based on the human will. &ldquo;In the course of time Cain brought an offering to Jehovah from the fruit of the ground. And Abel also brought an offering, from the firstlings of his flock, that is, from their fat portions. And Jehovah had regard for Abel and for his offering. But for Cain and for his offering He had no regard&rdquo; (Gen. 4:3-5). Both Cain and Abel brought an offering to God, but Cain&rsquo;s offering was according to his own will, and Abel&rsquo;s offering was according to God&rsquo;s will. Abel offered a sacrifice according to God&rsquo;s way of salvation, but Cain&rsquo;s service and offering were altogether according to his own view, not according to God&rsquo;s way of salvation.</p>
<p>The fruit of the ground is fruits and vegetables, not meat. According to typology, vegetables refer to human works, and meat refers to Christ&rsquo;s redemption. After man sinned, he could be accepted by God only through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, not through his own works. It was not until man was redeemed by Christ that man could walk in the good works that God had prepared beforehand (Eph. 2:10) as sacrifices that are well pleasing to God (Heb. 13:16). Therefore, in the Old Testament the children of Israel first had to be redeemed by the blood of the passover lamb (Exo. 12:1-30) before they could offer up the fruit of the land (23:19; Lev. 2). Today, anyone who has not been redeemed by Christ but wants to serve and please God with his deeds, like Cain, will not be regarded by God.</p>
<p>Cain&rsquo;s way of offering reveals that he had no consciousness of sin. He did not feel sinful, even though he was sinful before God; rather, he felt that he had something to offer to God. Thus, he offered up the fruit of his labor in order to please God. Such an offering blasphemes God. When a sinner comes before God, he should, like the tax collector in Luke 18 who went up to the temple to pray (v. 13), sense his sins and shortcomings and seek God&rsquo;s mercy so that God can look upon him. He is blaspheming God if, without any consciousness of sin, he proudly presents his works and deeds to God for acceptance. No wonder Cain was rejected by God. Such behavior not only overlooks but also tramples upon God&rsquo;s righteousness. God is righteous. His righteousness cannot allow Him to look upon a sinner who does not sense his sinfulness. Many people, however, are like Cain. They overlook their sins while wanting to please God with their works. As a result, they trample on God&rsquo;s righteousness and are rejected by Him. The Pharisee who went up to the temple to pray in Luke 18 is an example of such a one. He trusted in his righteousness, despised the others, and boasted to God (vv. 9-12). Everyone in Christianity who does not follow God&rsquo;s revelation but instead follows his own will, the human view, and who serves God in the current of the world is imitating Cain; this is to go in the way of Cain (Jude 11).</p>
<p>Cain&rsquo;s service was his religion. This religion was bloodless; it desired to serve God without the shedding of the blood of the sin offering. If man had not fallen or become sinful, he would have had no need for the blood of a sin offering. But because man sinned and is sinful, he needs the blood of the sin offering. Without the shedding of the blood of the sin offering to redeem him, man&rsquo;s sins cannot be forgiven (Heb. 9:22). If man&rsquo;s sins are not forgiven, how can he serve a righteous, holy, and sin-abhorring God? How can he be accepted by such a God? Many people today are like Cain. They serve God according to a bloodless religion. They are sinful, but they do not have the redeeming blood. They want to serve God, but they do not and cannot deal with the sins that God abhors. As a result, they serve God, but they are not accepted by Him.</p>
<p>The religion of Cain is a bloodless religion, and it is also a religion of &ldquo;works&rdquo; (Rom. 3:27). Cain offered up the fruit of the ground, which he obtained by his sweat and toil. He wanted to please God with his deeds. But how can a person who is damaged and defiled by sin have any works that are clean and acceptable to God? How can any of his deeds earn merit before God or redeem him from his sins? Nevertheless, many people are like Cain, depending on their deeds and works to serve God and to be accepted by Him. God will not regard this kind of bloodless service based on works.</p>
<p>Although God instituted a way of salvation for man to draw near to Him, to serve Him, and to be accepted by Him, Satan caused man to serve God according to his own view, not according to God&rsquo;s way of salvation. God created man, but Satan caused man to sin and fall. Then God instituted a way of salvation to rescue man, but Satan caused man to reject God&rsquo;s way of salvation. Because man did not need to sin again in order to fall, Satan did not need to cause Cain to sin; he needed only to prevent Cain from accepting God&rsquo;s way of salvation. This was sufficient to keep Cain in the fall. Satan is so insidious that he does not need to tempt man to sin; he can keep man by causing man to serve God according to his human will. As long as he prevents man from following God&rsquo;s revelation and from accepting God&rsquo;s way of salvation, he can keep man in his fallen condition.</p>
<p>We should not think that only sinning can cause a man to fall but that serving God cannot. Serving God, just like sinning, can cause man to fall if it is done according to man&rsquo;s will. Cain fell because he served God according to his human will. Therefore, it is not a matter of serving God but of following God&rsquo;s will; it is a matter of giving ground to the human will rather than to God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>In man&rsquo;s first fall, man assumed the headship, had the ground, and set God aside. In man&rsquo;s second fall, man&rsquo;s will had the ground, not God&rsquo;s will. According to God&rsquo;s revelation, man cannot serve God according to his own will. If he tries to serve God according to his own will, he will encounter problems. Formerly, we did not serve God but loved the world and lusted after sin. Although it is commendable that we no longer love the world or lust after sin and instead desire to serve God, it is not easy for us to serve God, because we are required to serve God according His will, not according to our own will. This is a great problem.</p>
<p>If we are to serve God, our own will must be dealt with. Whether Satan can gain us does not depend on whether we sin but on whether we live according to our will or according to God&rsquo;s will. As long as we are according to our will, we are living in Satan&rsquo;s hand. Many Christians serve God, but I am afraid that many of them are in Satan&rsquo;s hand because they serve according to their own will. This is a terrible thing.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God's Way of Salvation in Man's Fall &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
