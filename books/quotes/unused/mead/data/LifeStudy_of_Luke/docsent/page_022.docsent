   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SEVEN THE PREPARATION OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMANITY WITH HIS DIVINITY 5 Scripture Reading: Luke 3:1-22</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider the inauguration of the Man-Savior 3:1-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First He was introduced by John the Baptist vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1-20 , and then He was baptized v. 21 and anointed v. 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we shall see, the inauguration of the Man-Savior mainly involves His being baptized by John the Baptist and His being anointed by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, this inauguration is an introduction, but it is more than merely an introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To introduce a person does not mean to officially put him into office.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But to inaugurate a person means not only to introduce him, but also to usher him officially into his office.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the foregoing chapters, the Man-Savior was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through His conception, birth, and youth He was prepared as a complete Person to be our Savior in His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now in chapter three it is necessary for Him to be introduced and ushered into His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in 3:1-22 we have a record of the inauguration of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regarding this inauguration, both John the Baptist and God the Father played a part.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John did something on man s side, and the Father did something on God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>INTRODUCED BY JOHN THE BAPTIST Preaching the Baptism of Repentance</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 3:3-14 we see that John the Baptist came preaching the baptism of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 3 says that he came into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Repentance is a matter of changing the mind, of turning the mind to the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Baptism is a matter of burying the repenting people, terminating them so that the Man-Savior may germinate them by regeneration John 3:3, 5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to 3:3, the baptism of repentance was for the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word translated for also means unto.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Repentance with baptism is for, and results in, forgiveness of sins, so that the obstacle of man s fall may be removed and man may be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Luke 3:4 through 6 say, As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked places shall become straight, and the rough places smooth roads; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 3:4 to prepare the way of the Lord and to make His paths straight means to change people s minds, turning their minds toward the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It also means to make their hearts right, to straighten every part of their hearts through repentance, so that the Man-Savior may enter into them to be their life and take possession of them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 3:5 ravine, mountain, crooked places, and rough places are figures of speech describing the condition of men s hearts toward God and toward each other and the relationships among men 1:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both the condition of men s hearts and their relationships need to be dealt with for the way to be prepared for the Savior s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 6 says that all flesh will see the salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here flesh refers to fallen men, and salvation denotes the Savior as the salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John s Word to the Crowds</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 3:7-9 John said to the crowds who came to be baptized by him, Brood of vipers!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Produce then fruits worthy of your repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves, We have Abraham for our father, for I tell you that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And already also the axe is laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brood of vipers in verse 7 equals children of the Devil in 1 John 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 8 John the Baptist told the people that God was able to raise up children to Abraham out of the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Due to the impenitence of the Jews, both this word and the word in verse 9 have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has cut them off and raised up the believing Gentiles to be children unto Abraham in faith Rom 11:15, 19-20, 22; Gal 3:7, 28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This also indicates that the kingdom of God is constituted not of children of Abraham by birth, but of children of Abraham by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 9 John says that every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This fire is the fire in the lake of fire Rev 20:15 , where the unbelievers will suffer eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 3:10-14 we have a record of John s word to the crowds, to the tax collectors, and to some who were serving in the military.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To those of the crowd who asked him what to do, John said, He who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise v. 11 . To the tax collectors who came to be baptized, John said, Exact no more than what you have been instructed v. 13 . To those serving in the military he said, Extort nothing from anyone by force, nor take anything from anyone by false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages v. 14 . What John says here is related to morality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By this we see that in his Gospel Luke emphasizes morality because his intention is to present the Man-Savior in the highest standard of morality.</S>
