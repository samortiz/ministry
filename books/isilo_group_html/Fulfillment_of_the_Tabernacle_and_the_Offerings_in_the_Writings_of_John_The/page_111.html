In verse 32 she said, &#8220;Lord, if You were here, my brother would not have died.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>The Jews&#8217; Opinion</h2><p>Verse 33 says, &#8220;When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in His spirit, and was troubled&#8221; (v. 33). The Lord groaned in His spirit because He realized that no one, including Mary, knew Him. The Bible says that the Lord groaned in His spirit, not in His emotion. In His spirit He was one with God and was having fellowship with God. He realized the situation and perceived that everyone around Him, the unbelievers, Martha and Mary, and all the disciples, did not know Him. That was the reason the Lord groaned and even wept (v. 35).<p>Expressing their opinion, the Jews said, &#8220;Behold how he loved him! But some of them said, Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have also caused that this man should not die?&#8221; (vv. 36-37). These verses indicate that the Jews did not understand why the Lord wept. They thought that Jesus wept out of love for Lazarus. The Lord, however, did not weep for that reason. He groaned in His spirit and wept because of their ignorance of Him. None of them knew Him. At that very moment, the Lord was the resurrection and the life. But no one realized this. What a pitiful situation! The situation today is similar. Not many Christians truly know the Lord. Not many know Him as resurrection, as life, and as the present One.<h2 class=head2>Martha&#8217;s Opinion Again</h2><p>When they came to the cave where Lazarus was buried, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Take away the stone&#8221; (v. 39). But Martha, expressing her opinion again, said, &#8220;Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he has been there&#8221; (v. 39b). This opinion caused further frustration. If there had not been any opinion, it is likely that the Lord Jesus would have resurrected Lazarus at least half a day earlier. But all the different opinions delayed the resurrection of Lazarus.<h2 class=head1>A LIFE-GIVING SAVIOR</h2><p>Eventually, the Lord overcame all the opinions, and Lazarus came out of the tomb. This is resurrection. The resurrection of Lazarus is a sign indicating that the Lord Jesus is not merely a healing Savior, but is a life-giving Savior. The Lord wants to give us life, to resurrect us, not only to heal us. But in our concept we have the thought of healing, not the thought of life-giving. The reason we do not have the thought of life-giving is that we do not realize what our need actually is. We may think that our need is to be healed of our sickness. Actually, our problem is not merely sickness-our problem is death. Therefore, we need not only healing, but we need life-giving.<p>Chapter eleven of the Gospel of John is a clear picture of all of us under the power of death. We have even begun to smell. Hence, we not only need healing; we need the Lord as the life-giver. We need Him to give us life.<p>All Christians appreciate the Lord Jesus as the Savior. However, not many appreciate Him as the life-giving Savior. Rather, they may only realize that as the Savior He is mighty, sufficient, and able. When I was young, I was not taught that Jesus Christ is our Savior in the sense of being the One who gives us life, that He saves us by giving life to us. We need the Lord not only as a mighty Savior; we also need Him as the life-giving Savior. Instead of merely asking the Lord to help you, ask Him to give you life. We need to say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, I need Your life-giving. Lord, impart Yourself into my being as life. I need You as my life. Lord, I&#8217;m not only sick and weak-I&#8217;m dying. My sickness is not a disease; my sickness is death. Therefore, what I need, Lord, is You imparted into me to be my life.&#8221; This is resurrection.<p>God&#8217;s salvation is a matter of resurrection, not a matter of healing. Regeneration is the initial stage of resurrection. Every aspect of God&#8217;s salvation involves resurrection. After resurrecting us through regeneration, the Lord is now continuing this process of resurrection by sanctifying and transforming us. Eventually, the Lord will glorify us. That glorification will be the consummation of resurrection. God&#8217;s salvation, therefore, is a process of resurrection. He has resurrected us in our regeneration, and now He is continually resurrecting us through sanctification and transformation. Then as the consummation of the process of resurrection, He will glorify us.<p>Later on we shall see that chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John are in the Holy of Holies. Everyone who enters the Holy of Holies has not only been forgiven of his sins by God, but is also one fully resurrected from the natural life. Whoever enters the Holy of Holies must pass through the riven veil. This veil signifies our flesh, our natural man. The natural man must be set aside. Then when we come into the Holy of Holies, we shall no longer be a natural man. Rather, we shall be a resurrected person, a person regenerated and transformed. In resurrection life we then may have direct fellowship with God in the Holy of Holies.<p>The Apostle John shows us that in order to come into the Holy of Holies, we need to begin our journey at the altar, at the cross. Then in life we need to experience Christ as the showbread table and the lampstand. When we enter the Holy of Holies, we shall no longer be natural; we shall be fully in resurrection fellowshipping with our God. In this way we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_110.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_112.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 111</div><br></body></html>
