Yes, the New Testament commands us to love one another. However, it does not say that we should reject a person if he does not follow the teaching about loving others. The same is true regarding the doctrine of foot-washing. In John 13 the Lord Jesus speaks of washing one another&rsquo;s feet. However, this chapter does not say that we should refuse to have fellowship with another believer because he does not practice foot-washing. In the same principle, although the New Testament speaks emphatically about baptism, we are never told to reject a believer because he has not been baptized. We should not separate ourselves from those believers who differ from us in doctrine.</p><p>We need to remember Romans 14 and practice it. Today many Christian teachers are talking about the Body in Romans 12 without paying adequate attention to Romans 14. Apart from Romans 14 we cannot practice the Body life revealed in Romans 12. Only through being liberal toward others with respect to doctrine can we have the Body life.</p><p>Among many Christians today there is no practice of the Body life. Instead, there is division after division. In fact, there is more division among earnest Christians than among those who are worldly or indifferent to the Lord and His Word. When Christians are revived and renewed in reading the Bible, they are more easily divided over doctrine. Because of the divisiveness in today&rsquo;s Christianity, most Christians do not have the Body life. This is especially true in the charismatic movement. Although many in this movement are fond of talking about the Body, there is more divisiveness in the charismatic movement than in any other aspect of Christianity. The reason for this is that Christians talk about Romans 12, but neglect Romans 14. I repeat, only by practicing Romans 14 do we have the reality of the Body described in Romans 12.</p><p>According to Romans 14, there is room in the church life for those with different doctrines. Some believe that they can eat everything, whereas others eat only herbs. In like manner, some observe certain days, whereas others regard every day the same. Do you realize that in the church life there can be different doctrines, and there should be? Take the example of head covering. Some sisters wear a head covering in the meetings, but many sisters do not. This indicates that among the sisters there are different doctrines concerning head covering. It is a very positive sign that the church can include both those sisters who wear a head covering and those who do not. I have been in Christian meetings where sisters without a head covering were not welcome. Furthermore, the sisters who wear a head covering have different kinds of coverings and coverings of different colors. But I have been in meetings where the sisters were required to wear head coverings of the same size, style, and color. Praise the Lord that in the church life we are not divided over different matters such as these! How wonderful that in the church we receive those with different doctrines concerning head covering!</p><p>Although we may differ in doctrine, we are truly one. But those who are preoccupied with doctrine often argue about whether or not certain doctrines or practices are scriptural. However, we can declare that the most scriptural meeting is the meeting in which believers with different doctrines are received. As we contend for the faith and reject the four categories of negative things we have mentioned, we are liberal toward others with respect to doctrine. This is the only way to preserve the oneness. If we dispute over doctrine, we shall repeat Christianity&rsquo;s history of division.</p><h2 class="head1">ESCAPING FROM THE SNARE OF DOCTRINE</h2><p>About a century and a half ago, the Brethren were raised up by the Lord and came to see many truths in the Bible. Certainly this was of the Lord. However, the Brethren eventually were snared by doctrinal knowledge and were divided again and again. In some cases they cared more for their interpretation of the Bible than for Christ. For this reason, there are hundreds of divisions among the Brethren today. If you visit certain Brethren assemblies, they may argue with you about doctrine, yet have little care for the Spirit or for the living Christ. How pitiful to care for our interpretation of the Bible but to neglect the Lord Jesus!</p><p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have escaped from the trap of doctrine and are being brought back to the Lord Himself. How I praise the Lord for rescuing me from doctrinal knowledge! We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have no appetite for doctrine. At the same time, we reject idolatry, fornication, division, and the denial of Christ&rsquo;s deity. Although we are strict about these negative things, we are liberal toward others about doctrine. We are not for doctrines, practices, or ordinances. We care only for Christ as the Head and the church as the Body. Therefore, we are truly one.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_264.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_266.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Ephesians &nbsp; pg 265</div><br></body></html>
