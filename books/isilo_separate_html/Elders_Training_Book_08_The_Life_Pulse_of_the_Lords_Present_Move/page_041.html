AND REGARDING A CHURCH EVEN THOUGH IT<br />
MAY NOT ACCEPT THE PRESENT NEW WAY</h2>
<p>Any church which is a genuine local church standing on the ground of oneness and recognizing the other local churches as churches in one fellowship is a church, regardless of whether or not that church accepts the present new way. If a church chooses not to practice the new way, that church does not cease to be a church. To practice this would be sectarian. We do not practice this. We practice the all-inclusive church life.</p>
<p>We realize that if the Lord is to go on to make His recovery prevailing, there is no other way but this present move. However, if a church meeting properly would not take this present new way, then we still respect them as a proper church. We would still keep the fellowship with them, even though they do not feel the need of the new way. Even if they would oppose, we would not reject them. When they say that they are no longer a church in the recovery, then that is their cutting off the fellowship, not us. Do not cut off any church who would not be agreeable to the present new move. If a church opposes a little and yet still recognizes all the other churches on this globe for the fellowship in the Body, we would not only recognize but also respect and regard them as a genuine church among the many local churches. We not only like to, but we also will try our best to maintain proper fellowship with them. Do not be sectarian.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT PROMOTING SPEAKING IN TONGUES</h2>
<p>I do not like the promotion of tongue-speaking, but I do not reject the genuine tongue-speaking. If anyone would still speak in tongues, that is quite all right. However, for the good of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and for the good of so many saints, I would ask them to please not promote it. I have the experience, the right, and the position to say this because I saw and experienced the damage that tongue-speaking causes.</p>
<p>The present tongue-speakers cannot deny that there are false prophesies, as well as a lot of other false things. Therefore, I do not like to see a promotion of tongue-speaking in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. But I do not like to practice sectarianism or be narrow. We will still receive the brothers who speak in tongues, yet we will beg them not to promote it. Not only with tongue-speaking, but with other items, our attitude is the same. As long as something is not sinful or immoral, we do not reject it. Yet if something is not so profitable to the church life, we would beg the saints not to promote it. We do not reject, and we like to exercise restraint. We would use the way of begging and fellowshipping. We would not give anyone a command to stop their promotion. We like to go to them, sit down with them, and in a loving way with a very humble spirit fellowship about these things, hoping that they would realize the real situation. The real profit for everyone concerned may be that they would exercise some restriction to their promotion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT FORMING PARTIES</h2>
<p>We also do not like to form parties. I do not like to hear some say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I stand with you.&rdquo; I do not like anyone to stand with me in order to have a party. I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for over one half of a century. Many can testify for me that in the Far East, on Mainland China, in Taiwan, and in this country, I never tried to make anyone side with me to make a party. Do not make parties. It may be okay to be &ldquo;the three hundred of Gideon,&rdquo; but do not form a party. The three hundred with Gideon still loved the children of Israel and fought the battle for them. They never considered themselves as a separate party. That would have been a division. We do not agree with division. We must have a proper attitude and a good spirit toward all the brothers and the sisters. Whether they would take this new way or not, we do not change our attitude. Our attitude must be a loving attitude. We simply must be faithful to what we have seen and fight the battle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF A TRAINING CENTER AT LIN-KO</h2>
<p>Regarding the building of a new training center in Taiwan at Lin-ko, I am a little concerned that you may go to an extreme in your zeal, thinking that you all should quit your job, give up your family and the church, and just go to Lin-ko. Please do not do things that way. You still have to take care of your job and your church. We realize that what is going on in Lin-ko is something of the Lord. Securing that property and completing the accompanying project have very much to do with the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It will bring in a lot of benefits not only for Taiwan but also for His move on the whole earth.</p>
<p>It is altogether needed that all the churches around the globe would share in the financial support. This I encourage you to do, but not by forgetting about the local needs. This is not right. We have to be moderate in all things. All of the time we have to be balanced and restricted. We are encouraged and excited in many ways, yet we are moderate and balanced. Exercise your wisdom by observing the situation not only in your own locality, but also for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on the whole globe. Based upon this kind of view, I believe the Lord, the Spirit, will lead you to participate in the financial support to a certain extent. I cannot give you the extent. Only the Lord would lead you. This financial support is not only needed, but also it is a nice thing, a beauty in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Suppose all the churches in Brazil would send seven hundred dollars to that project. How beautiful it would be! How good it would be that all the churches in Spain would send something. That would be marvelous! It would be a beauty. I would like to see this, but I do not like to see you forgetting everything, and putting everything, even every drop of blood and every penny into Lin-ko. I reject that. I say no to that. Do not go the crazy way.</p>
<p>What we are able to build at Lin-ko depends upon the Lord&rsquo;s leading and how much cooperation all the churches will render to that project. In principle we will hire the experienced contractors to do the foundation work and the framework for us. These two parts we could not do by ourselves due to safety factors. We must have a solid foundation properly laid by the experts. We have to spend a lot of money for this. We will do the rest by ourselves. We need a lot of manpower. By then we may have over five hundred young full-timers, of whom at least half will be brothers. We could use the sisters for painting and other projects. The full-timers will do the rest of the work in order that they may learn how to build meeting halls for the spreading of the church life in different villages. Then after this no hall will be contracted to anybody. All the young workers will go out to build the halls for themselves and by themselves. This is our intention. There is surely the need of a lot of experienced ones from the United States to go to Taiwan. The Chinese young people need some instructions. We need at least fifty foremen to take the lead. I think all the foreman should be from the United States. All the brothers who go will be there to be the foremen taking the lead in every part of the construction process. Do not go to Lin-ko in a rush. Go there by much fellowshipping and much prayer. Your action should not damage your local church at all. However, it may delay and it will delay. This is unavoidable. The delay is worthwhile because we are going to carry out a big project for the move of the Lord today on the earth. Pray for this.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
