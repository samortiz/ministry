   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. NO IDOLS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that in verse 23 the people were commanded not to make gods of silver or gold.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse mentions only idols of gold and silver, not idols of other materials such as wood and stone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, this verse implies that we should not worship silver or gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Acts 3, a lame man asked Peter and John for alms.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Peter said to him, Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene walk! v. 6 . Peter did not have silver and gold, but he had the name of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the worship of God we should give no place to riches, no place to gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus tells us that we cannot serve God and mammon Matt 6:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot at the same time serve God and gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to exist, we need money, but we must not allow money to occupy us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be occupied with the desire for riches is to make idols of gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Timothy 6:17 says, Charge those who are rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who affords us all things richly for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who have gold and silver in this age should not hold on to the uncertainty of wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, they should hold on to the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is easy for a Christian to say that he does not have any idols.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, it is not so easy for Christians to testify that they do not hold on to riches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not wrong to have wealth, but to hold on to wealth instead of holding on to the living God is to worship idols.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would worship in a pure way, all idols must go, including the idolatry of laying hold on riches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From experience we know that if we hold on to riches, our worship to God will be nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As long as we still hold on to riches, we cannot offer God genuine and pure worship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the commandment not to make gods of gold and silver implies that in our worship of God we should not give any place to riches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The situation among many Christians today is degraded because of the place given to money and fund-raising.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To a large extent, Christianity has become a religion characterized by the worship of the golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is common for those who make large donations to be singled out and given public honor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is to make gods of gold and silver, and it is also the worship of the golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THROUGH THE ALTAR THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hebrews 13:10 says, We have an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The altar denotes the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The altar in the Old Testament was a shadow, the reality of which is the cross in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Fallen man cannot worship God directly without an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The altar points to a process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In such a process we have redemption and also the termination of all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the word altar is rich in its implications.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Related to the altar, we have death, burning, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This involves redemption, the termination of negative things, and the resurrection of positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Apart from the altar, the cross, it is not possible for such a process to take place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, without an altar, fallen people have no way to worship God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we have seen, the altar was to be erected with material created by God, either earth or stone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that the cross has been prepared entirely by the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The fact that hewn stone, material worked on by man, was not to be used in making the altar indicates that the cross was not prepared by man s work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God, not man, prepared the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If God had not worked to prepare the cross for us, there would not be anything we could do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In these verses erecting an altar means receiving what God has prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God has prepared the cross for us to worship Him, and we should simply receive it, saying Amen with thanksgiving to God for His work of preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should say, God, thank You for preparing the cross that I may worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no need for me to work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I simply receive the cross You have prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fact that the children of Israel could erect an altar either of earth or stone indicates that the cross is readily available.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If God had commanded His people to build an altar only of stone, the children of Israel might have had difficulty finding the materials.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the earth was always available.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, an altar made of earth points to the availability of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our receiving of the cross may be rather weak, like earth, or strong, like stone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In their receiving of the cross, many believers are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Others, however, are quite strong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How we receive the cross, in a strong way or in a weak way, depends on us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The principle here is similar to the use of animals of different sizes in the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One person could offer an ox or a lamb, whereas another could offer doves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was permissible to build an altar of earth or of stone, to receive the cross either in a strong way or in a weak way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In either case, the cross is still the cross, prepared by God in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have no part in the preparation of the material.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We simply receive what God has prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the receiving of the cross there is no place for man s work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A great heresy in Catholicism is that there is room for man s work to be added; man s working is given place in receiving the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But according to the Bible, the earth or the stones made by God were to be used to make an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If someone had regarded such an altar as too crude and wanted to hew the stones to make them more beautiful, that would have caused pollution.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To add man s work to God s work of preparation is to bring in pollution.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Throughout the centuries of church history, many have tried to beautify God s work of preparation by man s work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Their attitude has been that God s work lacks beauty and needs man to add something to make it more beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Even today certain preachers do not like to speak simple words.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To them, this is foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Nevertheless, in 1 Corinthians 1:23-24 Paul says, We preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offense, and to the nations foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God s power and God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In Paul s preaching of the cross there was no beauty, but there was the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, in the sugar-coated sermons preached today there is beauty, but no power or wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When man s beautifying work is added to God s work of preparation, the result is pollution.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Oh, how much today s Christianity has polluted God s work!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This pollution has come primarily through the work of man.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many Christians prefer hewn and polished stones to the natural stones created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Thus, they change the work of God and pollute it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Furthermore, according to 20:26, the people were not to go up by steps unto the Lord s altar.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They were not permitted to make steps for the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Steps refer to the man-made way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Every denomination has its own kind of steps.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>These steps cause man s nakedness to be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The altar prepared by God is not elevated.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>On the contrary, it is close to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This eliminates the need for steps and makes it possible for anyone to approach the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Praise the Lord that the cross is on our level, so available!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There are no levels of man s attainments for his boasting and glorifying.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Steps give place for man s attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Consider how many steps there are in a system with bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and a pope.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But the cross of Christ has no steps; it is on our level.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There is no place for human attainment or achievement, no place for man s way.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must reject every man-made way to the cross.</S>
