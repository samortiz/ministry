   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVE CAME OUT OF ADAM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Adam needed a help meet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What did God do to meet this need?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 2:19-20 says, "And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God brought every kind of living creature before Adam, but Adam could not find his help meet among them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>None of the living creatures made out of earth could be a help meet for Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, "the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This one was Adam's help meet and the figure of the church in Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible says very clearly that all of the things made of earth and not taken out of the body of Adam could not be his help meet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the beasts of the field, the cattle, and the birds of the air were made of earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were not taken out of Adam; therefore, they could not be the help meet to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must remember that Eve was formed out of a rib taken from Adam; therefore, Eve was the constituent of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that the church comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only that which is out of Christ can be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anything that is not of Christ is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to note a few more words in Genesis 1:26 and 27.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 26 says, "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them..."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Hebrew language the word "man" is singular, but immediately following, the plural pronoun "them" is used.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The same pattern is used in verse 27 which says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The noun "man" is singular, but the following pronoun "them" is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God created one man; but we can also say that He created two!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One is two, and yet the two are one because Eve was in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Notice further that verse 27 says, "God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way God created "man" is the same way He created "them."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only was Adam created, but Eve also was included in him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"God created man in his own image."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This "man" is singular and typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"In the image of God created He...them."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Them" is plural and typifies Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God not only wants to have an only begotten Son, He also wants many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The many sons must be just like the one Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From these verses we see that if the church is not in a state which corresponds with Christ, God will not rest and His work will not be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only is Adam in the image of God, so also is Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only does Christ have the life of God, the church also has God's life.</S>
