   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT EATING AND DRINKING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: John 4:14; 6:35, 57, 63; 7:37-39; 1 Cor 3:2; 10:3-4; Heb 5:12b-14a; 1 Pet 2:2-3; Rev 2:7b; 3:20; 7:16-17; 21:6b; 22:1-2, 17; Matt 22:2-3; Luke 14:16-17; 15:22-23; 1 Cor 10:21; Rev 19:9 EATING AND DRINKING THE CENTRAL THOUGHT IN GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eating and drinking Christ is the central thought in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This central thought of eating and drinking is not only in the Old Testament but also in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The concept of eating and drinking starts at the very beginning of the Bible in Genesis and continues until the end of the Bible in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In God's economy God does not present Himself to us as a kind of religion, but He presents Himself to us as food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we realize the proper significance of the verses in the Scripture reading, we will see that eating and drinking is the central thought in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Gospel Being a Feast</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Matthew 22 the Lord Jesus likened the gospel of God to a marriage or wedding feast, a great supper, prepared by a king for his son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, the gospel is a matter of enjoyment by eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Luke 14:16-17 the Lord Jesus again likens the gospel to a great dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God, as the certain man, sent His slave to tell those who had been invited, "Come, for it is now ready" v. 17 . God has prepared His full salvation as a great dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We come not to learn teachings but to enjoy by eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we were saved, we started the enjoyment of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After we are saved, the Lord always sets a feast before us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was saved, although no one told me, I did have the sense that something within me was just for my enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was so nourishing, so refreshing, so watering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I was so happy in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But soon after my initial experience, I was turned to care only for teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I became filled with teachings, but within I was empty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christianity is a religion full of teachings, but the Lord's desire is to recover His gospel as a real feast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The gospel is a feast where all things are ready, and we simply come to eat, drink, and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The central concept of the New Testament is eating and drinking Christ in order that we may feast on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Luke 15, when the prodigal son returned, the father told his slaves to put the best robe on him, a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet v. 22 . For his body there was the robe, for his hand the ring, and for his feet the sandals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These items signify the Father's outward justification through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This outward clothing, however, was not sufficient to meet the son's need since he was starving.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He needed food within him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His father first adorned him to make him worthy, thus qualifying him to enter the father's house and feast with the father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the outward adornment, the father told his slaves, "Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry" Luke 15:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need not only the outward adorning but also the inward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The robe, the ring, and the sandals are the outward side, the side of justification by the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the observance of the Passover, the blood covered the house Exo 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Under the covering of the blood, the people enjoyed the meat of the lamb v. 8 . Likewise, under the covering of the robe, the prodigal son enjoyed the slaughtered, fattened calf with his father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the inward side which signifies the inward enjoyment of Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is the robe, and Christ is also the fattened calf.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is for our outward covering, and Christ is also for our inward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should enjoy Him as the fattened calf day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Father's house we have a feast, a table.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before the prodigal son came back, he prepared himself to be treated as a slave, laboring day by day for his father Luke 15:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But his father did not want his son to labor for him but to feast with him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we come to the local church, we must drop the thought of coming to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We come to the Father's house, the local church, for feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Father's house there is a table waiting for us to come and feast.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just come to eat and be merry Luke 15:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord Jesus will be satisfied, the Father will be happy, and we will be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need such a feast.</S>
