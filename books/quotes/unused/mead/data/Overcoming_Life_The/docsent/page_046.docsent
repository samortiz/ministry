   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>11 CONSECRATION Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to sin, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and your members as weapons of righteousness to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 6:13 I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And do not be fashioned according to this age,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>but be transformed by the renewing of the mind</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>that you may prove what the will of God is,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 12:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tonight is the last evening of our conference on The Overcoming Life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is one thing that we have to mention tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The previous messages would not take us very far if we only stopped at last night s message.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we could not have addressed tonight s subject earlier, because it would not have been right to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, tonight, we have to speak on the matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first thing we have to do after we have experienced the overcoming life is to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, this should be the first thing that a person does after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, many people have never consecrated themselves even though they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, after they have entered into the experience of the overcoming life, they have to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are some who consecrated themselves to the Lord after they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, they have risen and fallen throughout the years, and they are not as fresh as they once were.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, they also need to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I dare not say that consecration is the first step or first expression of our overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I can say only that since the Lord died for us and lives for us, the first thing we should do after we overcome is consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some have said that we should consecrate ourselves before we overcome and that we must consecrate ourselves before we can overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, Romans 6:13 says, Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as weapons of righteousness to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows us that consecration comes after experiencing the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is an obvious fact: A person cannot consecrate himself before he experiences death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only those who have died and resurrected can consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the past few days, we have been speaking of our crucifixion with Christ and of His living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are those who have died with Christ and who are living with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, from Romans 6:13, we see that a Christian consecrates himself after he has experienced the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a person has not experienced the overcoming life, he cannot consecrate himself, and even if he did, God would not accept his consecration, because He does not want anything that is related to Adam or death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have not experienced the overcoming life, our consecration is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we may consecrate ourselves and tomorrow we may forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today we may make a vow before the Lord, telling the Lord that we will do this and do that, but tomorrow we may forget all about it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There was a missionary who attended seven Keswick Conventions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She said that attending the Keswick Convention every year was like winding up the spring inside a watch.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The watch would slow down, and she would wind it up again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every year she went for a winding up, and every year she found herself slowing down again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the way with many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They make big promises before God, but when they go away, everything is forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why I say that we cannot consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not have the strength to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have not experienced the overcoming life, God will not receive our consecration even if we do consecrate ourselves, because everything we have is from Adam and is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We say thank you to the unbelievers and refuse to accept their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The same is true with God; He cannot accept our gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only that which is from the Lord can be consecrated to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Anything that comes from ourselves cannot be consecrated to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must realize that the first thing we should do after experiencing the overcoming life is consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now is the time to consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now there is an opportunity to consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not consecrate ourselves now, we will draw back, and we will fail again in a few days.</S>
