   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 2:19-23; 3:15; 4:1, 3, 4, 12-16; 11:19, 25-30; 12:6, 8, 19-20, 41b, 42b; 13:55-57; 16:18; 18:17; 21:42; 28:19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Scriptures are a record of a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that in the past three messages, we have seen what a wonderful person the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This wonderful person is for the producing of the church, and eventually He becomes the Head of this entity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the Head, and the church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is what is called in the New Testament, the New Man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This New Man is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before producing the church, He was the individual Christ, but after producing the church, this wonderful person becomes the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE DEPTHS OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christians have seen that the Lord Jesus was incarnated to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And they have seen that He died on the cross for our sins, was buried, resurrected, and is now in the third heavens at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, they believe that He is coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All of these things are true, but they are very elementary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, on the outside of a man we see his nose, his ears, his eyes, and his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We see his two shoulders, his arms, and his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is easy to speak about all of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this is not the real person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is just the framework, the superficial exterior and structure of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His real person is something else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To see his exterior framework is easy, but it is not so easy to know what is inside of him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, we should not think that it is easy to know the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus said in the Gospel of Matthew that only the Father knows the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him Matt 11:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the Father knows the Son, and only the Son knows the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not easy to know Jesus in a deep way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is really in Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a vast, deep, unsearchable, immeasurable, and unlimited ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we do have some terms in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the one book of the Gospel of Matthew, there are many terms regarding Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, I am afraid that most Christians read this Gospel with colored glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They read it according to the traditional knowledge that they have received from the past.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not many have seen that Jesus is the greater Solomon, the greater Jonah, and even the greater temple.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>DIFFERENT NAMES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Gospel of Matthew, there are many names attributed to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, the first is Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have seen something about this in the previous messages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, He is not only the son of David and the son of Abraham; he is also called the carpenter s son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Is not this the carpenter s son?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Matt 13:55 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is also called the greater temple Matt 12:6 , the greater Jonah Matt 12:41 , and the greater Solomon Matt 12:42 , the Lord of the Sabbath Matt 12:8 , the great light Matt 4:16 , and the stone rejected by the builders Matt 21:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was also ascribed with some bad names.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Did you know that Jesus was called a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was also called the friend of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We like to hear this now, but it was not good in those days.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners Matt 11:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jesus had all kinds of poor names.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He would eat anywhere with anyone, especially with publicans and sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He did this because His sole purpose was to dispense Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Regardless of whether they were a sinner, a publican, or a Pharisee, He did whatever He could to impart Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was not for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His eating gave Him the opportunity to impart Himself into a publican by the name of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It seems that Matthew invited Jesus to come and eat with him, and He went.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Pharisees condemned Him for it, but Jesus did not care.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By His eating, Matthew was fully caught, and in time one of the foremost publicans became one of the foremost disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Jesus was not legal or religious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was very flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As long as He could dispense Himself into someone, He did not care what He had to do.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If it was eating, He would eat.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whatever Jesus was, and whatever He was called was only for the purpose of dispensing Himself in God s chosen people, that they might be converted and transformed into His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>His only purpose was to produce the church.</S>
