Before the Lord entered Jerusalem, many people broke branches and took off their garments and laid them on the street. Had they not done this, the Lord could not have entered Jerusalem. This does not mean that the branches and the garments are the way in and of themselves, but it does mean that these ones first had to break many branches and take off many garments to cover the way before the Lord could enter the city in His glory. The Lord rode into Jerusalem on a colt as a King. Some had to break branches, remove garments, and lay them on the street so that the Lord could pass over them. If the gospel is to go out, we have to consecrate ourselves to be the way. Today it is not enough to merely break branches and take away garments. Our very person has to be the way. If we have any reservations, if we hold back anything, or if we are unwilling to fall down, the Lord will have no way. The Lord must have a way through us before the gospel will have a way in the world. We must regard the gospel like chariots, horses, and colts, and we ourselves have to be the way. The gospel has to roll over us so that more people in the world will hear the gospel.</p><p>In this matter we have to be very desperate and violent. If we are desperate enough, we will spread the gospel throughout China no matter who is in control of the government. If the Lord has a way through us and the gospel has a way through us, it will be very easy for the gospel to spread throughout China. As long as something is for the Lord, we should not count the cost. We should not save anything from the Lord. For His sake, we should not spare anything. No spending is excessive when it is spent on the Lord and His gospel (John 12:7-8). We must have absolutely no reservation. We should not leave anything for the world.</p><p>This world is very dangerous. We have to ask the Lord to keep us from touching the world. May the Lord be gracious to us, and may He grant us a way. In order to be a proper Christian we have to be violent and decisive. Those who do not consecrate themselves invariably go away in sorrow. The more absolute our consecration is, the more joy we will have. If we do not consecrate ourselves, even the life within us will rise up to protest against us.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Lord, when we were blind, we did not see Your preciousness. When we were blind, we saw only the world; our eyes were filled only with mammon. Tonight we ask You to show us Your glory. May we be willing to drop everything and forsake everything on account of Your shining face on the throne.</p><p>Lord, stir us up so that we will be more violent, desperate, and thorough, abandoning everything to follow You. May more people give themselves through our giving. Show the brothers and sisters that mammon and the world are hurting them; they do not help them. Lord, we do not belong to this world but to You. Just as You have shed Your blood on the cross for the gospel's sake, may more people shed their sweat for the gospel's sake. Perhaps some will even have to shed their blood for the gospel's sake. Since You have shed Your blood on the cross for the gospel's sake, may we suffer a little for Your sake, and may we shed our sweat and deny ourselves for the gospel's sake.</p><p>Lord, may You turn the church around fully in the coming days. May the whole church be conquered and subdued. First gain the church in Hong Kong, and then spread the gospel through it. It seems that men do not know You today. It seems that You are hidden. But we deeply yearn for the day when the gospel will have a breakthrough from the church.</p><p>Lord, we ask again: Reveal Your shining face to us. Teach us to forsake everything and to have a change in concept and valuation towards everything. May we be blind to the world and to mammon, and may we have a high and glorious valuation of Yourself and Your gospel. Be merciful to us. Amen.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
