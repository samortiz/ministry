   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE APPLICATION The tribute men</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is sovereign: He can send some very wonderful persons like Moses and Elijah, and He can also send some troublesome people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the last portion of these two chapters we read, "And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter" 17:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Tax collectors are troublesome people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But notice, these tribute men are not the publicans; they are different.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The publicans were the tax gatherers for the Roman Empire, for those who invaded Judea, occupied it and put a heavy tax upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The tribute men in chapter 17 were those who gathered taxes, not for the Roman Empire or any other government, but for the maintenance of God's house, the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's people, the children of Israel, were told in Exodus 30:11-16 that every male among them must pay a half shekel to maintain God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God sent such men to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God sent Moses and Elijah to appear in their vision, but following the vision, in the application, God sent another kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you do mean business with the Lord, after you have seen the vision be careful and be ready God will send you some tribute men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who will be the tribute men to you?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps, firstly, your dear wife.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many times after we have received the vision, our dear wife comes just as a tribute man to collect something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may exclaim, "Thank God, I'm not married!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not have a wife, I do not have a husband: so there is no tribute man for God to send me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then the first tribute man to come to you may be your roommate or your classmate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the mountain top you see the vision, but when you get home, the tribute men arrive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the conference, in the meeting. you receive the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You shout, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are so happy with the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when you get within the door of your home, the tribute men will be waiting for you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is sovereign; He knows how to test you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes He uses our children, and many times He uses our in-laws as the tribute men.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He can use anyone and everyone to put us on the test.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot avoid it; we cannot run away; the tribute men will find us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every one of us has some tribute men.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter caught again</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The tribute men came to Peter, and again Peter took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the rest of the disciples were in the house with Jesus, and Peter came out to meet and deal with the tribute men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Again he got caught.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One who takes the lead always puts himself in a very dangerous position.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The tribute men said to Peter, "Doth not your Master pay tribute?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Peter, do not forget what you learned in Matthew 16, Christ and the church remember Peter?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not forget the revelation you received.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And secondly, Brother Peter, do not forget the lesson you learned so hard on the mountain top Christ and His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But listen, when the test came Peter forgot everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He forgot the revelation, he forgot the vision; he forgot Christ and the church, and He forgot the Head and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He forgot everything; he only remembered himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Doth not your Master pay tribute?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Yes," Peter immediately replied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Peter, how can you forget so quickly?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Didn't you hear the voice on the mountain saying that you must "hear Him"?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You must go to Him; you must ask Him; you should not answer yes or no. "Hear ye Him!" If we should speak in this way to Peter, Peter would argue, "Brother, you do not know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I can show you the chapter and verse telling us clearly that every male among the people of Israel must pay tribute, and Jesus is one of the males.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why shouldn't He pay?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Surely it is right for me to say yes."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Peter was very scriptural, very fundamental; Peter answered according to Moses' directions in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Peter answered the question according to the law by listening to Moses and hearing him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But what he said was absolutely against his revelation, absolutely contrary to his vision and the heavenly voice, "Hear ye Him."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no more Moses, no more law, no more Elijah, no more prophets only Jesus; hear ye Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why after he had seen the vision did he keep his old knowledge, his tradition, and religion?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After we see the vision, the old traditions, teachings and religion still hang on.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"Doth not your Master pay tribute?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"Yes!"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This "yes" comes from the old scriptural knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It comes from the very teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is a right, scriptural, and fundamental answer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But it is one hundred percent against the vision, one hundred percent against Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Peter then came into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I believe he returned with the intention of telling the Lord Jesus what he had done and to collect the money.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the Lord anticipated what he was going to say and forestalled him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord was not about to let him talk any more.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His implication was this: "Do not say that is scriptural, do not say that is fundamental; that is nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yes, that is according to your Bible, but not according to the living Christ, the present Christ."</S>
