   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Not Outward Decoration</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This understanding of regeneration shatters the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Using the illustration of a dog receiving a human life, we see that the natural concept is merely that a dog can be cleansed and beautified.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In principle, many Christians are occupied with cleansing people and beautifying them, instead of helping them receive the divine life and nature through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's way is not merely to wash us, beautify us, and decorate us outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His intention in His economy is to regenerate us, to cause us to be sons of God born of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This matter is unspeakably great.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no doubt that God's salvation includes cleansing by the redeeming blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a very real sense, we, the saved ones, have been cleansed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Being cleansed, however, is not the highlight of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The highlight is that God has regenerated us, that He has actually imparted His life and nature into us to make us His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we are not God's sons-in-law we are the sons of God in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Certainly there is no greater wonder in the whole universe than that sinful men by being regenerated can become sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many today are seeking wonders and miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But they do not realize that there is no greater miracle than regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By regeneration fallen people become sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In His salvation God has made us, fallen sinners, His divine sons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>C. Living as Sons of God</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not many Christians realize that they are sons of God and that God wants them to live the life of a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After they are saved, most Christians try to improve themselves or to do something to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In their efforts to improve the natural man or to do something to please God, the vast majority of the Lord's people are missing the mark of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's salvation is for His economy, and His economy is not a matter of ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, by His salvation according to His economy, God has regenerated us by the divine life that we may be His sons and live as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's goal is not simply that we improve our behavior and thereby do good instead of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not God's purpose merely to have a number of good people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's desire is that we live as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God wants us not simply to be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He wants us to live as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would do this, we need to receive the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have been born of the Spirit to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE CONSTANT RECEIVING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Galatians 3:5 says, "He therefore Who is supplying to you the Spirit and doing works of power among you, is it by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse indicates that God continues to supply us the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may use electricity as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After electricity has been installed in a building, electricity is supplied continually to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, after God regenerated us by His Spirit to make us His sons, He has been continually supplying to us the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing is more crucial than the constant receiving of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead of trying to behave religiously we should pray, "Lord Jesus, I open myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I thank You that I have been born of God, born of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lord, this Spirit is still transmitting something of You into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I thank You, Lord, for this marvelous transmission."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we will be the sons of God living by and enjoying the divine dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah for regeneration!</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Regeneration is the initiation of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God's Spirit enters into a person, his spirit is made alive; he is born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a spiritual birth in addition to our natural birth.</S>
