   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUALIFICATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many people assert that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a prosecutor I ask you first to check the qualification of these people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Are they qualified to make such claims?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Are those who assert that there is no God moral or immoral?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not just listen to their arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even robbers and swindlers have their arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of course, the arguments support them as robbers and swindlers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The subject of their arguments may be very noble; they may talk about the state of the nations and the welfare of society, but their opinions cannot be seriously considered.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are not worthy of passing such judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a man is upright in his conduct and moral judgment, we can give credibility to his words, but if not, his words lose their credibility.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is especially true when it relates to the question of deity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is interesting to note that the moral standards of men are directly related to their concept about God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who admit their own ignorance have a passable standard, while insistent atheists invariably have a low level of moral responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not claim to know all atheists, but of the several thousand that I know, none of them possess a notably commendable morality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may tell me that there was once a moral atheist, but if there was one, he is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Or you may tell me that there will be a moral atheist, but whoever he may be, he is not here yet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At least we can say that for now, we do not know a moral atheist.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NO ATHEIST IS MORAL</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once at a gathering at the University of Nanking, I remarked that no atheist is moral.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There were many students on the campus who did not believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They were greatly offended by these words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The next day, while I was speaking, they came and shuffled their feet in an attempt to distract me and the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The next day when they came again, they made funny gestures and faces at me and carried on continuously throughout the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the fourth day the vice-president of the university, Dr. Williams, came and said to me, "We had better change the place of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These students are infuriated by your assertion on the first day that atheists are not moral.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today they are not going to use their feet and lips only; they are going to use their fists.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I heard that they will be waiting at the entrance of the hallway and will jump on you when you step in."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I went along with the arrangement and conducted the meeting at another place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the way to the meeting I walked alongside many students and listened to their conversations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although many did not agree with me and felt uneasy about my preaching, they wanted to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One among them remarked, "Mr. Nee said that people who have no God have no sense of moral responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is perfectly right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can anyone with moral decency shuffle his feet and jest while others are delivering a speech?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yesterday they caused such a disturbance in the meeting, and today they are going to come to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is surely not what an honorable person would do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no doubt that those who do not believe in God do not have moral decency.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let us go to the meeting regardless of what they plan to do."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once a young man told a preacher, "When I was young, I seriously believed in God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But now that I am in college.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I can no longer believe in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fifty-year-old preacher patted the young man's shoulder and said, "My son, you do not believe in God anymore!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me ask you a question: Since you have been converted to be an atheist, have you advanced morally?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Has atheism helped you become better?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Has it made your thoughts cleaner or your heart purer?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Or did it make you just the opposite?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That young man felt ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He admitted that he had gone downhill morally since his denial of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The preacher pressed on: "I am afraid that you are not really saying that you believe there is no God, you are just hoping that there is no God."</S>
