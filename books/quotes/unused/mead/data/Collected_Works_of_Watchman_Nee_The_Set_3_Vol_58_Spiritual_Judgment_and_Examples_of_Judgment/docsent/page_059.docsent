   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 39 Date:August 17, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER Y. T.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a family steeped in Buddhism and Confucianism.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I attended school at a denominational parochial school, I heard the Lord's gospel and immediately accepted Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I loved to subscribe to spiritual publications, in particular those put out by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once a brother helped me understand the truth concerning assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I had thought about going into a seminary, but when I met Brother Nee, he told me that very few great servants of the Lord had passed through seminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I did not have the light at that time and went through and graduated from a seminary anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From there I foolishly spent four years teaching in a Bible school.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Others used me during this time to oppose the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later I read the article "A Debate concerning Denominationalism" in The Christian, and I realized that the local church is right.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although I saw this truth, I did not take the ground myself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later I moved to southeast Asia and worked in the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was during this time that I began to feel dry and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I felt that I merely had doctrines; I did not have any life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I began to lose interest in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later I received from a brother the book Rethinking Our Work The Normal Christian Church Life .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After I read it I received the light and quit my job at the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Nee agreed that I would go to Shanghai to be trained and to live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet I had too many considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was uneasy at heart and did not submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am not qualified to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May the Lord be merciful to me so that my one talent will become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May this uncomely member become comely, and may the Lord be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, you are quite seeking, and you are doing your best to take the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, as you have confessed, you spend too much time considering many things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are two kinds of people with regards to spiritual things: those who admire and those who consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The second kind have offered up everything in an absolute way and have cast every consideration aside.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have enough admiration, but you are short in consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because your consecration is shallow, your way is not straight.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to take this way, a man has to give up his all and offer everything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a man only admires but does not consecrate, he will be wasting his spiritual future.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have turned from one problem to another, from one way to another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the early days a group of people in Foochow admired much but accomplished nothing; they wasted their life because they were short in consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have enough light to turn away from the world, but you do not have enough light to destroy the love for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have enough light to know the errors, but you do not have enough light to depart from the errors and do the right things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of life is painful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that you will receive enough light this time to drop all the enjoyments of the world to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A man can only choose one kind of joy; he cannot have two kinds of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He cannot have spiritual joy and worldly joy at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If he does, he will be unhappy in both worlds.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is impossible to have spiritual joy and worldly joy at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You are better than many spiritual Christians already, yet you are still not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have to be a little more violent when it comes to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You have to be a little more violent in paying the price, in offering up your all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have to put everything into one basket.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To use a less refined term, you have to take a big gamble.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you have never consecrated yourself absolutely to the Lord, you will turn away at the first sight of a test.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit will not produce any result in you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope that you can have a fresh start and that God's tests will consummate in good results.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, you will suffer great loss before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You have been a believer for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You cannot say that the discipline of the Spirit has not produced any fruit during these twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But you must not run away before the discipline finishes its work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you do not humble yourself under the mighty hand of God, instead always planning a new start of your own, you will not see any result to your discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We become rich when the discipline of the Holy Spirit is turned into spiritual teachings for us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we cannot suffer to wait for the result of the discipline of the Spirit to consummate in us, we will waste His work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We do not have many decades to waste.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is a pity indeed if we do not receive the fruit of the discipline of the Spirit during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only those who have accepted the discipline of the Spirit have God's word, and only they can serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Brother, I advise you to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This will produce fruit, and you will be able to lead others on.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You have to be delivered from all forms of laziness and ease.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You have to make up your mind to offer yourself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not just admire the spiritual pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You will not receive anything if you only admire but do not sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the Lord operates in you, you have to stand on the Lord's side and allow the Spirit's discipline to produce some fruit in you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our brother also has to learn to hold himself back when he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If he is able to hold himself back, the spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Of course, there are those who need to release themselves before their spirit can come out.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Usually, however, a man has to hold himself back before his spirit can be released.</S>
