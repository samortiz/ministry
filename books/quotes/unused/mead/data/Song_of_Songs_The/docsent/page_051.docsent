   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 14 says, "His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word "rings" is the same word as "folding" in 1 Kings 6:34.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The purpose of the folding is to prevent something from slipping and being lost.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The gold rings tell us that the works of the Lord Jesus are capable of accomplishing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They will not fail halfway, because all the works issue from God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the rings are gold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Beryl" is mentioned a few times in the Old Testament, including Ezekiel 1:16 and Daniel 10:6.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In both places, the meaning is stability.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the former verse, though the Gentiles reigned, God's governmental wheel made of beryl still turned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the latter verse, we see the Christ of God whose body is beryl arbitrating the destiny of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, both the gold rings and the beryl speak of the stability of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word "belly" is the same as the word "bowels" in Songs of Songs 5:4.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that the Lord is a man of deep feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These feelings are directed toward His people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Ivory" is not like gems, which are without life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to have ivory, there must first be sufferings or even death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This signifies that the Lord's feeling for His people comes from His suffering and the great price He has paid.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Bright" can be translated as "wrought work of."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A wrought work is a fine work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This shows us that all His feelings are not shallow or casual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Sapphires," according to the Bible, are "the body of heaven in his clearness" Exo 24:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These sapphires overlay the perimeters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that when His feeling comes into contact with us, the contact is under the control of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 15 says, "His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Bible, the feet indicate movement, while "legs" signify an upright posture.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Marble" is translated many times in the Bible as "fine linen."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here it signifies His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Pillars" signify gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that our Lord and all He has are unshakable because of the righteousness He has established.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All those who have followed Him cannot fail to have this impression.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the maiden's description of her beloved, she mentions gold three times.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that the thoughts in His mind, the works of His hands, and the stability of His feet are all of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God controls His whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is a totally submissive person, who fully satisfies God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the One whom we know.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"His countenance is as Lebanon."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is higher than the earth, and He is living in the high places.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everything about Him speaks of Him as a heavenly person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Excellent as the cedars."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is a man, yet a glorified man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just as the cedar tree far transcends over all other trees, He is the only glorified man among all men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 16 says, "His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Finally, His mouth is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word "mouth" is not just the ordinary mouth, but the mouth with special reference to the taste.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This word is the same as the word "taste" in 2:3.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is very different from the lips.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The taste refers to the mediatorial work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It means that everything from God is first tasted by Him before being transferred to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything of God is first stored in Christ and then dispensed to us through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is His mediatorial work, and it is very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After we have known Him in this way, we cannot help but acknowledge that everything is of God and through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At this point, the listener's heart cannot help but be warmed, and the speaker's heart cannot help but be even warmer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In reviewing the way we have taken, and considering the Lord whom we confess, we cannot help but exclaim, "He is altogether lovely."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Anything that we speak of concerning Him is altogether lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who have not yet followed the Lord in an absolute way should realize that this is our Beloved!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is our Friend!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Can we be blamed for seeking after Him?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This description of her impression of the Lord is in a sense a description of the very Lord she knows.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is also a description of what she has received of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is also a description of her union with the Lord and the fellowship that has resulted from this union.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since she has seen the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face, she is reflecting His glory like a mirror and is being transformed to the Lord's image, from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By the end of her speaking, the sun has dawned upon her soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Her words are full of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is as if she is singing and proclaiming, "He is altogether lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is my beloved, and this is my friend."</S>
