   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ASKING GOD TO JUDGE HIM, EXAMINE HIM,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TRY HIM, AND TEST HIM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 26 reveals the mixed expressions of David's sentiment in his asking God to judge him, examine him, try him, and test him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Asking God to examine us, is like asking someone to come and examine a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is within us worthwhile for God to examine?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are like a corpse full of rottenness, corruption, and filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But many readers of the Psalms love David's expressions in asking God to judge him, examine him, try him, and test him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The New Testament term is this "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that we have been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this sense we are a corpse, unworthy of any kind of examination.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who has the boldness to ask God to come and examine him?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I dare not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was imprisoned by the invading Japanese army, I did not ask God, as David did, to judge me to see that I had walked in integrity or to examine me because I conducted myself in His truth Psa 26:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, I confessed my sins, shortcomings, wrongdoings, and defects to Him every day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should tell the Lord, "Lord, I am good for nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But thank You that You have crucified me on the cross, and in baptism I have been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now it should not be I who live, but You who live in me."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What a great difference there is between this expression according to the revelation of the New Testament and David's expressions in Psalm 26!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Who dares to pray, "God, come and judge me, examine me, try me, and test me"?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are we worthy for God to try us?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Within us are defects, shortcomings, wrongdoings, offenses, transgressions, trespasses, evils, iniquity, sin, sins, and defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times we are not right in our inward attitude toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, each day I have to make confession to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even before I speak in the meeting, I frequently pray, "Lord, forgive us and cleanse us with Your precious blood."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I do not confess my sins and my defilement, I cannot have a pure conscience with a strong spirit to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A. Standing on His Walk in Integrity and in Truth</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>to Be in the Favor of God's Lovingkindness</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>David was standing on his walk in integrity and in truth to be in the favor of God's lovingkindness Psa 26:1, 3, 11a .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This concept belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
