   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us read John 5:30, "I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From this verse we learn that it is the same with the Lord Jesus as it is with us in the self being expressed in the form of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, the Lord said here that He can of Himself do nothing; then He said that He does not seek His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From this we see that "myself" and "mine own will" are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His doing nothing of Himself means that He does not seek His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, it is clear that self is focused in the idea and opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Self is expressed in opinion, and opinion is the expression of self.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, if in a certain fellowship meeting concerning service a certain brother continually expresses his ideas and opinions, we cannot say that is sin, the world, or the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we will surely say that is self, because self expresses itself in opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A person who is full of ideas and opinions is full of self and the expression of self as well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now let us read Job 38:1-2, "Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Job chapters 3 through 37 are records of human words and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In these thirty-five long chapters Job and his three friends, and later Elihu, were talking, arguing and expressing their opinions continually.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, soon after they had completely expressed themselves, God came forth and rebuked them, saying, "Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After Job was enlightened by God, he said in 42:3-6, "Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth thee: wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At first Job spoke words without knowledge and expressed his own opinion, but at the end he abhorred himself and repented in dust and ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From this we see that Job's opinion is his self which he abhors.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His opinion is the expression of his self.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the whole Bible, the person who spoke the most was Job God afflicted him with circumstances and also arranged that he be surrounded by his four friends.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way all the words within him were drawn out.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He had his own opinions, his own ideas, and he did not yield to others' viewpoints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He felt that he had done no wrong and that there was no need for him to deal with sin, the world, or the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore he beat his chest, desiring to reason with the Righteous One.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Indeed the difficulty with Job was not sin, the world, or the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His difficulty was his self.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His unbroken self was a problem which prevented him from knowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many in the church are like Job; they have much to say.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, a sinning one, or one who loves the world, does not speak much, because he is aware of his mistakes and shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The conscience of all those who do wrong is defiled, and they cannot lift up their head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, they do not speak much and are easier to be helped and led.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But those who are of Job's type seemingly have no touch of sin, nor do they love the world; yet they are extremely self-righteous and always think they are right.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning the church and the things of God they have many opinions and ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, all day long they talk about this and that, and even speak of things they do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This kind of people is the most difficult to be helped and led; they cause others to feel incapable of helping them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A person who is full of self always brings many difficulties into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason for so many divisions in Christianity today is not only the sinfulness and worldliness of man, but more so the self of man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many people serve the Lord by helping brothers and sisters, yet in reality they want others to follow their ideas and opinions, their viewpoints and methods.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The result is many divisions in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Martin Luther said that within him there is a greater pope than the one in Rome himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the church, if self is not broken, every person is a pope, and everyone will become a division.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Besides Job in the Bible, Peter is also a model example of one who is full of self.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter's self was expressed to the uttermost because he was the most talkative one and had the most opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On many occasions in the Gospels Peter spoke and expressed his opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was not one subject concerning which he did not have an opinion or idea.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore each time the Lord dealt with him, He dealt with his opinion and idea.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The teaching of denying self in Matthew 16 was spoken because of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the night of His betrayal, the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Peter heard this, his self was immediately drawn out, and he said, "If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The result was that he denied the Lord three times and failed greatly Matt 26:31-33, 69-75 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was a real breaking and dealing for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But even after such a dealing, while the disciples were gathered together after the Lord's resurrection, it was again he who made a suggestion: he said, "I go a fishing" John 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was really one who girded himself and walked wherever he would John 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the New Testament, there is still another who represents self.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is Martha.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Each time she is mentioned in the Gospels, she is always talking and giving her opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John 11 most clearly depicts her characteristics many words and many opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We read there that her brother Lazarus died, and after four days the Lord Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When she saw the Lord, she blamed Him, saying, "If thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was her opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then the Lord said, "Thy brother shall rise again."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Martha said unto Him immediately, "I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This again was her explanation according to her own opinion of the words of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord replied, "I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Believest thou this?"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She answered and said, "I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What she answered was not what the Lord had asked; her comprehension of what the Lord had said was really remote.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After saying this, she did not care whether the Lord had finished speaking with her; she returned home and called her sister Mary secretly, saying, "The Teacher is here, and calleth thee."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This she fabricated on her own and made the decision for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now when they had come to the tomb, and Jesus requested that the stone be removed, Martha again offered her opinion, saying, "Lord, by this time he stinketh; for he hath been dead four days."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This story reveals Martha's opinion and viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She had so many opinions, which indicates that her self was very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>From these narratives relating to the people mentioned, we can clearly see that the expression of self is in the human thoughts and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, a person who is full of ideas and opinions is one who is full of self.</S>
