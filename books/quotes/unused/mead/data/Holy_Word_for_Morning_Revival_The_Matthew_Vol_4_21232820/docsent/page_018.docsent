   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 25:14-18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>14 For the kingdom of the heavens is just like a 1 man about to go 1 abroad, who called his own 2 slaves and delivered to them 3 his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>15 To one he gave five 1 talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his 2 own ability.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And he went abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>16 Immediately he who had received the five talents went and 1 traded with them and 2 gained another five.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>17 Similarly, he who had received the two gained another two.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>18 But he who had received the 1 one went off and 2 dug in the earth and 3 hid his master's money.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>14 1 The man here signifies Christ, who was about to go abroad, into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>14 2 Slaves signify believers viewed from the aspect of service 1 Cor 7:22-23; 2 Pet 1:1; James 1:1; Rom 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The believers' status in relation to Christ is of two aspects: in life they are virgins living for Him; in service, in work, they are His purchased slaves serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>14 3 His possessions signifies the church Eph 1:18 with all the believers, who constitute God's household 24:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>15 1 A talent, the largest unit of weight, was worth 6,000 denarii see note 7 1 in John 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the parable of the virgins, oil signifies the Spirit of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3-4 , whereas in this parable, talents signify spiritual gifts Rom 12:6; 1 Cor 12:4; 1 Pet 4:10; 2 Tim 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For life we need oil, the Spirit of God, even His filling, that we may be enabled to live the virgin life for the Lord's testimony; for service, for work, we need the talent, the spiritual gift, that we may be equipped as a good slave to accomplish what the Lord intends to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The filling of the Spirit in life enables us to use the spiritual gift in service work , and the spiritual gift in service matches the filling of the Spirit in life, that we may be a perfect member of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>15 2 Own ability signifies our natural ability, which is constituted of God's creation and our learning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>16 1 Traded with them talents signifies our using of the gift that the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>16 2 Gained another five talents signifies that the gift we received from the Lord has been used to the fullest extent, without any loss or waste.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>18 1 The main emphasis in this parable is on the one-talented one, who received the smallest gift.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is very easy for the least gifted to mistreat or ignore their gift.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>18 2 The earth signifies the world; thus, dug in the earth signifies becoming involved in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Any association, any involvement, with the world, even a little worldly talk, will bury the gift we have received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>18 3 Hid his master's money signifies rendering the Lord's gift useless, letting it lie waste under the cloak of certain earthly excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To make any excuse for not using the Lord's gift is to hide the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is always the danger with the one-talented ones, those who consider their gift to be the smallest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 14 says that the man gave his slaves his possessions, but verse 15 says that he gave them talents.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that the talents in verse 15 are the possessions in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord's possessions are in His hand, they remain His possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when they are delivered to us, they become our talents.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today the Lord's possessions primarily are the gospel, the truth, the believers, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do not care for these things, you will not have any talents.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not wait in an indifferent way for the Lord to give us something.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No, we must diligently seek the gospel and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to experience the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, we need to pray, "Lord, I want to take care of the saints and bear their burdens.</S>
