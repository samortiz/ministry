   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Unlimited Fullness of the Father</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians 1:19 speaks of the unlimited fullness of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>D. The Elements of James's Tremendous Lack</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are also elements of the tremendous lack in the Epistle of James.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>James's lack is not light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is tremendous.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without seeing a clear vision of God's eternal economy, without the all-inclusive Christ, without the all-inclusive Spirit, without the divine life that enables us even to reign over the things which are against God, without the all-inclusive power of the resurrection of Christ, and without the all-terminating cross of Christ, there is no possibility for anyone to live out Christian perfection Christian living .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the entire teaching of the New Testament, Christian perfection is produced by the believers with the rich element of all that Christ is, by the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive consummated Spirit, and through the power of Christ's resurrection and the death of Christ's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the termination of our natural life by the cross, we may have a kind of perfection not by self-denial but by self-cultivation, which is considered by most Christians as the genuine Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a Christian perfection is a pretense and is the product of the natural life endeavoring to develop the "bright virtue" in the man of God's old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is hard to discern how much the Christian perfection stressed by James implies these all-inclusive items in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the New Testament teaching, the Christian living should also eventually be for the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:15-16 , not merely for the believers' personal benefit and blessing, nor merely for them to glorify God in their excellent living and good conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The goal of God's New Testament economy is the Body of Christ for the consummation of the New Jerusalem , at which the Christian living, Christian perfection, should be aimed.</S>
