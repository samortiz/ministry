   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Concerning Spiritual Instruction</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He told us about going to Margaret Barber weekly, during his student days, to be rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At those times when there was nothing to rebuke, she would ask questions until some fault was found; then she would rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He said that through this means he received excellent spiritual instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On one occasion Watchman Nee was rebuked by an employee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This employee pointed his finger and pounded his fist, rebuking Watchman Nee for almost four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At one point, some neighbors who felt the employee was being unfair, stepped in to intervene.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But Watchman Nee sat calmly in his chair, holding a newspaper, without changing expression, as if nothing were happening.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At times while he was being rebuked, he would nod his head.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I saw that, I could not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now I know that he was receiving it as a discipline from God's hand and was submitting himself to this circumstance God had allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Frequently, Watchman Nee would suddenly lift up his eyes, look to heaven, and say, "He is God."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The implication was that every circumstance was under God's sovereign arrangement and that he was willing to receive it as such and to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Watchman Nee did not have the usual concept toward those who would inflict him with hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On one occasion he said, "The brothers who transgress are like little children who have fallen into a miry ditch.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Their clothes and hair are defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But give them a bath, and they will be clean again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the future all the brothers and sisters will be transparent precious stones in the New Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Chungking the brothers asked him to participate in the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, he would not partake of the bread or the cup; he simply sat and prayed silently.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His reason: "The problem in the church in Shanghai has not been resolved; therefore, I cannot break the bread here."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I asked him when he would resume his ministry, and he replied, "There is no possibility."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Concerning the Lord's leading for the work, Watchman Nee was very keen in his discernment and quick in making decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In explaining why this was so, he said, "If I am wrong, the Lord will use the wall and the donkey to stop me, as He did with Balaam."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This attitude indicates that Watchman Nee was one who always obeyed the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning the Christian Life</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On one occasion Watchman Nee instructed some of us, saying, "Christians must escape the system of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is more important to deal with the system than to deal with consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is useless to consecrate inside the system."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When asked whether it was permissible to play cards without betting money, he replied, "To the Christian there is no absolute right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It may be all right for one person to do a thing, but not all right for another person to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is right or wrong for a Christian depends upon the level of life he has attained; the level of life is reflected in how many things he cannot do."</S>
