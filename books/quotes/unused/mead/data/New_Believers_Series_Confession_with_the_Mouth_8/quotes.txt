[1]  CONFESSION WITH THE MOUTH Scripture Reading: Rom 10:10; Prov 29:25; Matt 10:32-33 I. THE IMPORTANCE OF CONFESSING WITH THE MOUTH
[2]  Once a person has believed in the Lord, he should not keep the matter a secret; he has to confess the Lord with his mouth.
[3]  Likewise, if a new believer does not confess the Lord immediately after he believes in the Lord, I am afraid he will be dumb for the rest of his life.
[4]  There is great profit when one confesses with his mouth after he has believed in his heart.
[5]  Suppose you do not open your mouth and say, "I have decided to follow the Lord Jesus; I am His now."
[6]  If you do not confess with your mouth, that is, if you are a Christian secretly, you will experience much more difficulty than those who are Christians openly.
[7]  In John 9 the Jews made a decision: Whoever confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue v. 22 . In chapter twelve the Bible says that many Jewish rulers believed in the Lord Jesus secretly, but they dared not confess Him because they were afraid of being put out of the synagogue v. 42 . Do you think that these people had peace in their hearts? Perhaps they felt uneasy about confessing the Lord, but they felt even more uneasy about not confessing the Lord.
[8]  If you want to wait until your behavior is good before you confess, you will lose both your chance of opening your mouth as well as your chance of having good behavior; both will be lost, and you will fail in both.
[9]  Some people dare not confess because they are afraid of men.
[10]  Many people can honestly say that they have no other reservation in their heart; they are willing to stand up and confess, but when they see the faces of others, they become afraid.
[11]  On the one hand, we have to realize that when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He bore our sins as well as our shame.
[12]  Why did the rulers in John 12 not confess the Lord?
[13]  They did not confess the Lord because they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
[14]  If people persecute you after you have confessed the Lord with your mouth, you should also say, "Lord, I thank You."
