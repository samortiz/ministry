   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE EIGHTEEN JEHOVAH'S DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR CHRIST TO BE THE KING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO BRING IN THE RESTORATION FOR ISRAEL Scripture Reading: Isa 32 35</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will consider chapters thirty-two through thirty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before we come to these chapters, I would like to say a word concerning the main thought of the book of Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The divine revelation in Isaiah concerns God's economy, to have Christ as the centrality and universality of God's great move.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's great move is a great wheel, having a hub, a rim, and spokes between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is the centrality the hub and the universality the rim with all the spokes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is everything in God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the main thought of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To understand the book of Isaiah, we need to have the view from the entire sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaiah is of two portions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first portion includes chapters one through thirty-nine, and the second portion includes chapters forty through sixty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah correspond to the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The last twenty-seven chapters correspond to the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The New Testament begins with John the Baptist Mark 1:1-3 , and Isaiah 40 also begins with John the Baptist v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first part of Isaiah concerns the chastisement of God's dear people and the punishment of the nations to bring in a turn among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To have a turn to fulfill God's purpose, we need to realize that we have been discharged, "fired," by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today, our practical God, our God in our daily living, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As descendants of Adam, as those created by God, we want to know God, worship Him, do His will, please Him, and fulfill the desire of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is right, for God wants us to be a good human being and one who fulfills His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God never planned or arranged in His eternal economy that we should do this by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He wants us to do it by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He wants us to let Him do it in us, by us, and through us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, as one who has been loving the Lord for many years, I can testify that the hardest thing for us Christians to overcome is our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God, however, does not want us to overcome our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should neither lose our temper nor try to overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, we need to resign, give up, have a turn from trying to overcome our temper, and let Christ come in to be the temper- overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The real spiritual turn is to resign from the position of one who is trying to be a proper human being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to resign from what we want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is Isaiah's thought and logic.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us now go on to see that, according to chapters thirty-two through thirty-five, Jehovah's destruction of the nations is for Christ to be the King to bring in the restoration for Israel.</S>
