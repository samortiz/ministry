   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ESSENCE OF OUR FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the purpose of Christ's works?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is to bring man to believe that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John 9 Christ gave sight to one who was born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Pharisees started another argument about this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They summoned the one who was healed and asked him all kinds of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After getting nothing out of his answers, they drove him out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later the Lord met him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He asked the healed person only one question: "Do you believe into the Son of God?" v. 35 . He answered, "Who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him?" v. 36 . "Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and He is the One speaking with you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And he said, Lord, I believe; and he worshipped Him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nothing is clearer than this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His work is just to bring men to realize who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He never let go of the fact that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the essence of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It declares that Jesus is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>ONLY THIS ONE POINT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we read the Gospel of John through, we will find that every passage concerns this one point: Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 10 the Jews surrounded Him and said, "How long will you hold our soul in suspense?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you are the Christ, tell us plainly" v. 24 . The question still hung on this one point.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How did Jesus answer?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said, "I told you, and you do not believe...You do not believe, because you are not of My sheep" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All who do not believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that He is God incarnated as a man, are not Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who do not recognize Him as the Son of God do not have the life of Christ in them; they are not His sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Upon this issue stands the whole basis of the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 11 Jesus said again, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live" v. 25 . Can a common mortal utter such words?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>GOD HINGES ON HIM</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In John 12 Jesus cried out aloud, "He who believes into Me does not believe into Me, but into Him who sent Me; and he who beholds Me beholds Him who sent Me. I have come as a light into the world, that every one who believes into Me would not remain in darkness" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>44-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You can see that the One who sent Him hinges on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To believe into Him is to believe into the One who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To see Him is to see the One who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The light also hinges on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be in the light is to believe into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everything hinges on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then in John 14 the Lord said, "Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me" v. 1 . He wants us to believe into Him in the same way that we believe into God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The one thing He always insists upon is the demand to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 15 speaks of some who hate the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He said, "He who hates Me hates My Father also" v. 23 . Once again He reveals that He and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>NOT BELIEVING IN HIM IS A SERIOUS SIN</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In John 16, the Lord said that one day the Holy Spirit would come and convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why concerning sin?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The explanation is in verse 9: "Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me," because they do not believe that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a sin, a very serious sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the Holy Spirit comes, He will convict men, and they will realize how serious a sin it is not to believe in Jesus being the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One further passage in the Gospel of John will suffice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>17:3: "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here we are shown what eternal life is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord's definition of eternal life is to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Believing in the eternal God and believing in His sent One Jesus Christ is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eternal life hinges upon this person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hope that we would all realize who Jesus of Nazareth is.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our faith does not have any empty doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is based on the fact that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To receive Jesus Christ is to receive God.</S>
