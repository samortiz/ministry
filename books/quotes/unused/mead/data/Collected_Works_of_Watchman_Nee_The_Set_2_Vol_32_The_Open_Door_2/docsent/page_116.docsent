   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Swatow, Kwangtung Province One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During May, the city of Swatow experienced several bombings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thank the Lord that all the brothers and sisters in the Lord are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the crisis, about thirty brothers and sisters remained in Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank the Father for His grace; all of them are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The incident gave us an opportunity to know God through our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We believe that God is our hiding place and a shelter for our life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>May all the glory go to Him forever, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Wen-kwang intends to travel by boat to Kulangsu.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Ge-chen left for the inland regions on June 21.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most of the brothers and sisters who were working at the steamship company or who were engaged in embroidery work have lost their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But thank the Lord that He has sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are able to get by for now.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not know what to do in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May the Lord grant us grace and open a way for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brothers in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hsie Tze-shun and Chen Fang-ching, August 3</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jien-Ou, Fukien Province</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Jie-dun has been here for two months.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He had overly exerted himself, and I asked him to come for a rest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lately, he has improved a little, but he is still weak and unable to bear any stress.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jien-Ou experienced a large-scale bombing on June 25 and the sixth of this month.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first time we were in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Over fifty people were listening to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Soon a fire spread in a wild way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were only a tree's distance from the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The leaves on the other side of the tree had already changed color.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet we were all safe and continued to break bread as usual.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second time the bombing came we were a few hundred feet from Small Pear Hill.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A house behind us received one bomb, and a large building received another bomb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The elementary school across the street received several bombs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Dust filled the air, and when we lifted up our heads, we found almost everything gone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet the amazing thing was that our house did not sustain any damage except some fallen roof shingles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The partition between the meeting room and the back room also fell.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the past we have complained that our room was not big enough for meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Brother Chen Ke-san was here for a conference, I asked the owner to allow us to tear down the partition so that we could add more chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The owner was a devout Buddhist, and he thought that it could not be removed because it had Buddhist images.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I could not do anything then.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank the Lord, He bombed the images away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The next day the owner removed everything, including the idols and ancestral plaques.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The front and back rooms spontaneously became one room, and the place was one-third larger.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We really thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord even moved the owner's heart to do some remodeling for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are safely living here.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can only say to the Lord, "We praise for the past, and we trust for the future!"</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>1 There are eight to nine saints who have moved to Ma-Yang-Chun in Kwang-Yeh-Li which is in the mountains, about fifty Chinese miles from Han-Jiang .</S>
