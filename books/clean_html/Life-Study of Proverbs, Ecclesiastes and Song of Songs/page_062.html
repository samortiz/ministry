<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. He Appreciating Her Beauty in Her Looking<br>
to Him with a Single Eye by the Spirit</H2>

<P>"Oh, you are beautiful, my love!/Oh, you are beautiful! Your eyes are like doves" (S.S. 1:15). He appreciates her beauty in looking to Him with a single eye by the Spirit (eyes like doves&#151;v. 15). The first striking aspect of our beauty in the sight of the Lord Jesus is our single eye toward Him. By the Spirit we look to Him with a single eye.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. She Appreciating His Beauty<br>
in His Pleasantness</H2>

<P>The Beloved and the lover appreciate each other. "Oh, you are beautiful, my beloved; indeed, pleasant!" (v. 16a). In this verse she appreciates His beauty in His pleasantness.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. She Humbly Realizing<br>
That She Is a Small Person</H2>

<P>"I am a rose of Sharon,/A lily of the valleys" (2:1). The word for rose in this verse refers to a wild rose, despised in the land of Judea. Here the lover humbly realizes that she is but a small person, living on the one hand a pretty but despised life (rose) in the common world (Sharon, meaning "plain"), and on the other hand a pure and trusting life (lily) in the low place (valleys). This was her humble recognition and realization regarding herself.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. He Appreciating Her as His Love<br>
Who Lives a Pure and Trusting Life</H2>

<P>"As a lily among thorns,/So is my love among the daughters" (v. 2). Here He appreciates her as His love (Shulammite) among the world-loving adulteresses (daughters&#151;James 4:4) who lives a pure and trusting life (lily) among the filthy and unbelieving people (thorns).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. She Appreciating Him as the Source<br>
of Rich Provision Who Supplies Her in a Timely Way</H2>

<P>"As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,/So is my beloved among the sons" (S.S. 2:3a). Here she appreciates Him as the source of rich provision (apple tree) who supplies her in a timely way. The lover and the Beloved both have beauty, and they appreciate the beauty in each other. This shows us that transformation produces a mutual appreciation between Christ and His lover.</P>
