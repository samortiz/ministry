For example, immediately after Joseph\u2019s brothers had cast him into the pit, a company of Ishmaelites appeared on the scene, and his brothers decided to sell him to them. Then Joseph was taken to Egypt and sold to Potiphar, Pharaoh\u2019s chamberlain. All this was under God\u2019s sovereignty. In fact, even Jacob\u2019s partiality toward Joseph was under God\u2019s sovereignty. In chapter thirty-seven God exercised His sovereignty to deal with this partiality so that Jacob might mature.

Ishmael was the son of Abraham by Hagar, and Midian was the son of Abraham by his last wife, Keturah. Both the Ishmaelites and the Midianites represent the flesh. Hatred is related to the flesh, and the flesh is connected to the world represented by Egypt. Due to his brothers\u2019 hatred, Joseph was handed over to the flesh, and the flesh brought him down to Egypt. But God is sovereign over all.

The territory around the Mediterranean Sea is the center of human culture, encompassing the Holy Land and even the garden of Eden, where our forefather Adam dwelt. The culture that came out of this region has endured for thousands of years. Approximately five hundred years ago, Columbus sailed to a new land, America. Even though America became strongly built up, it did not play a major role in the world prior to the Second World War. At the end of the First World War, the League of Nations was established in Geneva through the maneuvering of Great Britain with the help of France to put down Germany. However, it was effective only from 1920 to 1931, when Japan, a former member of the League, invaded Manchuria. A few years later, Italy under Mussolini invaded Ethiopia, and in 1939 Hitler deceived British Prime Minister Chamberlain and took over Czechoslovakia. Later in the same year, Hitler invaded Poland.
