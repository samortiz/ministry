[5]  A. The Unique Bible Being Consistent in Its Unique Revelation
[6]  According to His heart's desire, God made His eternal economy 1 Tim 1:4b; Eph 1:10; 3:9 to make man the same as He is in life and nature but not in His Godhead and to make Himself one with man and man one with Him, thus to be enlarged and expanded in His expression, that all His divine attributes may be expressed in human virtues.
[7]  This was all for Him to dispense Himself into His chosen people to regenerate them with Himself as their life for producing many sons many God-men 1 Pet 1:3 for the forming of the churches with His many sons and for the building up of the Body of Christ with His brothers as the members to be the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, consummating in the New Jerusalem as His eternal enlargement and expression.
[8]  THE TEN GREAT CRITICAL "ONES" FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST MESSAGE TWO ONE CHRIST THE UNSEARCHABLE ONE 1 OUTLINE Christ is the eternal and only begotten Son of God, the Second of the Divine Trinity John 1:1-2, 18; Matt 28:19.
[9]  He is, with the Father and the Spirit, the only God John 1:1; Rom 9:5; Heb 1:8.
[10]  He died an all-inclusive death through which He crucified Satan the old serpent John 3:14; Heb 2:14 sin Rom 8:3; John 1:29 , the world John 12:31 , the fallen man with his flesh Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20 , the old creation represented by the old fallen man , and the law with its ordinances Rom 10:4; Col 2:14; Eph 2:15 for the accomplishment of God's eternal redemption Heb 9:12 , and released His divine life from the shell of His humanity to be dispensed into His believers John 12:24; 3:15 .
[11]  He resurrected from among the dead Matt 28:6-7; 1 Cor 15:4b , and through His resurrection He in His humanity was designated to be the firstborn Son of God Rom 1:4; 8:29; Acts 13:33 , became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 , and regenerated with His resurrection life all the people chosen by God before the foundation of the world 1 Pet 1:2-3; Eph 1:4 .
[12]  Lord Jesus, we love You because You are the Word of God.
[13]  Christ lived in His humanity on the earth to express God for thirty-three and a half years He is God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .
[14]  Christ ascended to the heavens, and in His ascension He was crowned and enthroned to be the Lord of all men and all things to rule over the whole universe Acts 10:36 , the Christ the Anointed of God to accomplish God's economy Acts 2:36 , and the Ruler of the kings of the earth Rev 1:5 to arrange the situations of the world and the environment of God's chosen people that they may be saved by Him as the Savior who will be received by all His believers as their everything Acts 5:31 .
[15]  In His ascension Christ is also the Head of the church to take care of the church as His Body Eph 1:22-23; 5:29-30 , the Paraclete in heaven before God to take care of all the cases and needs of His members 1 John 2:1 , and the One who is realized by His Spirit as the Paraclete in His members John 14:16-20 .
[16]  THE TEN GREAT CRITICAL "ONES" FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST MESSAGE THREE ONE CHRIST THE UNSEARCHABLE ONE 2 OUTLINE He is the Shepherd of God's flock, the door for them to come out of Judaism, and the pasture for them to feed on John 10:11, 14, 16, 9.
[17]  You have gathered us again together around You as the Spirit and around Your Word as life.
[18]  In the previous message, we saw Christ from eternity, through creation, and through His incarnation, His human living, His all-inclusive death, His resurrection, and His ascension.
[19]  THE TEN GREAT CRITICAL "ONES" FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST MESSAGE FOUR ONE SPIRIT ONE APPLICATION OUTLINE The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Third of the Divine Trinity Gen 1:2; Rom 8:9; 1 Cor 2:11; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14.
[20]  He was the Spirit of God from eternity and the Holy Spirit at the time of Christ's incarnation Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 , but He was not "the Spirit" before the resurrection of Christ John 7:39 .
[21]  He applies all that the Triune God is in Christ, all that the all-inclusive Christ is, and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained to all the people whom God has chosen; thus He became the one divine application: He sanctifies, separates, God's chosen people from the fallen people of the world and leads them to repent to God and receive Christ 1 Pet 1:2.
[22]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You have gathered us together around You as the all-inclusive compound Spirit.
[23]  After the church was established and became degraded, as the life-giving and compound Spirit, He became the seven Spirits of God; that is, He is the one life-giving, compound Spirit but is intensified sevenfold Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .
[24]  Furthermore, as the Spirit of life, He was breathed into the believers by Christ, in the night of His resurrection, as the gentle breath to be their indwelling Spirit to fill them inwardly John 20:22; Acts 13:52 .
[25]  The Spirit also seals the believers with all that Christ is and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained, thus dispensing all the divine elements of Christ into the very being of the believers until they will be redeemed in their body, that is, transfigured to be like the glorious body of Christ Eph 1:13; 4:30; 2 Cor 1:22; Rom 8:23; Phil 3:21 .
[26]  As the flow of God John 7:38 , He transmits in His fellowship the grace of Christ, the element of the divine life, with the love of God, the source of the grace of Christ 2 Cor 13:14 .
[27]  THE TEN GREAT CRITICAL "ONES" FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST MESSAGE FIVE ONE LIFE ONE ELEMENT, ONE SALVATION ONE WAY OF SAVING, AND ONE KIND OF LIVING ONE MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST OUTLINE One life one element: The life of the Triune God embodied in Christ Eph 4:18.
[28]  This life is the divine element of the Triune God and Christ: God gives His chosen people repentance unto this life and has appointed, ordained, them to receive this life Acts 11:18; 13:48.
[29]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your oracle, Your speaking in Your recovery for the past more than seventy years.
[30]  The one life, Christ's life, the eternal life, is for our salvation, and this is the one way of saving.
[31]  THE TEN GREAT CRITICAL "ONES" FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST MESSAGE SIX ONE TESTIMONY ONE EXPRESSION, ONE BODY ONE ORGANISM, AND ONE CITY ONE CONSUMMATION OUTLINE One testimony one expression: Christ is the faithful Witness of God testifying in His human living what God is Rev 1:5; 3:14.
[32]  The believers are the witnesses of Christ for the spreading of His gospel Acts 1:8: Testifying the human living of Christ Acts 10:37-39a.
[33]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You that for so many decades Your word has never been rare among us; rather, Your revelation has come to us again and again.
[34]  The one expression of Christ is in the unique move of the unique God for the unique accomplishment of His unique economy Eph 1:10; 1 Tim 1:4b and in the unique blending in the unique life of Christ for His unique testimony in the universe 1 Cor 12:24 .
[35]  ONE CITY ONE CONSUMMATION The Holy City, New Jerusalem
[36]  The holy city New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the work for God's new creation out of God's old creation through all the four ages of man's history the age before the law, the age of law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom , from God's making the spirit for man and putting man in front of the tree of life to the accomplishment of this city for the good pleasure of His will, which is the intent of His eternal economy.
[37]  In its humanity it is the tabernacle of God the dwelling place of God among men who is the unique King reigning over the entire new heaven and new earth , and in its divinity it is the temple of God the dwelling place of God's redeemed people serving Him as a royal priestly family who are the kings reigning over the nations around the New Jerusalem in eternity .
[38]  Its supply is the tree of life, signifying the all-inclusive Christ of life, growing on the two banks of the river of the water of life 22:2 and the river of the water of life, signifying the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit, flowing from the throne of the Lamb-God 22:1a .
