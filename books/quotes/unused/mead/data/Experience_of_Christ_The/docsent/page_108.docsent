   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REMAINING IN THE DEATH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many brothers and sisters have been baptized into Christ's death, but they do not remain in death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I can tell by the expression on their faces that they have come out of death, for it is obvious that they are not at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everyone who remains in death is at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we remain in death, we shall be able to say, "I don't have problems with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am simply resting here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether others appreciate me or rebuke me, I am not disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather I am at rest."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason there is conflict between a husband and wife is that they so often come out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By leaving death, they lose their rest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some brothers and sisters may come all the way out of death, whereas others may have one foot in death and one foot outside death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When they go back into death, they are at rest, but when they come out, they lose their rest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may remain in death, but instead of lying down in it, they stand up and try to get out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Still others may lie down in death; however, they are only partly at rest because as they lie there, they are desiring to leave death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only those who fully rest in death actually remain in Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These can say, "Praise the Lord that I have been baptized into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am content to stay here."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE CYCLE OF DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who remain in death know the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As they lie restfully in death, they have the experience of Philippians 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They know Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are also conformed to Christ's death like dough conformed to a mold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From now on, we should not only be in Christ's death, but also be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we are conformed to His death, the more we know the power of His resurrection; and the more we know the power of His resurrection, the more we are conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is in this way that we pass through the process of resurrection that leads to the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more death there is, the more resurrection; and the more resurrection, the more death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a cycle that moves like a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the Christian life and also the Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We live and walk by this cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This cycle begins, not with resurrection, but with death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are you ignorant of the fact that as many of us as have been baptized into Christ have been baptized into His death?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Being baptized into the death of Christ is the beginning of the cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through this experience of death, resurrection power rises up within us to bring us into deeper death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After we enter deeper into death, more resurrection power rises up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way the cycle continues from death to resurrection and from resurrection to death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, we shall arrive at the outstanding resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That will be the time of our maturity, the time when we are ready for rapture and the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The redemption of the body is the last step of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When our physical body enters into resurrection, it will be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That will be the full maturity of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Christian life is a matter of dying to live.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We die so that we may live.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there is no death, there can be no life, no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more death we have, the more resurrection we experience; and the more resurrection we have, the more death we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the cycle that is gradually bringing us to maturity until we arrive at the outstanding resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the Christian life.</S>
