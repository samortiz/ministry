   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Antioch</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church in Antioch was also part of the story of the church s spreading Acts 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Antioch there were five prophets and teachers, of whom the first was Barnabas, a Levite.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Levites were not ordinary Jews but the Jews of the Jews, because the Jewish religion was in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Levites served God exclusively.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second person was Simeon, who was called Niger.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Niger means black and denotes a man of the black race, probably of African origin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among those five prophets and teachers, there was a black man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The third was Lucius the Cyrenian.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Cyrene is in northern Africa, so Lucius was an African; however, he was not necessarily a black man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fourth was Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch; Manaen was a noble, and not necessarily a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The last one was Paul, who was a Pharisee trained at the feet of Gamaliel and who zealously kept all the ordinances in Judaism 22:3 ; therefore, his Jewish concept was very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though Barnabas was a Levite, Paul s original Jewish concept may have been deeper than that of Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church in Antioch there were no distinctions; all these people were not merely in the church but were leaders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among them were Jews and Gentiles and people of different races; the church in Antioch was a church without divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is something that only the Holy Spirit could have accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church in Antioch was more fully formed than the situation in the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church in Jerusalem is not the pattern; the church in Antioch is the real pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church in Antioch had completely left all the Jewish influence behind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through such a church the Holy Spirit was able to move forward to spread without any limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Cyprus</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The good situation in Antioch, however, was still not enough, so the Holy Spirit came and sent forth Barnabas and Paul to the work; their goal was the spreading of the church 13:2-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can see the spread of the church by tracing the footsteps of these apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After being sent out by the Holy Spirit, the apostles went to Seleucia and from there they sailed to the island of Cyprus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This Cyprus is the island of Cyprus today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then they went to Asia Minor, which was a place of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even though Cyprus was a Gentile place, the apostles used Jewish synagogues to preach the word when they first arrived v. 5 . The presence of these synagogues shows God s preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before the Lord Jesus was born, God scattered Jews all over the earth, and in every place that there were Jews, they built social organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their social organization was centered around the synagogues, just as it centered around the temple in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every Sabbath there would be people in the synagogues studying the Bible; the Jews also brought Gentiles to hear the name of God and to meet the true God, the Creator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who fear God, as spoken of in Acts 13:16, were Gentiles who were seeking God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God prepared all of this ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the apostles went out to the Gentile lands, they would go first to the Jewish synagogues and use them to preach the gospel to God s Old Testament elect; then they would turn from the Jews to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At this time, the spread of the church was very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we read the book of Acts, we should draw a map, and whenever we come to a place, we should fill in its name and note on which trip the apostle visited it; furthermore, we should study the spiritual characteristics of each place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This will be a big help to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Asia Minor</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the apostle Paul s first trip to preach the gospel to the Gentiles and to establish churches among them, he went to Cyprus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not stay there long before continuing on to Asia Minor, which is modern-day Turkey.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Asia Minor he established many local churches, which represents a further step in the spread of the church Acts 13 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the beginning, even though the apostles preached the gospel to the Gentiles, they were still among the Jews; therefore, at the end of Acts 13 it says that they turned to the Gentiles v. 46 . This shows that even though they were in Gentile lands in Asia Minor, they were still preaching to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Beginning in chapter 13, the apostles shook off the dust of their feet v. 51 as a formal sign that they were turning to the Gentiles in the Gentile land.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the church did not only spread in Gentile lands but also to Gentile people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In chapter 14 the universal church finally was fully formed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we read Acts carefully, we can see the Holy Spirit s intention to spread the church, not only geographically but also to different races.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the Lord s recovery came to Taiwan and churches were established, we spontaneously hoped that the gospel would be preached among the local people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the spreading of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the one hand, the church spread from the Jewish lands to Gentile regions, and on the other hand, it spread from the Jewish people to the Gentile people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the time of Paul s first ministry journey, the spreading of the church was very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, the spreading in the Gentile regions laid the foundation for the church throughout history.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The last portion of the Bible speaks of seven epistles to the seven churches in Asia Minor Rev 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These seven churches represent the church throughout the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Later, the apostles returned to Antioch, and at that time there were no problems in the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They could only declare the things that God had done with them and that God had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles Acts 14:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church spread, many walls were broken down, and the church became universal.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the matter of geography, the church is universal; in the matter of race, the church is also universal.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, Jerusalem was still a problem, and some came from Jerusalem with the intention of making the church into a church of the Jews; they wanted to bring Jewish things into the church 15:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If people limit the way of the church or the spread of the church, they will miss a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In contrast, any person or place that allows the church to have a way will receive a special blessing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must be saved from all the problems within us to allow the church to spread continually without any limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Europe</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After Paul separated from Barnabas vv.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>35-39 , he went out on his second ministry journey.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Paul originally thought that he would work in the region of Asia Minor, but the Holy Spirit gave him a vision and wanted him to go to Macedonia, which is in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, he established several local churches in Macedonia 16:6 18:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The first church that Paul established in Macedonia was in Philippi 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Of all the churches in Macedonia, Philippi was the healthiest and the best; the next best was the church in Thessalonica 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although the church in Ephesus was good, it did not compare with the churches in Philippi and Thessalonica.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After Thessalonica, the apostle Paul went on to Berea v. 10 , to Athens v. 15 , and then to Corinth 18:1 . Thus, the gospel was preached to Europe, and several local churches were established there.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul then passed through Ephesus v. 19 on his way back to Antioch v. 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul remained in Antioch for some time and then went out a third time to preach the word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In principle, there was not much spreading on his third ministry journey, after which he went to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He may have wanted to go to Antioch, but before he was able to make the trip, he was arrested by the Jews in Jerusalem 22:27-30 .</S>
