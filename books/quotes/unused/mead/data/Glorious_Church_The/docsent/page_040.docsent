   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6 There is one more proof.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 17 says, "And the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the man-child, who was born of the woman, was caught up to the throne, a remnant of her seed still remained upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This could not be Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, this remnant keeps the commandments of God and has the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is all right to say that the nation of Israel kept the commandments of God, but to say that the nation of Israel held the testimony of Jesus would mix the Old Testament with the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In conclusion, it is impossible for this woman to be Mary or the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who then is this woman?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Old Testament shows that only one woman encountered the serpent Eve in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the New Testament there is also only one woman who encounters the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see the correspondence and correlation of the Scriptures, the beginning with the end. Furthermore, God particularly points out that the great dragon is the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that He is referring to the serpent who had been mentioned once before.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God makes the point clear that it was that one and only old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The emphasis is on the word "the" the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the woman mentioned here must also be that woman.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The sun, moon, and stars mentioned in Genesis 1 are mentioned in Revelation 12 in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the serpent was in Genesis 3, so the serpent is here also.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seed of the woman mentioned in Genesis 3 is also mentioned here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, the travail of birth is in Genesis 3, and it is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we put these two portions of Scripture together, we can surely see that the woman in Revelation 12 is the woman whom God purposed in His eternal will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything that will happen to her at the end time is clearly stated here.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The woman in Genesis 2 speaks of God's eternal purpose; the woman in Ephesians 5 speaks of the position and future of the church; and the woman in Revelation 12 reveals the things at the end time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In addition to these three women, there is another woman who shows forth the things in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the woman appeared in the vision, the Scriptures pointed out firstly that she was "clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars" 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These facts are very meaningful in reference to the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1 The woman was clothed with the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sun refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Her being clothed with the sun means that when the sun shines the brightest, it is shining upon her.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this present age, God is revealing Himself through her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows her relationship with Christ and the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>2 The woman had the moon underneath her feet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This phrase "underneath her feet" does not mean that she is treading upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Greek, it means that the moon is subject at her feet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The light of the moon is a reflecting light; it has no light of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the things in the age of the law merely reflected the things in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The law was but a type.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The temple and the ark were types.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The incense, the showbread in the Holy Place, and the sacrifices offered by the priests were all types, as well as the blood of the sheep and oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The moon underneath the feet of the woman means that all things pertaining to the law are subordinate to her.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This speaks of her relationship to the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>3 The woman had a crown of twelve stars upon her head.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The chief figures in the age of the patriarchs were from the time of Abraham to the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The crown of twelve stars upon her head speaks of her relationship to the age of the patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way, we see that the woman is not only related to the age of grace, but also to the age of the law and the age of the patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, she is more closely related to the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She includes all the saints in the age of grace, as well as all the saints from the ages of the law and the patriarchs.</S>
