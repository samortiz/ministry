 <h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT WITNESSING WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The third verse concerning the two spirits is Romans 8:16. This verse says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&rdquo; Here we see that the divine Spirit witnesses with our human spirit. Many times these two spirits talk to each other. Our spirit may say, &ldquo;God is my Father,&rdquo; and the divine Spirit will say, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; The divine Spirit may say, &ldquo;You are a child of God,&rdquo; and our spirit will say, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all need to become thoroughly familiar with these three verses on the two spirits. Remember, in John 3:6 our spirit is born of the Spirit; in John 4:24, our spirit worships the Spirit; and in Romans 8:16, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. These three verses are virtually all-inclusive. In John 3:6 we are reborn, in John 4:24 we digest God and enjoy Him, and in Romans 8:16 we walk with God, live by God, and are one with God in our being. This is the Christian life, the Christian living. We live by the divine Spirit in our spirit by enjoying the divine Spirit through our spirit and by walking in our spirit in our daily living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAST ADAM BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (Gk.). The last Adam is Christ in the flesh, the Lamb of God who took away our sins. Christ was the Word, God Himself (John 1:1). This Word became flesh, becoming the Lamb of God to take away our sins (John 1:14, 29). After taking away our sins through His death, this last Adam became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus has taken two great steps. In the first step He became flesh, and in the second step He became the life-giving Spirit. Originally He was merely God. Then He took the first step, incarnation, to become the flesh for our redemption. After completing the work of redemption, in resurrection He took the second step to become the life-giving Spirit. Thus, the first step was for redemption, and the second was for the giving of life.</p>
<p>Most Christians know only the first step. They are totally unaware of the second. How pitiful! Some today even oppose any mention of the second step. When we tell them that the Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit, they say, &ldquo;This is heretical. The Lord Jesus is only the Son. As the Son, He cannot be the Spirit. Why do you say that He is the life-giving Spirit?&rdquo; But the Bible clearly reveals that our Lord Jesus has taken two steps: the first step to become the flesh to take away our sins and the second step to become the life-giving Spirit to impart life into us. We once were poor, fallen people. We did not have life, but we had a great many sins. In order to save us, the Lord Jesus had to pass through these two steps. In the first step He shed His blood for us to take away our sins. Then, in the second step, He became the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life. Hallelujah, our sins are gone and life is here! The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. Our Redeemer today is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.&rdquo; No doubt, the Lord here is Jesus Christ. Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ is the Spirit who gives life. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberation. How wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO SPIRITS BECOMING ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 6:17 is a marvelous verse: &ldquo;He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Here we see that these two spirits have joined to become one spirit. How profound! Have you ever realized that you can be one spirit with the Lord? If we saw this fact, we would be beside ourselves. We would say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, I am one spirit with the Lord! I don&rsquo;t care about my temper or about Satan. I don&rsquo;t care about the demons, the scorpions, the snakes, or all the little &lsquo;bugs.&rsquo; I am one spirit with the Lord.&rdquo; We may need to tell those we meet, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me! I&rsquo;m too great! I&rsquo;m one spirit with the Lord!&rdquo; If you see the fact that you are one spirit with the Lord, the demons will be terrified. There is no need to have a long face and a wrinkled brow. You need to see that you are one spirit with the Lord. If you saw this, you could never have a long face again. Rather, your face would be shining. Do you truly believe this verse? If you did, could you still be cold and silent? No, you would be beside yourself, shouting praises to the Lord and even jumping out of your seat. What could be higher or greater than being one spirit with the Lord? How wonderful it is to be one spirit with Him!</p>
