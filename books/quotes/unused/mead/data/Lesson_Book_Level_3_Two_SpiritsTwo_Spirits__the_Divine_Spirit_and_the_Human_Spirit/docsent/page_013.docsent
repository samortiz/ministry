   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE COMPOUNDED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible is truly a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who say that the Bible is not the Word of God have surely never seen the wonderful picture of the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this picture we can more clearly understand why in John 7:39 the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before the Lord's incarnation, human living, crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God was not a compound; He had merely divinity, nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But now, the Spirit is no longer merely the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this all-inclusive Spirit we enjoy God, the uplifted humanity of Jesus, the sweetness of the death of Christ, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of the resurrection of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Certainly compounding is a process.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever something is compounded, it passes through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hallelujah, today we do not have a Spirit simply composed of divinity alone, but the all-inclusive Spirit compounded with divinity, the humanity of Jesus, the death of Christ, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By our experience we can testify that God, the humanity of Jesus, the effective death of Christ, and the powerful resurrection of Christ are all in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the Spirit of God compounded with Christ s humanity, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have covered many points in this lesson.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Few Christians have realized the matter of the compound Spirit.</S>
