<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LIVING IN THE DIVINE TRINITY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 14:19-20; 6:57b-58; Gal. 5:25; Phil. 1:20-21a; Gal. 2:20c; Phil. 1:19; Gal. 6:18</H1><P>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning our living in the Divine Trinity. When we use the word living, we mean abiding. Living in the Divine Trinity is abiding in the Divine Trinity. To abide is not merely to remain, to stay, but to dwell, to have our home in a place. Our abiding in the Divine Trinity includes our entire living, our daily walk. Thus, to abide in the Triune God is to dwell in the Triune God, to have our home in the Triune God, to live in the Triune God. The Triune God is embodied in the Son, and the Son as the embodiment of the Triune God with all His members is the organism of the Divine Trinity to produce fruit for the expression of the Triune God. As we abide, live, in the Triune God, we bear fruit for His expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIVING BY THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</H2><P>Our living in the Divine Trinity is wrapped up with the resurrected Christ. Before Christ's resurrection transpired, no one could live in the Triune God. Our Christ is the resurrected Christ, the pneumatic Christ. John 6 unveils to us how Christ was processed to become the resurrected Christ to indwell us. The outline from the Recovery Version can be a great help to us in seeing this revelation. The outline tells us that verses 32 through 71 show that Christ is the food abiding to eternal life. To become our food, Christ was first incarnated. Verses 32 through 51a show the incarnation of Jesus. Jesus as the food abiding to eternal life was incarnated.</P><P>Verses 51b through 55 show that Jesus was slain, because the shedding of blood is indicated. In verse 54 the Lord speaks of eating His flesh and drinking His blood. When blood is separate from flesh it indicates death. Furthermore, His blood has become drinkable, and His flesh has become eatable. This also indicates His being slain.</P><P>Verses 56 through 59 show that Christ was resurrected to indwell. In verse 56 the Lord said, "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him." This indicates that the Lord had to be resurrected that He might abide in us as our life and life supply. In verse 57 He said, "As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me." "Because of" indicates the factor. We live because we have a living factor which supports us to live. This factor is the resurrected Christ. Christ, the One who was slain and resurrected, can be the very living factor by which we live. We eat Him and live because of Him, the resurrected One. Our living because of Him means that He is the factor of our living.</P>
