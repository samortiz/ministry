   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 To Live Not to Ourselves but to Him</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Corinthians 5:14-15 the apostle Paul puts together Christ s constraining love with our living to Him, indicating that because we love Christ, we live to Him, not to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is quite meaningful that in verse 15 Paul does not say, No longer live for themselves but for Him ; rather, he says, No longer live to themselves but to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Living to the Lord is deeper in significance than living for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Living for the Lord implies that I and the Lord are still two; living to the Lord indicates that I am one with the Lord, as the wife is one with the husband in married life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To live to the Lord means that we are under the Lord s direction and control and that we desire to fulfill His requirements, satisfy His desires, and complete what He intends.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Worldly people live to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the love of Christ constrains us to live to Him and not to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To live to ourselves means that we are under our own control, direction, and governing and that we care for our own aims and goals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is to live not only for ourselves; it is to live to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the apostles had the single ambition of pleasing the Lord by living to Him v. 9 . They were absolutely under the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were under His direction, control, and governing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everything they did was to fulfill the Lord s purpose and desire.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As such persons, they did not live to the law, to themselves, or to anything other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul did not live to himself but to his Master, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was different from the rabbis who lived to the law and did everything with a view to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul s only aim was to please his Master.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul sought to please the Lord not by doing a work but by living to Him in every aspect of his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, we should not seek to please ourselves but seek to please the Lord by living to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All that we do must be to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since we are to the Lord, our time and money are also to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nothing is for ourselves, because none of us lives to himself but to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, if we consider the context, we will see that to live to the Lord in 5:15 means to live the kind of life the Lord Jesus lived.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter 4 we see that the apostles experienced the putting to death of Jesus v. 10 . When we experience the putting to death of Jesus, we can live the kind of life Jesus lived.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is to live to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To live to the Lord is to live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is to live in such a way that the outward man is always put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus lived this kind of life, and those who live such a life today are living to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This understanding of living to the Lord is according to the concept conveyed in chapter 4.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christians often try to live for the Lord according to their own concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may do many things for the Lord instead of to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What the Lord wants is not that we be so active for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He wants us to experience the putting to death of Jesus so that our natural man and our active being may be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many are active or aggressive for the Lord in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do things for Him by their natural aggressiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This offends the Lord, and it distracts us from enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, what we need is to be constrained by the Lord s love simply to live to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we would live to the Lord, we must deny our outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The outward man is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we live to Christ, we do not live by our outward man, by our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that living to Christ requires that we live by our inward man, by our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Living to Christ in 2 Corinthians 5:15 is equal to walking according to the spirit in Romans 8:4.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Anyone Who Is in Him Being a New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second Corinthians 5:17 says, So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is of God through our faith in Christ 1 Cor 1:30; Gal 3:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The old creation includes the heavens, the earth, billions of items, and mankind, but the new creation includes only the chosen and redeemed people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s people once were the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But when Christ as the life-giving Spirit entered into us, we were germinated with the Triune God to become the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The new creation was created by God with Christ as the embodiment of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, the material for the new creation is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation because God s life has entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before our regeneration we did not have the divine life, but through regeneration God imparted Himself into us and became our life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, we became the embodiment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He has been born into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way we have become a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The new creation is actually the old creation transformed by the divine life, by the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The old creation is old because God is not part of it; the new creation is new because God is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We who have been regenerated by the Spirit of God are still God s creation, but we are now His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, this is real only when we live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whenever we live and walk by the flesh, we are in the old creation, not in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we would be in the new creation, we must enter into an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Apart from such a union we shall remain in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But now, by the organic union with the Triune God, we are in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As believers in Christ, we are the new creation through an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In Adam we were born into the old creation, but in Christ we were regenerated into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Old Things Having Passed Away</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>and Having Become New</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Second Corinthians 5:17 goes on to say, The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The old things of the flesh have passed away through the death of Christ, and all has become new in Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The words behold, they have become new are a call to watch the marvelous change of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The word they in verse 17 refers to the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature; however, the new creation, composed of the believers born again of God, does have the divine life and nature John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, the believers are a new creation, not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life.</S>
