   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE BRANDS OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word brands in verse 17 refers to the marks branded on slaves to indicate their owners.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With Paul, a slave of Christ Rom 1:1 , physically the brands were the scars of his wounds received in his faithful service to his Master 2 Cor 11:23-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Spiritually, they signify the characteristics of the life he lived, a life like that lived by the Lord Jesus when He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such a life is continually crucified John 12:24 , doing the will of God John 6:38 , seeking not its own glory but the glory of God John 7:18 , and submissive and obedient to God, even unto the death of the cross Phil 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul followed the pattern of the Lord Jesus, bearing the brands, the characteristics of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this he was absolutely different from the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul considered himself a slave of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just as a slave might bear a brand mark testifying that he belonged to a certain owner, Paul bore in his body the brands of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was as if the name of Christ had been branded upon him again and again as a testimony and declaration that Paul belonged to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul had been wounded many times because of his faithfulness in service to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 2 Corinthians 11:24 and 25 he tells us that five times he received forty stripes save one, that three times he was beaten with rods, and that once he was stoned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, there were many scars on his body testifying of his years of service to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These scars may also be considered the brands of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we have already indicated, the spiritual significance of the expression the brands of Jesus is that Paul lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He took the lead to live such a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we read the four Gospels, we see the portrait of a Man constantly living a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This kind of life is a brand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He bore such a brand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was persecuted, ridiculed, despised, and rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, He did not say anything to defend Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, living a crucified life, He bore a brand to show that He belonged to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul followed the Lord Jesus to live this kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Philippians 3:10 he refers to the fellowship of His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As one who lived in the fellowship of Jesus sufferings, Paul bore the brands of Jesus as the sign that he lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Paul was greeting the Galatians with a word of peace, he was reminded of the fact that it was the brands of Jesus that kept him in this peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because he was persecuted, despised, ridiculed, rejected, and condemned, he could truly say that he bore the brands of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although we do not presume to classify ourselves with Paul, we can say truly that, at least to some extent, we also are bearing the brands of Jesus, for we are ridiculed, mocked, despised, criticized, and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many evil things are written about us and spoken concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As long as we continue to take the way of the cross, we shall be opposed in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are faithful to live a crucified life, opposition will rise up again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Galatians 4:29 Paul said, But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit, so also it is now.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This word indicates clearly that those who are according to the flesh will persecute those who are according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as the Lord Jesus and Paul were persecuted because they lived a crucified life, the same will happen to us if, by the Lord s mercy and grace, we follow their footsteps to live such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we are despised, rejected, condemned, ridiculed, and mocked, we bear the brands of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, because we bear these brands, we enjoy peace, and we are not troubled by any situation or circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I believe that as Paul was writing about peace, he had the sense deep within that he was maintained in peace because he bore the brands of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In principle, our experience today is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not think that those who criticize, persecute, and ridicule us have peace deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the Lord can testify for us that, in spite of opposition and ridicule, we enjoy a deep inward peace, the peace which comes with the assurance that we are taking the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This kind of persecution is an indication that we are those born according to the Spirit, not according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who persecute others and mock them surely are children according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should have a positive outlook concerning the persecution which comes because we take the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we are persecuted, we should praise the Lord and thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are not Ishmael mocking Isaac; we are Isaac being mocked by Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are accused of being a cult and of propagating heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many false accusations have been made against us in print.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, I can testify that in the midst of all this, I am at peace and sleep well every night.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Bearing the brands of Jesus keeps us in a peaceful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, this opposition and persecution indicate that we are on the right track with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you check with your experience, you will see that the more you are persecuted for following the Lord Jesus, the happier you are inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to Acts 5:40 and 41, the disciples rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Persecution gives us the assurance that we are taking the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, as Paul says in Galatians 6:16, there should be peace on all those who walk by this rule.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How do we know we are walking by this rule?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We know it by the fact that we are persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we were not walking by this rule, there would be no reason for persecution to come.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even though Paul did not offend anybody, he was persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Persecution came simply because of Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The persecution Paul faced was a sign that he was in the center of God s economy and that he was one with the Lord Jesus, the persecuted One.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, he could have assurance and enjoy peace.</S>
