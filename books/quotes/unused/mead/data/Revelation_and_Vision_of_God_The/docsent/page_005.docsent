   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE FIRST POINT OF THE VISION CONCERNING THE DIVINE TRINITY A. The Revelation in the Bible the Father, the Son, and the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My burden is not to give you lessons one after another; rather, my burden is to give you a secret so that you will have something to apply when you go out to preach the gospel by door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The secret is the revelation and vision of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beginning with this message we will use one scene after another to speak about the revelations of God and explain the visions that we have seen therein.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible contains God's revelations, but you need to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once you see them, they become visions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first scene of the revelation in the Bible is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Christianity was first brought to China, the missionaries translated their biblical knowledge and some theological doctrines into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was not an easy task in those early days.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible does not have the expression the Triune God; the earliest Chinese translation of the term Trinity was san-wei-i-t'i, that is, "three persons, one substance."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, before we speak about the revelation of the Triune God, we need to know the history of the development of Christianity in China.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Doctrine of "Three Persons, One Substance" in Chinese Christian Theology</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In A.D. 431 the Council of Ephesus condemned the sect of Nestorius as heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, this sect gained many believers in Syria and was protected by the Persian Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the seventh century, during the Tang Dynasty, Nestorianism spread into China.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the same time, it spread also to southern India and became the origin of Christianity in India.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The missionaries who brought Nestorianism to China concentrated their activities mostly in the region of Sian, the capital at that time, and they preached primarily to the officials and scholars.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nestorianism was received by several emperors, and a number of temples were built.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today there is still a Nestorian tablet with an inscription that contains the phrase ch'ing feng, which literally means "clear breeze," denoting the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This implies that Nestorianism did not have much knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later, the flourishing of Buddhism influenced some of the emperors who prohibited the activities of Nestorianism and destroyed its temples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, due to its lack in truth and life, Nestorianism vanished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the sixteenth century during the Ming Dynasty, Catholicism spread to China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Catholics rendered the Holy Spirit as the Holy God and rendered God as the Lord of Heaven; this brought in some difficulties in translation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, the Western missionaries went to the Orient.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Generally, the translations put out by the various denominations were about the same, and even some of the expressions were the same as those used in Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was then that the term Trinity was translated into Chinese as san-wei-i-t'i, which literally means "three persons, one body substance ."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was born, educated, and reared in Christianity, and I also memorized the doctrine of san-wei-i-t'i.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet I did not understand what it was all about, nor did I know whether the word t'i refers to a group of people as a corporate body, to the physical body, or to a body with a shape.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1958 while I was traveling in Greece, I saw a painting in an Eastern Orthodox Church of a man with a body and three heads who looks like a monster.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I saw that, I felt that it corresponds with the phrase "three persons, one body" that I read in my youth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Until this day I still do not fully understand what the phrase "three persons, one body" refers to in Chinese theology.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The most important statement in Chinese theology about the Trinity is that there should be "neither the confounding of persons nor the dividing of the body substance ."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The "persons" are the three Persons in the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That there should be no confounding of persons means that the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit; there should be no confounding of the three.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, the "body substance " is one and cannot be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the primary significance of the doctrine of the Trinity in Chinese theology.</S>
