<h2 class="head2">To Be Filled with the Spirit<br />
Being Miraculous</h2>
<p>Although being filled with the Spirit is not difficult, it is a great miracle. The Spirit is Christ, who is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9), and He has entered into us. Not only so, He desires to dwell in us (John 15:5) and to make home in our hearts (Eph. 3:17). The Greek word for <em>make home</em> is <em>kata,</em> meaning &ldquo;to enter deeply.&rdquo; When I travel, I am often received by the saints. Sometimes my host says, &ldquo;This is your room.&rdquo; I dare not use any other room, because I do not have the right to do so. However, when I am in my home, I have the right to put my belongings in any room according to my preference. This is what it means to make home. Even if I were to stay in a home as a guest for one year, I still would not be able to make my home there, because I am not the host. Only the host has such a right.</p>
<p>Christ is in us, but is He a guest or the host? Our heart has many parts: the conscience, the mind, the emotion, and the will. Our mind is a room, our emotion is another room, and our will is still another room. Sometimes we allow Christ to occupy only a part of our mind, not our whole mind. Sometimes we do not allow Him to occupy our emotions, and at other times we do not allow Him to occupy our will. This compels Him to remain in our spirit. As a result, instead of making His home in us, He is imprisoned. He wants to enter this room, but we do not allow Him; He wants to enter that room, but we disagree. Hence, He can remain only in our spirit; He is not allowed to enter into the other parts of our being. For this reason, we have no way to be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Although I have been a Christian for many years, I dare not say that all the rooms of my being&mdash;my conscience, my mind, my emotion, and my will&mdash;have been occupied by the Lord Jesus, but I can say that He has occupied much of my being. Christ should not be a guest or a prisoner in us; rather, He should be the Host who can settle down and make His home in us. According to Ephesians 3:19, the result of Christ making His home in our hearts is that we will be filled unto all the fullness of God. This means that if we would let Him gain ground in us, He will fill us. As God&rsquo;s vessels, we should be filled with only God (Rom. 9:23). Some vessels have been damaged and are filled with sand and clay. Other vessels are somewhat better and are filled with gold. Suppose we are vessels filled with gold. Would we still be willing to be fully emptied? When we are emptied, the Spirit will fill us. Perhaps we would say, &ldquo;Lord, if I were filled with filthy things or with vinegar or oil, I would be willing to be emptied and cleansed so that You could fill me. However, I am filled with gold and with jewels, which I treasure. Please let me keep them.&rdquo; We can choose not to be emptied, but then we will not be filled with God. In order to be filled with God, we must be emptied of everything, including what is worthless and what is valuable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practical Experience<br />
of Being Filled with the Spirit</h2>
<p>Hence, it is not difficult to be filled with the Spirit; rather, it is as easy as filling a vessel with air. It depends on whether or not we are willing to be emptied by giving up the things that we love. The sisters are reluctant to let go of purchasing items on sale every Saturday. If they continue to fill themselves with unnecessary sale items, they will not have room for the Spirit to fill them. If instead of going shopping they would be willing to pray for ten minutes to be strengthened inwardly and to be emptied of themselves, they would be filled with the Spirit. The young people are reluctant to give up the worldly way of styling their hair, which is according to fashion. If they were willing to give it up, they would be filled with the Spirit. It is very difficult for the brothers to choose a necktie. A brother who loves the Lord and desires to be used by the Lord may need to change his necktie in order to be useful. Being filled with the Spirit is rather easy, but it depends on whether we are willing to be emptied. Once we are emptied, we will be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is difficult to be filled with the Spirit, but on the other hand, it is easy. Ephesians 5:18-20 says that when we are filled with the Spirit, we will give thanks and praise. According to my experience, thanking and praising are, on the one hand, the issue of being filled with the Spirit and, on the other hand, the way to be filled with the Spirit. It is not easy for sisters to style their hair according to the spirit. It is difficult for them not to follow the fashion of the world when they go to the beauty parlor. However, if they would be willing to thank and praise the Lord while they are in the beauty parlor, saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I thank You and praise You; You are wonderful, and You are so lovely!&rdquo; they would be filled with the Spirit. In other words, if we can pray, we will be emptied of the unnecessary things in us. The more we pray in this way, the more we will be filled with the Spirit. Therefore, it is not hard to be filled with the Spirit, because we have a Lord who is worthy to be praised. As we praise Him, appreciate Him, and admire Him, we will spontaneously worship Him. This will help us to let go of and to be emptied of all our preferences and choices. As a result of being emptied, we will be filled with the Spirit.</p>
