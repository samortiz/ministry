   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SUBJECTIVE SEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is Jesus, and as the seed, the branch, and the fruit, He is so subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All these points are fully revealed in the Old Testament, but not merely in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jesus as a seed is altogether subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the seed, and we are the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The seed must get into the earth subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can the seed do anything in the earth unless it is sown into the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is much teaching today among Christians concerning Christ in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all know that Jesus was crucified on the cross for us, and now He is resurrected and sitting on the throne in the third heavens as the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is indeed right, but it is only the objective side.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He must get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the cross, He bruised the head of Satan, objectively, and now as the seed this bruising One is within us subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He comes into us, He flows His bruising life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today, Jesus bruises Satan within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times when the enemy begins to rise up within us against the building of God s house, this bruising life defeats him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today most of the Christian teachings are too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I first came to this country, I immediately began to tell the Christians to turn to their spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then I was asked why my teachings were always so subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not deny that there is the objective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jesus is really there in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But subjectively, He is in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Undoubtedly the electricity is in the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But it is also installed in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the electricity were merely objective, we would be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If it were only in the power plant, it would not benefit us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We would have no way to apply the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The application of the electricity is altogether involved with its entrance into our home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It has to be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If Jesus were only in the heavens, He would have nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But our Jesus is not only that kind of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On one hand He is in the heavens, but on the other hand He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I can boldly say that my Jesus is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I can even boast that Jesus is within me!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jesus is within me as a seed to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then He grows into a branch, and as a branch He branches God into me and bears fruit for others enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is this Jesus who builds God s temple, who builds up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He does it not in an objective way, but in a very subjective way, by sowing Himself into us, branching God into us, and bearing fruit for others enjoyment within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the Jesus that is prophesied in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>FORTY-TWO GENERATIONS FOR DIVINE SOWING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now we come to the first page of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations Matt 1:1, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Forty-two generations are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have seen that Jesus is God in the Son as the divine seed to be sown into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This sowing has not been easy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It needed forty-two generations as a preparation from Abraham through Isaac, through Israel, and through Judah, through many generations unto David, and through David s sons and grandsons, even through the Babylonian captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then, eventually, Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It took forty-two generations for this divine sowing, for Jesus to arrive here.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to many hymns, it seems that Jesus merely descended from the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But it was not like that.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Matthew says that it required forty-two generations.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Genesis says even more.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Matthew counted from Abraham, but Genesis counted from the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The seed was mentioned in Genesis 3, but from that day it took a long period of time for this seed to enter into human soil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is why the birth of Jesus was not merely a birth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It was the sowing of the divine seed into the human soil.</S>
