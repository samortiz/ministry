<h1 class=series>THE APPLICATION OF THE INTERPRETATION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM TO THE SEEKING BELIEVERS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE THREE</h1><h1 class=title>ITS WALL AND ITS FOUNDATIONS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:12a, 14a, 18a, 19-20; 4:3a</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upp-roman"><li>Its wall and its foundations are precious stones—Rev. 21:18a, 19-20:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>We, the believers in Christ, were created by God with dust (Gen. 2:7).</li>	<li>Through our regeneration by the Spirit we became stones (John 1:42).</li>	<li>By our growth in the divine life in Christ as the living stone (1 Pet. 2:4), we are transformed into precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12a):		<ol class="decimal">		<li>By the transformation of the Spirit—2 Cor. 3:18.</li>		<li>Through the renewing of our mind, the main part of our soul—Rom. 12:2.</li>		<li>Into the image of the glory of the firstborn Son of God—2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29.</li>		<li>All the stones of its wall and the first layer of its foundations are jasper (Rev. 21:18a, 19a), and the jasper stone signifies the appearance of God (4:3a), indicating that the entire city is in the appearance of God in His glory (21:11).</li>		</ol></li>	<li>While the transformation work of the Spirit is going on in the divine life, we, the transformed precious stones, are being built up together to be one complete wall with its foundations.</li>	<li>The functions of its wall and its foundations— 21:12a, 14:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To separate, to sanctify, the city unto God from all things other than God, thus making the city the holy city—21:2a, 10b.</li>		<li>To protect the interest of the riches of God’s divinity on the earth and the attainments of His consummation.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The colors of the twelve layers of its foundations— 21:19-20:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The colors of its foundations are like the colors of the rainbow:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The rainbow is God’s guarantee in His unfailing faithfulness that the earth will never be destroyed by the flood of water (Gen. 9:8-17).</li>		<li>But the fire as a destructive element (Gen. 19:24-25) will be used by God to punish all His enemies for eternity (Rev. 14:10-11; 21:8).</li>		</ol></li>	<li>This indicates that of the two destructive elements, water and fire, used by God to destroy all His opposers, one of them, that is, fire, will be used by God for this purpose for eternity, and the other, that is, water, will be prohibited from its destructive function by the guarantee of God’s unfailing faithfulness signified by the colors of its foundations. Water in eternity will be used by God only as an element of life supply (22:1-2).</li>	</ol></li></ol>
