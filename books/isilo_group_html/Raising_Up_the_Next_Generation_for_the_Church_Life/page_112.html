BEING THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
WITH HIS ALL-INCLUSIVE REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Before you begin to teach the young people in the Summer School of Truth, you yourself need to receive Paul&rsquo;s inoculation and be filled, soaked, and saturated with the truth. If you study 1 and 2 Timothy carefully, you will see that the structure of these two books is actually the structure of the truth and that the structure of the truth is the element of Paul&rsquo;s inoculation.</p>
<p>What is the element of this inoculation? What is the structure of the truth? Through a careful reading of 1 and 2 Timothy, we can realize that the structure of the truth is the Triune God with His all-inclusive redemption. God&rsquo;s redemption implies, or includes, salvation. Redemption has been accomplished by God. When God&rsquo;s accomplished redemption is applied to us, it becomes salvation. Thus, salvation is our experience of God&rsquo;s redemption. The structure of the divine truth is nothing less than the Triune God plus His redemption, which becomes our salvation.</p>
<p>In order to teach the young people in a living way, you need to learn all the aspects of the truth in the Scriptures concerning the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This means that you need to become saturated with the truth, the reality, of the Divine Trinity. Furthermore, you need to dive into the truth regarding the divine redemption&mdash;how it was planned by the Father, how it was accomplished by the Son, and how it is applied by the Spirit. Then you need to have a clear view of how the redemption accomplished by the Triune God becomes our full salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S FULL SALVATION</h2>
<p>The general subject of the first series of lessons in the Summer School of Truth is God&rsquo;s full salvation. The full salvation of God is actually equal to the truth, because the Triune God with His all-inclusive redemption is the structure of the truth. Through Paul&rsquo;s writings this truth has become an inoculation against the decline of Christianity. On the one hand, we may speak of the structure of the truth; on the other hand, we may speak of the element of the inoculation. This inoculation is like a dose of medicine containing various elements. The elements in the &ldquo;dose&rdquo; ministered by Paul as an inoculation are the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;and His all-inclusive redemption.</p>
<p>In helping the young people to experience God&rsquo;s full salvation, you have to unveil to them their fallen condition, which involves sin, Satan, and the world, the satanic system. These negative things are related to the actual condition of the saved ones. If we would experience and enjoy God&rsquo;s full salvation, we should consider our condition and its involvement, with sin, Satan, the world, and many other negative things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREPARING YOURSELF TO TEACH BY BEING SATURATED WITH THE TRUTH OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>As you prepare yourself to teach, you should not merely put your trust in the lesson book or in the compendium. You need to immerse yourself in the truth concerning God&rsquo;s full salvation. This means that you need to be saturated with a thorough knowledge, realization, and experience of the Triune God with His all-inclusive redemption in relation to all the aspects of man&rsquo;s fallen condition. To prepare yourself to teach, it is not adequate simply to read the lesson book. As a teacher in the Summer School of Truth, you need to be soaked and saturated with the truth. I hope that you will be impressed with your need to dive into the divine truth, which is the reality of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and of His all-inclusive redemption understood in relation to the condition of fallen man.</p>
<p>When you hear this, you may be troubled and feel that you are not qualified to teach the young people. I would urge you not to feel this way. Your experience may be limited, but the amount of experience you have qualifies you.</p>
<p>In your teaching do not speak peculiar things to arouse people&rsquo;s curiosity. Also, do not make a display of your knowledge about other subjects, such as history or science. It is shameful to make a display. You must be focused on God&rsquo;s economy and be restricted by God&rsquo;s economy. All of the class time, which is actually quite limited, should be used for presenting the truth of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Once again I wish to point out that you need to be fully soaked and saturated with the divine truth. The summer school should be a school not only to the students but also to all the teachers. I hope that you yourself will be the first one to learn the truth. You cannot teach others without first being taught yourself. Likewise, you cannot minister a certain thing to others without first experiencing and enjoying that matter yourself. You can minister to others only what you yourself have enjoyed. Otherwise, your teaching will be merely doctrinal and thus will be in vain.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_111.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_113.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Raising Up the Next Generation for the Church Life &nbsp; pg 112</div><br></body></html>
