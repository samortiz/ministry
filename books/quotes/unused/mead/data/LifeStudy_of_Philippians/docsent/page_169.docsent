   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEARNESS OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Immediately after speaking about forbearance, Paul goes on to say, The Lord is near.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As I have indicated, I do not oppose the understanding that this refers to the nearness of the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, according to experience, not according to doctrine, I would say that this word refers to the Lord s presence with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It also strengthens Paul s exhortation that we make our forbearance known to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because the Lord is near, we have no excuse for not making known our forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Often we fail to exercise forbearance because we forget that the Lord is near.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not even remember that He is actually within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a brother s wife serves him a cold drink instead of a hot one, will he care for the drink or for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If he cares about the drink instead of the Lord, then in his experience only the drink will be at hand, for the Lord will be far away.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because we do not realize that the Lord is near, we do not exercise forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, we are strict in dealing with others and make exacting demands of them without considering their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we realize the nearness of the Lord, the more satisfied we shall be and the more we shall be considerate of others and sweetly reasonable regarding their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we realize that the Lord is near, we shall turn from the old creation to the new creation, to the out-resurrection, which is expressed as forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE EXPRESSION OF THE OUT-RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For Jesus, the Nazarene, to live a life full of forbearance required that He live a life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only a life in the out-resurrection can be a life of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Forbearance is actually the expression of a living which is in the out-resurrection, in the new creation instead of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To let our forbearance be known to all men is not simply to be kind or patient.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, it is to let others see a proper Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This living is Christ as the out-resurrection expressed through forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CONSIDERING OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have emphasized the need of forbearance in the church life and in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are forbearing, we shall be considerate in dealing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, suppose one sister wants to help another sister improve her way of serving in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sister who wants to offer help needs to consider whether or not the sister she intends to help is able to receive correction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She should also consider whether in offering correction she herself is in the spirit or in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Forbearance requires that we not speak to others in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the contrary, we need to have much consideration before saying anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can damage brothers and sisters in the church and also members of our family by being too hasty in dealing with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I can testify that, as an elderly man, I now deal with my family in a way much different from the way I practiced forty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today I show much more forbearance than I did then.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Previously I stood on my position as a husband and father and said whatever I felt was necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, I learned that this practice was often harmful to others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now before saying certain things to my wife, I consider her and her situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I ask myself if she is able to bear what I intend to say and when is the right time to say it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I also consider how happy and comforted she is and how much she is able to receive what I desire to say to her.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All this is involved in showing forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord Jesus walked with the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, He displayed forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When He asked them what they were talking about, one of them replied, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Luke 24:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even though He knew all things, the Lord asked them, What things? v. 18 . Then He patiently listened to them while they told Him what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Later, at the appropriate time, the Lord made Himself known to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He certainly was forbearing with those disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we show forbearance toward others, they will be nourished, healed, and helped to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We shall not cause them to stumble or hurt them in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, because of our lack of forbearance, we have damaged others in the church and in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>LIVING IN THE OUT-RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I wish to emphasize the fact that forbearance is not a matter of ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Forbearance is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In chapters one, two, and three of Philippians, Paul has much to say concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then in 4:5 he speaks of forbearance, not of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Actually, when he says, Let your forbearance be known to all men, he is saying, Let Christ be manifested and magnified before all men.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After speaking about living Christ, magnifying Christ, taking Christ as the pattern, and pursuing Christ as the goal, Paul indicates that we need to live this Christ as our forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We all need the Lord to be our forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To live Him as forbearance is truly to live in the out-resurrection.</S>
