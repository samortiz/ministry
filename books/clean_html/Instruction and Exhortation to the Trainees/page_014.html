<P>Question: Besides the work of the apostles to raise up churches and the work of the churches to enlarge and grow, is there any other aspect of the work in the New Testament?</P><P>Answer: According to my knowledge, there is not. The work is carried out either by the gifted persons or by the churches. The gifted persons should help the work of the church to perfect the saints. They should not build up their own work, but carry on the work of the church. Eventually, the gifted persons do not have any work. Whatever they do is mingled with the work of the church. Eventually, all of this becomes the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ.</P><P>Question: At the end of the message, you shared that our present way to carry out the training is with two terms. After the second term of training, we can labor here for a year to practice under the training. On the other hand, your fellowship is that we go back to our sending church. Can you clarify this?</P><P>Answer: After one year of training, you may go back to work at a job and serve with the church which sent you. If the church that sent you agrees, you can practice the second year somewhere else. If so, it is better that you try to receive additional help from the training. The training will continue to bear the burden to give you some help. For example, you may go back to your sending church and be willing to be under the training. The training will give you some further help to serve in that locality. But, it is better to ask your sending church to let you stay in the training for two years. If the church that sends you agrees with this, you have the freedom to manage these two years. The training will also have the freedom to train you during these two years. This is the best. In any case, after two years you must go back. Maybe some of the churches cannot afford to give you the full supply for two years. They may support you for only one year. Again, if the sending church can give you two whole years to complete your training, that is the best.</P>
