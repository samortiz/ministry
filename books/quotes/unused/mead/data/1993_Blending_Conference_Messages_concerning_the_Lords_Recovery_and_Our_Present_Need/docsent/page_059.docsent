   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Overcomers within the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to see the overcomers within the churches Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we want to be overcomers within the churches, we need to overcome four "isms": Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Brethrenism Rev 2:9, 20; 3:1-2, 15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These "isms" are part of a big religious system organized by Satan, out of which the Lord's children need to come Rev 18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During the Lord's time on earth and during the time of the early apostles, Judaism was strongly opposing God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those in Judaism opposed the Lord Jesus Matt 12:9-14; Luke 4:28-29; John 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They also opposed the apostle Paul Acts 13:45-46, 50; 14:1-2, 19; 17:1, 5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Revelation 2:9b the Lord refers to "the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse reveals that Judaism is satanic in opposing the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also need to overcome Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church in Thyatira signifies this apostate church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Catholicism is portrayed as the woman Jezebel who calls herself a prophetess, teaching and leading the people of God, even with "the deep things of Satan" Rev 2:20, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Within the Catholic Church are demonic things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not according to our word but according to the Lord's word in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord has made clear to us that there is a system organized by Satan against His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Protestantism is seen mainly with the church in Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those in Sardis have a name that they are living when they are actually dead Rev 3:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This shows that Protestantism is devoid of Christ as the living One and is hence Christless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brethrenism is seen mainly with the church in Laodicea where the Lord is standing outside the door of the degraded church and knocking at her door v. 20 . This situation is characterized by lukewarmness v. 16 . In order to be the testimony of Jesus today, we need to overcome these "isms." We need to overcome the system of Satan which opposes the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This system causes us to be affected in our love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The very first thing that happens to the church in its degradation is the loss of Christ as the first love Rev 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the degradation comes in through the loss of the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Ephesians 6:24 Paul said, "Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we love the Lord in all the incorruptible things, we are saved from corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But as soon as we get led away from that love, corruption starts to come in.</S>
