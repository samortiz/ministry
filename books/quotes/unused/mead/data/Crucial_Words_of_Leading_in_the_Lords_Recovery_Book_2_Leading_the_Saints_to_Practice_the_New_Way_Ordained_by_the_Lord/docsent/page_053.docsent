   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES Scripture Reading: Matt 28:20; 1 Tim 6:3; Matt 16:16-18; Eph 3:5; Col 2:2; Eph 3:4; 5:32; Jude 3; 1 Tim 1:3-4; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 Cor 16:12; Acts 13:2, 4; 2 John 9-11</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ministry of the New Testament is to build up the Body of Christ according to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The teaching of the apostles is a special term in the Bible Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It has a deep and strong background, that is, Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Outwardly speaking, Judaism is linked to the Old Testament, which existed among the Jews for one thousand five hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During the period of time beginning with Moses and continuing until the coming of the Lord Jesus, Judaism became strongly and firmly established among the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the Jewish people, men and women, young and old, had a deep impression of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their conversations, practices, and daily life were all according to the law of Moses, that is, the teachings of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason, God even arranged for a group of priests, who were required to come before God every day to offer sacrifices, burn incense, and light the lampstand in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These same ones also bore a commission before man, that is, to speak and teach the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ALL THE THINGS THAT THE LORD JESUS COMMANDED</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Lord Jesus came, He was the first one who kept the law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It can be said that ever since the law was given through Moses, no one had ever fully kept the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only Jesus of Nazareth fully kept the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, He also complemented the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the law was good, it was not good enough; although the law was complete, it was not sufficiently complete.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, the law says, You shall not kill Exo 20:13 , but the law does not say, You shall not hate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, in Matthew 5:22 in His teaching on the mountain, the Lord Jesus complemented the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He told His disciples, Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Anger is the motive of murder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus not only dealt with murder but also with the inward motive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The law says, You shall love your neighbor v. 43 , yet if we love only our neighbors, only the good ones, what shall we do with those who are not good, such as our enemies? Hence, the law is incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord told us as a complement to the law, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you v. 44 . On the one hand, the Lord Jesus kept the law of God, and on the other hand, he complemented the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such matters as keeping dietary regulations and keeping the Sabbath are matters of ceremonial law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one can fulfill the ceremonial law because no one can be man s food and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when the Lord Jesus came, He was the rest typified by the Sabbath and the reality of the various offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only He was able to fulfill the ceremonial part of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not abolish the law but fulfilled and complemented it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He fulfilled every item in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second paragraph of footnote 2 in Matthew 5:17 reads, Concerning the law there are two aspects: the commandments of the law and the principle of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The commandments of the law were fulfilled and complemented by the Lord s coming, whereas the principle of the law was replaced by the principle of faith according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord said, Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through keeping the law, the Lord complemented the law and fulfilled all the commandments of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the law of the Old Testament the ten main commandments, such as to honor one s parents and not to steal, concern human ethics and man s relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord kept, fulfilled, and complemented all the laws of the moral commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Bible there is the testimony of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Old Testament age the principle of God s dealing with man was according to the testimony of the law and based on the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If man did well and was perfect, he could live; otherwise, he had to die.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, we see that when man kept the law, he was justified, but when man disobeyed the law, he was condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was the principle with which God dealt with man in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This principle is based on the law and has nothing to do with faith; therefore, we can say that in relationship to the law, faith is not found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord Jesus came, He fulfilled and complemented the law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He put the law aside, and thereafter, the principle by which God deals with man was no longer based on the law but on faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, faith became the principle with which God deals with man in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This faith, that is, the faith, is what we believe in. The contents of the entire New Testament are in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God deals with us based on the principle of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whoever believes is justified; whoever does not believe is condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is entirely different from the principle of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Old Testament is based on the principle of keeping the law; the New Testament is based on the principle of believing in the Lord Jesus, that is, on the principle of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we understand the law in this way, we will be clear concerning it.</S>
