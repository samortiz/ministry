   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this message we want to see the way to receive revelation from the holy Word and see vision through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I. THE WAY TO RECEIVE REVELATION FROM THE HOLY WORD A. To Read the Holy Word and Apprehend Its Contents in Facts 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To Be Familiar with the Text</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To receive revelation from the holy Word, we must read the Word and apprehend its contents in facts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we want to receive revelation from Genesis 1, we first have to read this chapter with our understanding and with our memory to apprehend the contents.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to know that Genesis 1 is a record of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, God created man and put this man in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These facts are very important.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By the Help of the Original Text Hebrew and Greek</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To apprehend the facts we need the help of the original text in Hebrew and Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No translation of the Bible is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why, if possible, we should study Hebrew, the Old Testament language, and Greek, the New Testament language.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can also use the help of certain word studies of the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By Learning to Know the Types</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also need to learn to know the types figures and shadows in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Old Testament is full of types.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nearly everything in Genesis 1 is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 5:14 tells us that Adam is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Song of Songs, a short book of eight chapters, is full of figures and shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this book Christ is the henna flower 1:14 , the myrrh v. 13 , and the apple tree 2:3 . Eventually, Christ came to be the vine tree John 15:1 , and ultimately the tree of life Gen 2:9; Rev 22:2 . B. To Receive the Divine Revelation by Exercising Our Spirit to Contact the Lord through Pray-reading 1.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not by Our Natural Understanding Ability</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, we need to read the holy Word to apprehend its contents.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To read is by our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we need to receive the divine revelation, not by exercising our natural understanding ability, but by exercising our spirit to contact the Lord through pray-reading Eph 6:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I came to the United States to minister the word in the early sixties, many people told me that they had never before heard about the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That shocked me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not know that we have a spirit or how to exercise, to use, our spirit, we cannot receive revelation from the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without the exercise of the spirit, the holy Word remains only in letters, in facts, but it cannot be a revelation to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we exercise our spirit, the written Word becomes the spiritual word, the word which is the Spirit, to be received not by our mind but by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord because the Lord Himself is the Word John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Word, which is God, is God's breathing, the Spirit 2 Tim 3:16; Eph 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must exercise the spirit to contact the Lord through pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Exercising our spirit, contacting the Lord, and pray-reading must be added together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The term pray-read is based upon Ephesians 6:17-18, which says that we are to receive the word of God, which word is the Spirit, by means of all kinds of prayer, praying at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In these verses, we have the word, the Spirit of God, and our spirit exercised in pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Revelation comes from receiving the word, not just by the mind to understand it, but by the spirit exercised to contact the Lord through pray-reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we pray-read, we have to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not by Our Fanciful Imaginations</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We receive the divine revelation not by our natural understanding ability or by our fanciful imaginations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some Christians, especially those who are Seventh-day Adventists, understand parts of the Bible by exercising their imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mrs. White, who established the Seventh-day Adventists, told people a specific date on which Christ would return.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some of them prepared to receive Christ on that date, but He did not come.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She also wrongly taught that Christians should keep the Sabbath day of the Old Testament.</S>
