   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Acts 14:23 says that eventually elders were appointed in every church.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Afterward, Paul ordered Titus to appoint elders in every city Titus 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Testament indicates that the elders were not voted in by their congregations, but were appointed by the apostles according to their maturity of life in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They were charged by the apostles to care for the leadership and the shepherding in their churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1 Peter 5:2 Peter gives the elders a charge concerning shepherding: "Shepherd the flock of God among you."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Literally, the Greek word rendered "flock" is little flock.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This refers to the church of God Acts 20:28 , which is small in number Luke 12:32 compared to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to 1 Peter 5:2, elders are not rulers; they are shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes a shepherd may have to rule the flock, but that is not the ruling of a king.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a ruling of someone who cares for the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Shepherding is a proper care exercised over the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The flock needs to be cared for, protected, led in the right direction, and brought to a place where they can eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 5:2 Peter does not tell the elders to shepherd their own flock.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, he charges them to shepherd the flock of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The flock is not the elders' possession but is God's possession.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a sense, the elders are employed by God to shepherd His flock.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament elders are also called overseers Phil 1:1; 1 Tim 3:1; 1 Pet 5:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Greek word translated "overseer" is episkopos, from epi meaning over and skopos meaning seer; hence, overseer bishop, from Latin episcopus .</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity, and overseer, denoting the function of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When an elder is carrying out his responsibility in the church, he is functioning as an overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When an elder functions he exercises oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The overseers, therefore, are not a group of people different from the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was Ignatius in the second century who taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This teaching is also the source of the Episcopal system of ecclesiastical government.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both the hierarchy and the system are abominable in the eyes of God.</S>
