   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TITHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 6 also mentions the tithes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is not a course.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means one tenth of your produce.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a total title of all the groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the groceries are tithes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One tenth, the top part, of your produce is set apart for God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE HEAVE OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The heave offering is also mentioned in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The heave offering is not the main offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It may be considered a subordinate offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The heave offering also includes the wave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The heave offering refers to the ascension, and when you mention the ascension, resurrection is included also.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When you speak of resurrection, you may not have the ascension, but when you speak of the ascension, resurrection is also included.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as the burnt offering includes all of the following offerings so the heave offering includes the foregoing offering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The foregoing offering to the heave offering is the wave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Resurrection goes before ascension, and ascension follows resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So there is the burnt offering as the leading offering, and there is the heave offering as the ending offering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The burnt offering is the leading one of the main offerings, and the heave offering is one of the subordinate offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE OFFERINGS OF YOUR VOWS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 6 the phrase and your vows is better translated, and of your vows.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The whole phrase should read, The heave offerings of your hand, and of your vows.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are two things here.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the offerings offered to God are produced from the land by the labor of the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That offering was required just like today we have to pay income tax.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Income tax is required today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Tithing actually was a kind of income tax.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first offering was required as a produce from your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the second is offered for a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That is not required.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, you are required to pay a certain amount of income tax, but besides the income tax you paid, you give the government something more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That is not a required tax; that is a kind of payment of your vow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That is a kind of a payment based upon your patriotism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because you love your country you want to give your country something more than is required.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was the same with the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether you loved God or didn t love God, as long as you were an Israelite you had to bring in the tax.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of all your produce, one tenth should be brought in. This may be likened to the income tax.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you don t pay your income tax you will get into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The government may fine you or may put you into jail.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the vow is different.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The vow means you like to give something more than what is required by the government because you are so patriotic.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE FREEWILL OFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The freewill offerings are also mentioned in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is the difference between the offerings of the vow and the freewill offerings?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The offerings of the vow were for a promise that you made.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You promised to give a certain amount.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes the church may practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Six years ago when we were preparing to build this hall we didn t know how much the saints could or would give, so we asked many of you to write a kind of promise to the church telling us what you would give.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many of us including myself wrote a kind of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That became a vow to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every month we put in a certain amount to fulfill our vows.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But besides that, some still gave something more.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was a freewill offering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was voluntary.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some gave what they promised for the hall plus something more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The extra portion became the voluntary offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The offerings for the vow are stronger, and the tithe was even much stronger because that was to fulfill a requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The vow implies partially a kind of free will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you never made such a vow you are not obligated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But whether we make a vow or don t make a vow we still have to pay the income tax.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>According to the Pentateuch all the offerings are of these three degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The tithes are the strongest, the vows are weaker, and the voluntary offerings are the weakest.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>FIRSTLINGS OF THE HERDS AND OF THE FLOCKS</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>From these verses we can see what are the main courses of the divine feast and what are the groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus far we haven t gotten to the groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But now we come to the last item, the seventh: And the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These are items of the groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Firstly, it speaks of the firstlings of your herd, and secondly, the firstlings of your flocks.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The herds refer to oxen, and the flocks refer to sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now there are two kinds of groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The firstlings of the herds and of the flocks are the first two items of the groceries.</S>
